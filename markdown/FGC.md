#### DIVISION 1. FISH AND GAME COMMISSION [101 - 500]  


##### CHAPTER 1. Organization [101 - 110]  

######### 101.  
There is in the Resources Agency the Fish and Game Commission created by Section 20 of Article IV of the Constitution.



######### 101.5.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares that the scope and responsibilities of the commission have significantly expanded over the years as the size and diversity of California’s population have increased, and as the scientific knowledge of the habitat conservation and ecosystem-based management needs of wildlife has expanded. The members of the commission are expected to make complex public policy and biological decisions on behalf of the people of California. The commission is created by the California Constitution, which does not include any criteria or qualifications for selection and appointment of commissioners.

(b) It is therefore the intent of the Legislature to encourage the Governor and the Senate Committee on Rules to consider the following minimum qualifications in selecting, appointing, and confirming commissioners to serve on the commission:

(1) The degree to which the appointee will enhance the diversity of background and geographic representation of the commission.

(2) The appointee’s demonstrated interest and background in, and familiarity with, wildlife and natural resources management programs at the state or federal level.

(3) The appointee’s previous experience in public policy decisionmaking, including government processes involving public participation.

(4) The appointee’s commitment to prepare for and attend meetings and subcommittee meetings of the commission and to comply with all applicable state conflict-of-interest laws.

(5) The extent of the appointee’s exposure to and experience with the basic science underpinning the management of living natural resources.

(6) The appointee’s diversity of knowledge of natural resource issues and related scientific disciplines, including, but not limited to, outdoor recreation.



######### 102.  
(a) The commissioners shall annually elect one of their number as president and one as vice president, by a concurrent vote of at least three commissioners.

(b) The president or vice president may be removed from the position of president or vice president by a vote, at any time, of at least three commissioners.

(c) In the event of a vacancy in either the position of president or vice president, the commission shall fill that vacancy at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the commission. The elected successor president or vice president shall serve for the unexpired term of the predecessor until the annual election pursuant to subdivision (a).

(d) The commission may not adopt or enforce a policy or a regulation that provides for the president and vice president to be chosen by seniority nor may the commission adopt or enforce any other policy or regulation that would make a commissioner ineligible to be elected as president or vice president of the commission.



######### 103.  
(a) Each of the commissioners shall receive one hundred dollars ($100) for each day of actual service performed in carrying out his or her official duties pursuant to law, but the amount of this compensation shall not exceed for any one commissioner the sum of five hundred dollars ($500) for any one calendar month. In addition to this compensation, the commissioners shall receive their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties.

(b) The compensation and expenses provided in this section shall be paid out of the Fish and Game Preservation Fund.



######### 104.  
The commission may employ a staff, including an executive director, to assist the commission in conducting its operations, but neither the commission nor its staff shall have or be given any powers in relation to the administration of the department.



######### 105.  
The commission shall form a marine resources committee from its membership consisting of at least one commissioner.  The committee shall report to the commission from time to time on its activities and shall make recommendations on all marine resource matters considered by the commission.

######### 106.  
The commission shall form a wildlife resources committee from its membership consisting of at least one commissioner. The committee shall report to the commission from time to time on its activities and shall make recommendations on all nonmarine resource matters considered by the commission. The committee or its designee shall, to the extent practicable, attend meetings of the department staff, including meetings of the department staff with interested parties, in which significant wildlife resource management documents are being developed.



######### 106.5.  
The commission shall form a tribal committee from its membership consisting of at least one commissioner. The committee shall report to the commission from time to time on its activities and shall make recommendations on all tribal matters considered by the commission. The committee or its designee shall, to the extent practicable, attend meetings of the department staff, including meetings of the department staff with interested parties, in which significant tribal management documents are being developed. 



######### 107.  
The commission shall adopt a code of conduct that requires, at a minimum, that a commissioner adhere to the following principles:

(a) A commissioner shall faithfully discharge the duties, responsibilities, and quasi-judicial actions of the commission.

(b) A commissioner shall conduct his or her affairs in the public’s best interest, following principles of fundamental fairness and due process of law.

The commission may also hold special meetings or hearings to receive additional input from the department and the public.

(b) The commission shall announce the dates and locations of meetings for the year by January 1 of that year, or 60 days prior to the first meeting, whichever comes first.

Such conservation shall be in accordance with the principles of conservation of wildlife resources set forth in Section 1801 and in accordance with the objectives and elements stated in “A Plan for California Deer, 1976.”



######### 451.  
As used in this chapter “general deer hunting season” means the annual season for the area in question as is set by the commission under its general regulatory powers, or set by statute, for the taking of male deer.



######### 452.  
The department shall designate deer herd management units and designate the manager for the units. Such units may encompass a single deer herd or a group of deer herds having similar management and habitat requirements and characteristics. Boundaries of such units, unless appropriate, need not follow county boundary lines.



######### 453.  
The department shall develop plans for such deer herd management units. The objectives of such plans shall be the restoration and maintenance of healthy deer herds in the wild state and to provide for high quality and diversified use of deer in California.



######### 454.  
Such management plans shall contain the following program elements:

(a) Document existing information on deer herd management units and programs to obtain information that may be needed.

(b) Develop programs to maintain and increase the quality of deer habitat statewide.  Such programs will emphasize cooperative action between the department and the appropriate land management entities, both public and private.  Emphasis shall be directed towards identifying critical deer habitat areas and the maintenance and management of such areas.

(c) Develop programs to reduce natural mortalities where such reduction may be critical to meeting deer herd plan objectives.

(d) Develop programs to decrease the illegal taking of deer through modern law enforcement methods supported by public and private cooperative efforts.

(e) Develop diversified recreational use programs, including both hunting and nonhunting uses, consistent with the basic individual deer herd management unit capabilities.



######### 455.  
Deer herd management unit plans shall be reviewed annually and shall be the basis for department recommendations to the commission pursuant to this chapter.



######### 456.  
The department shall biennially report to the Legislature and to the Fish and Game Commission on the progress that is being made toward the restoration and maintenance of California’s deer herds. The first report shall be submitted on or before October 1, 1989. The report shall include program activities regarding deer habitat, particularly addressing problems dealing with identification and preservation of critical deer habitat areas; the amount of revenue derived from the sale of deer tags during the two previous fiscal years; a list of expenditures during the two previous fiscal years and proposed expenditures during the current fiscal year; and a report of general benefits accrued to the deer resources as a result of the program.



######### 457.  
The department shall determine prior to December 15 of each year its proposed recommendations to the commission, including its recommendations as to whether any antlerless deer hunts should be ordered. The recommendations of the department shall include the number, if any, of antlerless deer that should be taken in units, whether the permits should be either-sex permits, the proposed dates for each such taking, and the number of permits proposed for each unit.



######### 458.  
The department not later than December 15 shall notify, by certified mail, the board of supervisors of each county affected of the details of its recommendations under Section 457.

The board of supervisors of any affected county may elect to hold a public hearing on the proposed recommendations of the department.  Any such hearing shall be held prior to February 1.  The director or his or her representative shall attend the hearing.

The board of supervisors of any county to which this section is applicable may, by resolution, elect not to exercise the rights conferred by this section.

This section applies only to the counties of, and to those districts or parts of districts in, Siskiyou, Modoc, Trinity, Shasta, Lassen, Plumas, Sierra, Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, Colusa, Del Norte, El Dorado, Glenn, Humboldt, Imperial, Inyo, Lake, Madera, Mariposa, Mendocino, Merced, Mono, Monterey, Napa, Nevada, Orange, Placer, Riverside, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Tehama, Tuolumne, Yolo, and Yuba Counties.



######### 459.  
The board of supervisors of any county specified in Section 458 which has held a public hearing pursuant to Section 458 may, not later than February 1, by resolution, object to the proposed recommendations of the department or may, by resolution, determine that the proposed recommendation should be modified, setting forth the necessary modifications.

A resolution objecting to, or setting forth modifications of, the proposed recommendations shall be based upon the testimony and information presented at the hearing or presented to the board of supervisors at its meeting to consider the resolution.

The department shall not recommend to the commission, and the commission shall not authorize, the taking of antlerless deer in a county specified in Section 458 if it has received from the board of supervisors of that county a resolution objecting to that taking.  If a board of supervisors of a county has submitted a resolution determining that the department’s proposed recommendations on the taking of antlerless deer should be modified for that county, the department shall either so modify its recommendations and the commission shall so modify its orders or the department shall not recommend, and the commission shall not authorize, the taking of antlerless deer in that county.



######### 460.  
Prior to each meeting of the commission at which the commission considers the regulation of deer and takes action pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 255, the department shall recommend to the commission those deer herd units to be placed under a general deer hunting season. At the same time, the department shall recommend to the commission, subject to the provisions of Sections 458 and 459, whether any antlerless deer should be taken and in what deer herd units antlerless deer are to be taken. If in the judgment of the department there are deer herd units in which hunting pressure would adversely affect the deer herd, impair the hunting experience, or endanger the public safety, the department shall also recommend to the commission those deer herd units where hunter numbers should be restricted and which should be removed from the general deer hunting season designation. The department shall inform the commission of the condition of each deer herd unit. Upon receipt of the recommendations and information required in this section, the commission shall make that material known to the public and its determinations regarding proposed regulations. The recommendations of the department shall, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 458 and 459, include the number, if any, of antlerless deer that should be taken in deer herd units, whether the permits should be either-sex permits, the proposed dates for the taking, and the number of permits proposed for each deer herd unit. At the same time, the department shall recommend the establishment of any hunter-restricted quota units, if needed, and the number of the quota and manner in which the quota permits should be issued.







##### CHAPTER 6. Damages from Poaching and Illegal Sales [500- 500.]  

######### 500.  
(a) The commission shall, by regulation, adopt guidelines to assist the director and the department in ascertaining the amount of civil penalties to be imposed pursuant to Section 2582 or 2583.  The guidelines may include monetary amounts or ranges of monetary amounts that the commission finds are adequate to deter illegal actions and partially compensate the people of California for losses to the fish and wildlife resources from illegal transactions described in Section 2582 or 2583 for profit or personal gain.

(b) If the violation involves birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, or fish with a value in the aggregate of less than four hundred dollars ($400) and involves only the transportation, taking, or receipt of fish or wildlife taken or possessed in violation of this code, the guidelines shall provide that the civil penalty shall not exceed the maximum criminal fine provided by law for the violation in this code or ten thousand dollars ($10,000), whichever is less.  For  purposes of this section, “value” means the retail market value if a market value exists, the potential monetary gain to the accused or, for commercial species, the established retail market value.

(c) The guidelines shall include consideration of the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the prohibited acts committed, and the degree of culpability of the violator, including lesser penalties for acts which have little significant effect upon the resources and greater penalties for acts which may cause serious injury to the resources.

(d) Nothing in this chapter or in Chapter 6.5 (commencing with Section 2580) of Division 3 shall be used to establish a monetary value for fish or wildlife resources in connection with any development, project, or land or water use plan or activity as permitted by any federal, state, or local governmental activity.  This chapter does not apply to any action brought to recover civil damages under Section 2014.





#### DIVISION 2. DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE [700 - 1958]  

#### CHAPTER 1. Organization and General Functions [700 - 715]  


##### ARTICLE 1. Generally [700 - 715]  

######### 700.  
(a) There is in the Natural Resources Agency a Department of Fish and Wildlife administered through the director.

(b) The Department of Fish and Wildlife shall succeed to, and is vested with, all the duties, powers, purposes, responsibilities, property, and jurisdiction previously vested in the Department of Fish and Game.

(d) No existing supplies, forms, insignias, signs, logos, uniforms, or emblems shall be destroyed or changed as a result of changing the name of the Department of Fish and Game to the Department of Fish and Wildlife, and those materials shall continue to be used until exhausted or unserviceable.



######### 701.  
The director shall be appointed by the Governor, and receive the annual salary provided for by Chapter 6 (commencing at Section 11550) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.



######### 701.3.  
There shall be one deputy director of the department who shall be a civil executive officer and shall be appointed by the Governor and serve at the pleasure of the Governor. The compensation of the deputy director shall be fixed by the director pursuant to law. The deputy director shall have such duties as shall be assigned, from time to time, by the director, and shall be responsible to the director for the performance thereof.



######### 701.5.

Such office of director or alternate director of a joint powers entity is deemed compatible with the office of director and the office or employment of such persons as the director may so designate to serve such an entity established by a joint powers agreement.



######### 702.  
This code shall be administered and enforced through regulations adopted only by the department, except as otherwise specifically provided by this code or where this code requires the commission to adopt regulations.



######### 702.1.  
(a) The department, on or before January 1, 2016,  shall prepare and submit to the relevant policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature a feasibility study report on an electronic system to manage citations issued by fish and game wardens, exchange information on citations with the courts, and transfer data on court dispositions to the Automated License Data System.

If the department has no comment to make on the proposed timber harvesting plan, it is not required to submit a response.



######### 703.3.  
It is the policy of the state that the department and commission use ecosystem-based management informed by credible science in all resource management decisions to the extent feasible. It is further the policy of the state that scientific professionals at the department and commission, and all resource management decisions of the department and commission, be governed by a scientific quality assurance and integrity policy, and follow well-established standard protocols of the scientific profession, including, but not limited to, the use of peer review, publication, and science review panels where appropriate. Resource management decisions of the department and commission should also incorporate adaptive management to the extent possible.



######### 703.5.  
It is the policy of the state as follows:

 (a) That the department and the commission seek to create, foster, and actively participate in effective partnerships and collaborations with other agencies and stakeholders to achieve shared goals and to better integrate fish and wildlife resource conservation and management with the natural resource management responsibilities of other agencies.

 (b) That the department and commission participate in interagency coordination processes that facilitate consistency and efficiency in review of projects requiring multiple permits, including, but not necessarily limited to, joint state, federal, and local permit review teams that enable early consultation with project applicants, and provide improved sharing of data, information, tools, and science to achieve better alignment of planning, policies, and regulations across agencies.



######### 704.  
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the director is the appointing power of all employees within the department, and all employees in the department are responsible to the director for the proper carrying out of the duties and responsibilities of their respective positions.

(b) The changes made to subdivision (a) during the 2001–02 Regular Session of the Legislature are declaratory of existing law.



######### 705.  
(a) For purposes of this section, “eligible renewable energy resources” has the same meaning as in the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program (Article 16 (commencing with Section 399.11) of Chapter 2.3 of Part 1 of Division 1 of the Public Utilities Code).

(b) The department shall establish an internal division with the primary purpose of performing comprehensive planning and environmental compliance services with priority given to projects involving the building of eligible renewable energy resources.

(c) The internal division shall ensure the timely completion of plans pursuant to the Natural Community Conservation Planning Act (Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 2800) of Division 3).



######### 706.  
The provisions of Chapter 2 (commencing at Section 11150) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code shall govern and apply to the conduct of the department in every respect. Whenever in that chapter the term “head of the department” or similar designation occurs, for the purposes of this section it shall mean the director.



######### 707.  
It is the duty of the attorney for the department to act as counsel in defense of any officer or deputy of the department in any suit for damages brought against the officer or deputy on account of injuries to persons or property alleged to have been received as a result of the negligence or misconduct of the officer or deputy occurring while the officer or deputy was performing his official duties.



######### 709.  
A nonprofit organization designated by the department to assist in the sale of deer, elk, antelope, or bighorn sheep fundraising tags that are sold on behalf of the department for the purpose of raising funds for specified programs and projects, pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 331, subdivision (d) of Section 332, subdivision (a) of Section 4334, or subdivision (d) of Section 4902, is authorized to retain 5 percent of the amount of the sale price of the tag as a reasonable vendor fee.



######### 710.  
The Legislature finds and declares that the department has in the past not been adequately funded to meet its mandates. The principal causes have been the fixed nature of the department’s revenues in contrast with the rising costs resulting from inflation, the increased burden on the department to carry out its public trust responsibilities, and additional responsibilities placed on the department by the Legislature. This lack of funding has prevented proper planning and manpower allocation. The lack of funding has required the department to restrict warden enforcement and to defer essential management of lands acquired for wildlife conservation. The lack of funding for fish and wildlife conservation activities other than sport and commercial fishing and hunting activities has resulted in inadequate wildlife and habitat conservation and wildlife protection programs.



######### 710.5.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares that the department continues to be inadequately funded to meet its mandates. While revenues have been declining, the department’s responsibilities have increased in order to protect public trust resources in the face of increasing population and resource management demands. The department’s revenues have been limited due to a failure to maximize user fees and inadequate non-fee-related funding. The limited department revenues have resulted in the inability of the department to effectively provide all of the programs and activities required under this code and to manage the wildlife resources held in trust by the department for the people of the state.

(b) The Legislature further finds and declares that the department has been largely supported by fees paid by those who utilize the resources held in trust by the department. It is the intent of the Legislature that, to the extent feasible, the department should continue to be funded by user fees. All fees collected by the department, including, but not limited to, recreational hunting and fishing licenses, landing fees, commercial licenses, permits and entitlements, and other fees for use of the resources regulated or managed by the department, are user fees. To the extent that these fees are appropriated through the Budget Act for the purposes for which they are collected to provide services to the people of the State of California, these user fees are not subject to Article XIII B of the California Constitution.

(c) The Legislature further finds and declares that user fees are not sufficient to fund all of the department’s mandates. To fulfill its mandates, the department must secure a significant increase in reliable funding, in addition to user fees.



######### 710.7.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(1) The department continues to face serious funding instability due to revenue declines from traditional user fees and taxes and the addition of new and expanded program responsibilities.

(2) Historically, the recreational and commercial fishing industry has funded much of the department’s marine fisheries activities.

(3) As the state’s population grows and development changes historic land uses, fish and wildlife continue to be depleted, necessitating a significant portion of the department’s activities to be directed toward protecting fish and wildlife for the benefit of the people of the state.

(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to extend the current user-based funding system by allocating a portion of the marine resource protection costs to those who use and benefit from recreational and commercial use of the marine resources.

(c) It is the Legislature’s intent that, notwithstanding Section 711, the department shall cooperate with the Legislature, recreational users, conservation organizations, the commercial fishing industry, and other interested parties to identify and propose new alternative sources of revenue to fund the department’s necessary marine conservation, restoration, and resources management, and protection responsibilities.

(d) It is further the intent of the Legislature to identify new funding sources and to secure those sources to adequately fund the department’s activities directed at protecting and managing wildlife for the people of the state.



######### 711.  
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure adequate funding from appropriate sources for the department. To this end, the Legislature finds and declares that:

(2) The costs of commercial fishing programs shall be provided out of revenues from commercial fishing landing fees, license fees, and other revenues, from reimbursements and federal funds received for commercial fishing programs, and other funds appropriated by the Legislature for this purpose.

(3) The costs of hunting and sportfishing programs shall be provided out of hunting and sportfishing revenues and reimbursements and federal funds received for hunting and sportfishing programs, and other funds appropriated by the Legislature for this purpose. These revenues, reimbursements, and federal funds shall not be used to support commercial fishing programs, free hunting and fishing license programs, or nongame fish and wildlife programs.

(4) The costs of managing lands managed by the department and the costs of wildlife management programs shall be supplemented out of revenues in the Native Species Conservation and Enhancement Account in the Fish and Game Preservation Fund.

(5) Hunting, sportfishing, and sport ocean fishing license fees shall be adjusted annually to an amount equal to that computed pursuant to Section 713. However, a substantial increase in the aggregate of hunting and sportfishing programs shall be reflected by appropriate amendments to the sections of this code that establish the base sport license fee levels. The inflationary index provided in Section 713 shall not be used to accommodate a substantial increase in the aggregate of hunting and sportfishing programs.

(6) The costs of a conservation and mitigation banking program, including, but not limited to, costs incurred by the department during its adoption of guidelines for, and the review, approval, establishment, monitoring, and oversight of, banks, shall be reimbursed from revenues of conservation and mitigation bank application fees imposed pursuant to Sections 1798.5, 1798.6, and 1799.

######### 1000.6.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(1) The commercial fishing industry of the North Coast has been greatly affected by decisions made by federal and state agencies concerning the health of the salmon resource and the consequent shortening or closing of the season, further impacting the already economically depressed region.

(2) Sportfishing on the North Coast, a staple of the tourism industry of the region, could be substantially affected by the limitations of the salmon seasons. 

(3) The method of determining salmon escapement counts on only the Klamath River is inadequate for determining the overall health of the salmon resource in northern California waters and consequent decisions regarding the commercial, sport, and Indian salmon fisheries in those waters because it does not take into consideration the escapement figures on the Eel River and the Smith River.

(b) The department shall use present assessment methods to assess the salmon escapement count on the Eel River and the Smith River, as well as the Klamath River, systems, employing out-of-work fishermen, where possible, to do the counts with department personnel in supervisory capacities.  Those figures shall be used by the commission and the department in all reports, recommendations, and decisions concerning the establishment of the commercial and sportfishing seasons in the state waters and in all recommendations to the Pacific Fishery Management Council or other regulatory agencies.  This program shall be a priority for funding under the Fisheries Restoration Act of 1985 (Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 2760) added to Division 3 of the Fish and Game Code by Senate Bill No. 400 of the 1985–86 Regular Session).

(b) The California deserts region is also the ancestral homeland of numerous tribal communities. The region includes cultural, biological, and historical resources on sacred land that should be protected and preserved.

(c) The California deserts region is an important part of the state’s economy, with total direct travel spending in the California deserts region estimated in 2018 at seven billion six hundred million dollars ($7,600,000,000) and by supporting 73,000 jobs. Total government revenue generated by travel in the California deserts region for 2018 was six hundred nine million dollars ($609,000,000).

(d) The California deserts region’s popularity among California and international recreationists has more than doubled within the past five years. Visitation to Joshua Tree National Park increased by 112 percent between 2013 and 2018. During the same time period, visits to Death Valley National Park increased by 76 percent and visits to Mojave National Preserve increased by 43 percent.

(e) The California deserts region provides world-class opportunities for hiking, camping, sightseeing, rock climbing, rock hounding, off-highway vehicle use, and many other recreational activities.

(f) Undisturbed desert lands are known to sequester and store carbon and contribute to climate change resilience.

(g) Nonnative, invasive grasses, such as Mediterranean grass and cheatgrass, create continuous fuel beds across desert lands that can spark and support massive wildfires in areas where fire was previously rare.

(h) The California deserts region is characterized as having high biological diversity. In the Mojave Desert, there is an approximate total of 1,500 plant taxa with 210 being endemic to California.

(i) The California deserts region is home to iconic species such as the western Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia), the federally threatened desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), and species of special concern such as the desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni), which requires wildlife corridors to maintain healthy populations.

(j) Water sources within the California deserts region are comprised of both groundwater and surface water that provide critical sustenance for unique and diverse ecosystems. Groundwater elevations should be stable and not overdrafted to maintain the surface flow of springs that support the fragile ecosystems in the region. Proposed groundwater extraction projects have threatened water supplies in the California deserts region.

#### CHAPTER 7.8. Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Wetlands Mitigation Bank Act of 1993 [1775 - 1796]  


##### ARTICLE 1. General Provisions [1775 - 1779.5]  

######### 1775.  
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Wetlands Mitigation Bank Act of 1993.



######### 1776.  
The Legislature finds and declares the following:

(a) Wetlands are an important natural resource of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley because they provide significant habitat for migratory waterfowl of the Pacific flyway, for endangered species, and for many other resident wildlife and fish populations.  Wetlands provide additional public benefits, including water quality improvement, flood protection, stream bank stabilization, recreation, and scientific research.

(b) Active and voluntary involvement by private landowners is necessary for the long-term availability and productivity of wetlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley.

(c) Large wetland preserves in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley, under certain circumstances, can provide an environmentally preferable alternative to a number of small, isolated wetland preserves of the same type surrounded by urban development.

(d) It is the policy of the state with respect to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley:

(1) To provide for the protection, preservation, restoration, enhancement, and expansion of the wetland habitat in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley.

(2) To promote the protection, preservation, restoration, enhancement, and expansion of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley wetlands in concert with other federal, state, and local programs, and interested parties.

(3) To improve cooperative efforts among private, nonprofit, and public entities for the management and protection of wetlands.

(4) To assure that no net loss of either wetland acreage or habitat values results from activities pursuant to this chapter in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley that otherwise comply with state and federal law.

(5) To encourage and maintain a predictable, efficient, and timely regulatory framework for environmentally acceptable development.

(6) To assure that the construction or maintenance of wetland mitigation banks in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley does not reduce any local tax base, does not create any uncompensated increased requirement for local services, and does not create conditions that have the potential to adversely affect the public health.

(7) To provide an alternative for accomplishing offsite mitigation in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley when offsite mitigation is required under a fill permit issued pursuant to Section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1344  et seq.).

(e) This chapter constitutes a nonexclusive alternative to other lawful methods of mitigating project impacts upon wetlands and maintaining and increasing wetlands acreage and habitat values generally.  Specifically, this chapter is not intended to, and shall not be interpreted to:

(1) Condone or encourage the removal, loss, or degradation of wetlands.

(2) Condone or encourage the removal, loss, or degradation of habitat for any rare, threatened, or endangered species.

(3) Abrogate any other local, state, or federal law or policy relating to wetlands, nor prohibit any city or county from prohibiting the removal, filling, or other destruction of particular wetlands.

(4) Establish maximum or minimum standards or any other requirements for wetland fill or mitigation, except for mitigation banks established pursuant to this chapter.

(5) Have legal or necessary precedential application to any other area of the state, or to other lands, resources, situations, or circumstances.

(6) Preclude other forms of mitigation banking, including private or for-profit programs, within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley.

(7) Be the exclusive method of providing compensation by permittees for the loss of wetlands within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley.

##### ARTICLE 2. Legislative Goals [1780 - 1781]  

######### 1780.  
The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that no net loss of wetland acreage or habitat values within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley occurs as a result of fill permit activities pursuant to Section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1344 et seq.).



######### 1781.  
It is the state’s goal to increase the total wetlands acreage and values within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley.








##### ARTICLE 3. Wetlands Mitigation Banks [1784 - 1787]  

######### 1784.  
(a) The department, in cooperation with those agencies specified in Section 1786, shall adopt regulations that establish standards and criteria for the bank site qualification process, for the evaluation of wetland habitat acreage and values created at the bank sites, and for the operation and evaluation of bank sites, and any other regulations that are necessary to implement this chapter.

These criteria shall require, at a minimum, that the newly created wetland provide the hydrologic, vegetative, and wildlife characteristics, including the food web components, of a naturally occurring wetland system that is equal to the site being mitigated.

(b) With respect to bank site standards and operator qualifications, the department shall consider, at a minimum, all of the following criteria:

(1) A requirement that the bank site have a reliable, adequate, and available water supply necessary to provide wetland values.  For wetlands dependent only on rainfall, rainfall satisfies this requirement.

(2) The relative ease or difficulty of converting uplands into wetlands at the bank site.

(3) The anticipated maintenance necessary to sustain the recreated and created wetlands at the bank site.

(4) The proximity of the bank site to other established preserves or natural features historically associated with abundant wildlife values.

(5) The proximity of the bank site to urban or populated areas that could reduce the bank site’s long-term biological values.

(6) The demonstrated ability of the bank site operator to create, administer, maintain, and protect the bank site in perpetuity in its enhanced state, including financial, technical, and management ability.

(7) The relative abundance or scarcity of the wetland type to be created at the bank site.

(c) A bank site or mitigation bank site may include any lands on which rice is grown as long as those lands are managed as ricelands with the required enhanced wetland values if they otherwise qualify under this chapter and either of the following conditions exist:

(1) The lands are lands on which rice was grown after January 1, 1996. For purposes of this paragraph, to qualify as new wetland values, rice shall not have been grown on the lands for 10 years before the application is submitted pursuant to Section 1785.

(2) The lands are lands on which rice was grown before January 1, 1996. These lands shall qualify only if there is an increase in wetland habitat value that is equal to the site being mitigated.  For purposes of this paragraph, a wetland value shall only be provided for lands on which rice was grown that are proposed for wetlands mitigation for the period when that land is flooded between the harvesting of rice and the planting of the next crop. This paragraph shall apply only to lands that were not flooded after harvest between January 1, 1982, and January 1, 1992.

(d) Any mitigation site established pursuant to subdivision (c) may be replaced by a new site of an equal wetland value.

(e) This section shall not be construed to permit waters used to flood rice fields in order to create wetlands mitigation to be credited as beneficial to wildlife under federal law.



######### 1785.  
If any person desires to establish a wetlands mitigation bank site under this chapter, the person shall apply to the department for a determination that the bank site and the operator qualify under the criteria established by the department pursuant to this chapter. The determination that a bank site qualifies under this chapter is a project for purposes of Section 21065 of the Public Resources Code.



######### 1786.  
(a) Before any wetlands are created on the bank site qualified pursuant to Section 1785, the department shall coordinate and shall be a signatory to a memorandum of understanding with the operator.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Fish and Wildlife Service of the United States Department of the Interior, the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board, and the State Department of Health Services or its designee, or any of them, may be signatories by indicating to the department their interest in participating within 90 days of being notified by the department of the department’s intent to initiate the procedures described in this section.  Any county located in whole or in part in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley may, by ordinance, require that it be a signatory to any memorandum of understanding for a bank site to be established within its boundary.

(b) The memorandum of understanding shall include, but is not limited to, all of the following items:

(1) Identification of the mitigation bank site, including the legal property description, acreage, types, and location of existing wetlands within the boundaries of the bank site.

(2) An agreement, by each of the governmental agencies in subdivision (a), that all new, successfully created wetland acreage shall qualify to be credited against the approved removal or fill of wetlands located in the qualifying urban area and within 40 miles of the bank site and is consistent with the procedures set out in this chapter.

(3) An agreement by the operator to do both of the following:

(A) Maintain all wetland habitat within the bank in optimum condition in perpetuity, barring an unforeseen natural catastrophe that precludes the viability of wetlands.

(B) Establish a trust or bond in favor of the department that provides sufficient funds to ensure administration, protection, operation, and maintenance in perpetuity of the wetland habitat acreage and values at the mitigation bank site if the operator defaults in performing the duties required pursuant to subparagraph (A).

(4) In the case of privately owned bank sites, identification of the circumstances that would constitute a major breach of the agreement and that would result in either the replacement of the operator, or the passing of title from the owner to the state, or both, including identification of procedures for adequate notice and opportunity for the operator to be heard and to correct any breach.



######### 1787.  
(a) If the bank site owner is a public entity, that entity shall pay annually to the county in which the property is located an amount equal to the county taxes levied on the property at the time title to the bank site is transferred to that entity.  The public entity shall also pay the assessments levied upon the property by any irrigation, drainage, or reclamation district.

(b) Payments under this section shall be made on or before December 10 of each year, except for newly acquired bank sites, for which payments shall be made pursuant to subdivision (c).

(c) Payments for newly acquired bank sites shall be made within one year of the date title to the property was transferred to the state, prorated for the balance of the year from the date title was transferred to the 30th day of June following the date title was transferred, and, thereafter, payments shall be made on or before December 10 of each year.








##### ARTICLE 4. Wetlands [1790 - 1792.5]  

######### 1790.  
Upon the successful creation of any wetlands of at least 20 acres, or in the case of vernal pools, upon successful creation of vernal pools on a site at least 20 acres in size, the operator may request a determination by the department of the number of acres in the mitigation bank site, and the relative habitat value thereof, that qualify for credit against prospective wetland loss in the qualifying urban area. In determining the amount of mitigation bank credit, no credit shall be provided for habitat values or acreage that was in existence prior to the establishment of the bank.



######### 1791.  
(a) Upon receipt of a request pursuant to Section 1790, the department shall determine the number of acres which are wetlands in the bank site based on the criteria established pursuant to Section 1784, and the department shall classify those wetlands according to established biological criteria.

(b) The classifications shall include, but are not limited to, the following wetland types:

(1) Perennial freshwater marsh.

(2) Perennial brackish marsh.

(3) Seasonal freshwater marsh.

(4) Wet meadow.

(5) Vernal pool.

(6) Riparian woodland.

(7) Riparian scrub.



######### 1792.  
In the interest of assuring that the minimum price for wetland credit is sufficient to ensure the financial integrity of the bank, the department may establish a minimum price for each bank established pursuant to this chapter. The operator may set a higher price to the extent that price is consistent with the terms of the memorandum of understanding executed pursuant to Section 1785. After the department determines the number of wetland acres in the bank site that qualify for credit against wetland loss in a qualifying urban area, the operator shall provide to the department, and the department shall verify, an accounting of the average cost for each wetland acre created, by wetland type for the purpose of determining credits, using the following factors:

(a) Land costs, including the reasonable interest cost of holding the land.

(b) Wetland creation costs.

(c) Wetland administration, maintenance, and protection costs.

(d) Annual taxes, including all tax increases allowed under applicable state law, and in-lieu payments pursuant to Section 1787, if applicable.

(e) Costs incurred by the department in establishing the bank site, and the direct cost of necessary ongoing monitoring and oversight.

(f) Any other information relevant to a determination of the cost of preserving the wetlands in perpetuity.



######### 1792.5.  
The department shall be reimbursed for those expenses of the department identified in Section 1792 according to a schedule contained in an agreement with the person establishing a wetland mitigation bank. The agreement shall be approved by all parties prior to the commencement of planning activities.








##### ARTICLE 5. Discharge into Wetlands [1793 - 1796]  

######### 1793.  
A permittee shall provide compensation pursuant to Section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1344 et seq.). The department shall classify the wetlands that the permittee will remove according to wetland type, consistent with Article 4 (commencing with Section 1790).



######### 1794.  
Compensation pursuant to Section 1793 is subject to the condition that the operator establish the trust or bond required by subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 1786 and, in addition, is subject to the following conditions:

(a) The full payment shall be used to purchase credits in the mitigation bank site.

(b) The payment shall provide for purchase of bank site wetland acreage required by Section 1793 that has the same hydrologic, vegetative, and other characteristics as the system for which it will serve as mitigation.

(c) A permittee shall not participate in a wetlands mitigation bank if a net loss of wetland habitat values or acreage occurs.



######### 1795.  
After payment to the operator pursuant to this article, the permittee has no further obligations with respect to the operation of the bank site to which payment was made, unless the permittee has an equity involvement in the bank.



######### 1796.  
No bank site shall be qualified under Section 1785 on or after January 1, 2015.







##### CHAPTER 7.9. Conservation Bank and Mitigation Bank Applications and Fees [1797 - 1799.1]  

######### 1797.  
The Legislature finds and declares as follows:

(a) Mitigation banks and conservation banks provide for the conservation of important habitats and habitat linkages, take advantage of economies of scale that are often not available to individualized mitigation projects, and simplify the state regulatory compliance process while achieving conservation goals.

(b) The department authorizes the establishment of private and public conservation and mitigation banks that can provide viable consolidated mitigation for adverse impacts caused by projects. Banks sell habitat or species credits to project proponents having mitigation responsibilities that require compensation for impacts to wetlands, threatened or endangered species, and other sensitive resources. The state policy on conservation banks was established in 1995 by the Natural Resources Agency and the California Environmental Protection Agency.

(c) In 2011, the department and other state and federal agencies, including the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, renewed a memorandum of understanding for the purpose of jointly establishing a framework for developing and using combined or coordinated approaches to mitigation and conservation banking in the state. The memorandum of understanding includes provisions for the development and continuous improvement of standardized banking program documents and guidance. Existing standardized documents identified in the memorandum of understanding include bank enabling instruments, conservation easements, long-term management plans, and bank proposal review checklists, among others.

(d) The department has properly excluded from being eligible as mitigation and conservation banks those lands that are not suitable to become banks, for reasons that include that the lands do not support significant biological resources or are not biologically viable, are subject to potentially inconsistent uses, encumbrances, or requirements, or would not meet requirements of permits or authorizations that require mitigation.

(e) Greater transparency is desired to ensure that mitigation requirements of regulatory programs, permits, and authorizations are fully met when employing conservation and mitigation banks, and that the monitoring of banks to ensure long-term conservation of species and habitats is scientifically valid.

(f) The private and public mitigation and conservation banks and the private and public entities to which bank credits are sold should fully fund the administrative and regulatory costs of the department in providing banking program services, administration and oversight.

(g) The department has found that the establishment and use of conservation and mitigation banks may result in added ecological benefits and reduced administrative costs over the more traditional forms of smaller, single-purpose mitigation projects.

(h) It is the intent of the Legislature that banking and all other forms of mitigation for wildlife species comply with regulatory requirements, are based on the best available scientific information, can be implemented successfully, and have adequate funding to achieve mitigation measures and be monitored for compliance and effectiveness. The Legislature recognizes that mitigation and conservation banking is important to the state because banks provide regulatory efficiencies, environmental benefits, and economic advantages. Properly developed and monitored banks have demonstrated their value and efficacy and are important tools in mitigating impacts to resources and in conserving a wide range of habitat lands.

(b) The purpose of this chapter is to promote the voluntary conservation of natural resources, including biodiversity and ecological processes, and to enhance resiliency to climate change and other threats. In order to further this goal, it is the policy of the state to encourage voluntary mechanisms to conserve biological and other ecological resources and to identify conservation actions, including actions to promote resiliency to the impacts of climate change and other stressors to species and habitat.

(c) It is further the policy of the state to encourage voluntary mechanisms to identify and implement advance mitigation actions that do all of the following:

(1) Can be used to compensate for project impacts, including, but not limited to, infrastructure and renewable energy projects, more efficiently.

(2) Are effective ecologically.

(3) Will help to conserve regionally important biological and other ecological resources.

(d) In enacting this chapter, it is the intent of the Legislature to promote science-based conservation, including actions to promote resiliency to the impacts of climate change and other stressors. It is further the intent of the Legislature to create nonregulatory mechanisms to guide investments in conservation, infrastructure, and compensatory mitigation for impacts to natural resources, including impacts to threatened and endangered species, other sensitive species, natural communities, ecological processes, and connectivity.

(e) In enacting this chapter, it is not the intent of the Legislature to regulate the use of land, establish land use designations, or to affect, limit, or restrict the land use authority of any public agency.

(f) Further, in enacting this chapter, it is not the intent of the Legislature that an approved regional conservation investment strategy would be binding on independent public agency action within the strategy’s geographic scope.



######### 1851.

(j) The importance of wildlife corridors to assist in adapting to climate change has been recognized by such groups as the Western Governors’ Association, which unanimously approved a policy to protect wildlife migration corridors and crucial wildlife habitat in 2007. Individual local, state, and federal agencies have also adopted policies aimed at protecting wildlife corridors and habitat connectivity, in order to protect ecosystem health and biodiversity and to improve the resiliency of wildlife and their habitats to climate change. However, these efforts could be enhanced through establishment of a statewide policy to protect important wildlife corridors and habitat linkages where feasible and practicable.



######### 1930.5.  
(a) Contingent upon funding being provided by the Wildlife Conservation Board from moneys available pursuant to Section 75055 of the Public Resources Code, or from other appropriate bond funds, upon appropriation by the Legislature, the department shall investigate, study, and identify those areas in the state that are most essential as wildlife corridors and habitat linkages, as well as the impacts to those wildlife corridors from climate change, and shall prioritize vegetative data development in these areas.

(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that the Wildlife Conservation Board use various funds to work with the department to complete a statewide analysis of wildlife corridors and connectivity to support conservation planning and climate change adaptation activities.

(c) (1) It is the policy of the state to promote the voluntary protection of wildlife corridors and habitat strongholds in order to enhance the resiliency of wildlife and their habitats to climate change, protect biodiversity, and allow for the migration and movement of species by providing connectivity between habitat lands. In order to further these goals, it is the policy of the state to encourage, wherever feasible and practicable, voluntary steps to protect the functioning of wildlife corridors through various means, as applicable and to the extent feasible and practicable, those means may include, but are not limited to:

 (A) Acquisition or protection of wildlife corridors as open space through conservation easements.

(B) Installing of wildlife-friendly or directional fencing.

(C) Siting of mitigation and conservation banks in areas that provide habitat connectivity for affected fish and wildlife resources.

(D) Provision of roadway undercrossings, overpasses, oversized culverts, or bridges to allow for fish passage and the movement of wildlife between habitat areas.

(2) The fact that a project applicant does not take voluntary steps to protect the functioning of a wildlife corridor prior to initiating the application process for a project shall not be grounds for denying a permit or requiring additional mitigation beyond what would be required to mitigate project impacts under other applicable laws, including, but not limited to, the California Endangered Species Act (Chapter 1.5 (commencing with Section 2050) of Division 3) and the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code).

(d) The Legislature finds and declares that there are a number of existing efforts, including, but not limited to, efforts involving working landscapes, that are already working to achieve the policy described in subdivision (c).

(e) Subdivision (c) shall not be construed to create new regulatory requirements or modify the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (E) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 2820 of the Fish and Game Code, or the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code).

(2) “Wildlife corridor” means a habitat linkage that joins two or more areas of wildlife habitat, allowing for fish passage or the movement of wildlife from one area to another.



######### 1931.  
The Legislature further finds and declares that it is the policy of this state to encourage the cooperation of federal, state, local, and private sectors, including private organizations and individuals, in efforts to maintain the state’s most significant natural areas.



######### 1932.  
There is hereby established the Significant Natural Areas Program which shall be administered by the department. The department, in administering this program, shall do all of the following:

(a) Obtain access to the most recent information with respect to natural resources. In order to accomplish this, the department shall maintain, expand, and keep current a data management system, designated the California Natural Diversity Data Base, designed to document information on these resources. That data shall be made available to interested parties on request.

(b) Develop and maintain a spatial data system that identifies those areas in the state that are most essential for maintaining habitat connectivity, including wildlife corridors and habitat linkages. This data should include information essential for evaluating the needs of wildlife species, as defined in Section 89.5, that require habitat connectivity for their long-term conservation, including distribution and movement patterns.

(c) As appropriate, develop and maintain the database by incorporating mapping products and data developed by other state agencies.

(d) Make all of the data sets, and associated analytical products, available to the public and other government entities.

(e) Ensure cost sharing by all who use the data management system and develop an appropriate schedule of compensation to be paid by individuals using the data management system, not to exceed the actual costs for use of the data management system.

(f) Ensure recognition of the state’s most significant natural areas, including those affected by climate change. The department shall, after consultation with federal, state, and local agencies, education institutions, civic and public interest organizations, private organizations, landowners, and other private individuals, identify by means of periodic reports those natural areas deemed to be most significant.

##### CHAPTER 13. Nonvehicular Wildlife Crossings [1950- 1950.]  

######### 1950.  
(a) For purposes of this chapter, “nonvehicular wildlife crossing” means a structure that allows animals to cross human-made barriers safely and includes, but is not limited to, underpasses, tunnels, viaducts, overpasses, amphibian tunnels, fish ladders, and culverts. Nonvehicular wildlife crossings are primarily habitat conservation and biodiversity projects, but also assist in avoiding collisions between vehicles and animals.

(b) The Wildlife Conservation Board may name a nonvehicular wildlife crossing if at least 25 percent of the funding to construct the crossing derives from a state source.

(c) The Wildlife Conservation Board shall consult with the Department of Transportation or other appropriate entities on the design of lettering and placement of any sign that displays the name of a nonvehicular wildlife crossing.

(d) The Wildlife Conservation Board may adopt criteria for the implementation of this section.







##### CHAPTER 13.5. Wildlife Connectivity Actions [1955 - 1958]  

######### 1955.  
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) California’s climate is changing. Rising temperatures, increases in the frequency and severity of extreme events like drought and wildfire, changing ocean conditions, and shifts in precipitation patterns all pose threats to California’s wildlife. These changes are shifting the habitat ranges of many California species, requiring these species to migrate to different latitudes or altitudes to locate suitable habitat necessary to survive.

(b) Land use is also changing as the state’s population continues to grow. Habitat conversion and fragmentation forces many California species to migrate in search of replacement habitat, and it also risks continued survival of species by compromising genetic diversity, among other things.

(c) California wildlife is losing the ability to move and migrate as habitat conversion and built infrastructure disrupt species habitat and cut off migration corridors.

(d) Habitat connectivity and wildlife migratory corridors are essential to the continued survival of many California species. Their importance will only grow as California wildlife increasingly migrates in response to climate change and resulting shifts in habitat suitability.

(e) Habitat connectivity is also necessary to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions, which put people and wildlife at risk of injury or death.

(f) The department has several existing programs that can be used to promote habitat connectivity. It is the intent of the Legislature to expand, or clarify, two of these programs, Chapter 7.9 (commencing with Section 1797) and Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 1850), to facilitate creation and issuance of mitigation credits for actions that improve wildlife connectivity.



######### 1956.  
For purposes of this chapter, the following terms apply:

(a) “Compensatory mitigation credit” means a credit that may be used to fulfill, in whole or in part, mitigation requirements under applicable federal, state, or local law.

(b) “Long-term durability” means doing both of the following:

(1) Providing a plan, approved in writing by the department, that ensures the long-term success, maintenance, repair, and upkeep of a wildlife connectivity action. If the wildlife connectivity action is used to create one or more mitigation credits pursuant to this chapter, the plan shall ensure the wildlife connectivity action remains in effect until, at minimum, the site of the environmental impacts is returned to preimpact ecological conditions.

(2) (A) Providing secure, long-term funding for implementation of the plan developed pursuant to paragraph (1) in a form approved in advance in writing by the department.

(B) For purposes of this section, transportation funding identified in the State Highway System Management Plan provides secure, long-term funding for a structure, but not the habitat thereon, on the state highway system.

(c) “Permanently protect” or “permanent protection” means doing both of the following:

(1) Recording a conservation easement, in a form approved in advance in writing by the department, or establishing perpetual protection of land in a manner consistent with draft or approved natural community conservation plans within the area of the applicable wildlife connectivity action and approved in writing by the department, that prevents development, prohibits inconsistent uses, and ensures habitat for focal species is maintained.

(2) Providing secure, perpetual funding for management of the land, monitoring, and legal enforcement, in a form approved in advance in writing by the department.

(d) “Wildlife connectivity action” means an action that measurably improves aquatic or terrestrial habitat connectivity, or wildlife migration, recolonization, and breeding opportunities inhibited by built infrastructure or habitat fragmentation. A wildlife connectivity action may include, but is not limited to, a road overpass or underpass solely for use by wildlife.



######### 1957.  
(a) The department may approve compensatory mitigation credits for wildlife connectivity actions taken under either of the following programs:

(1) Chapter 7.9 (commencing with Section 1797).

(2) Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 1850).

(b) (1) A wildlife connectivity action shall, if feasible, permanently protect all real property comprising the wildlife connectivity action or where the wildlife connectivity action is sited in order to receive compensatory mitigation credits pursuant to this chapter. The department may determine, on a case-by-case-basis, that permanent protection of all, or part of, the real property is infeasible. If the department determines that permanent protection of the real property is infeasible, in whole or in part, the department may still provide compensatory mitigation credits, including, but not limited to, compensatory mitigation credits for permanent impacts, for the wildlife connectivity action if the wildlife connectivity action meets both of the following conditions:

(A) Provides permanent protection of the real property where, and to the extent, feasible.

(B) Where, and to the extent, permanent protection is infeasible, the wildlife connectivity action has long-term durability.

(2) (A) In determining whether permanent protection is infeasible under this chapter, the department shall consider federal, state, and local legal restrictions, particularly those limiting the use of real property, that prevent, or significantly inhibit, placing a conservation easement on real property comprising the wildlife connectivity action or where the wildlife connectivity action is sited.

(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the department shall determine it is infeasible to permanently protect any portion of a wildlife connectivity action in the right-of-way of an existing state highway or other existing public road.

(c) In determining the value of compensatory mitigation credits for wildlife connectivity actions, the department may consider all of the following:

(1) The measurable improvement to habitat connectivity and wildlife migration, including, but not limited to, improving the ability of wildlife to safely cross or bypass built infrastructure, such as roads, that inhibit such connectivity or migration.

(2) The value of the habitat connected by the wildlife connectivity action.

(3) Benefits to affected species, including, but not limited to, improved genetic diversity and breeding opportunities, removed migration barriers, and improved access to additional latitudes and altitudes of potentially suitable habitat to adapt to climate change.

(4) Improved connectivity in critical terrestrial habitat linkages, including, but not limited to, the Santa Monica Mountains and Rim of the Valley Corridor, Santa Ana Mountains, San Gabriel Mountains, San Bernardino Mountains, Santa Cruz Mountains, and the Gabilan Mountain Range.

(5) The use or value of the particular location in improving connectivity and migration, including, but not limited to, topography, watercourse presence, vegetative cover, mortality data, or other factors that increase the likelihood of use, or value of, a particular location for connectivity or migration.

(6) Any other factor the department, in its discretion, deems relevant.

(d) When evaluating a proposed wildlife connectivity action under this chapter, the department may consult with the Department of Transportation, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. If a proposed wildlife connectivity action, or portion thereof, will be located on the right-of-way of an existing state highway, the department shall consult with the Department of Transportation in the course of its evaluation process.

(e) A compensatory mitigation credit created in accordance with this chapter may be used to fulfill, in whole or in part, compensatory mitigation requirements established under any state or federal environmental law, as determined by the applicable local, state, or federal regulatory agency, including, but not limited to, the following:

(1) To compensate for take or other adverse impacts of activities authorized pursuant to Chapter 1.5 (commencing with Section 2050) of Division 3.

(2) To reduce adverse impacts to fish or wildlife resources, or both, from activities authorized pursuant to Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 1600).

(3) To mitigate significant effects on the environment pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code) and Guidelines for Implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act (Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 15000) of Division 6 of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations).



######### 1958.  
The department may adopt guidelines and criteria to aid in the implementation of this chapter. Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code does not apply to the development, adoption, or amendment of guidelines or criteria pursuant to this section. These guidelines shall be posted on the department’s internet website.

######### 2050.  
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the California Endangered Species Act.



######### 2051.  
The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:

(a) Certain species of fish, wildlife, and plants have been rendered extinct as a consequence of man’s activities, untempered by adequate concern and conservation.

(b) Other species of fish, wildlife, and plants are in danger of, or threatened with, extinction because their habitats are threatened with destruction, adverse modification, or severe curtailment, or because of overexploitation, disease, predation, or other factors.

(c) These species of fish, wildlife, and plants are of ecological, educational, historical, recreational, esthetic, economic, and scientific value to the people of this state, and the conservation, protection, and enhancement of these species and their habitat is of statewide concern.



######### 2052.  
The Legislature further finds and declares that it is the policy of the state to conserve, protect, restore, and enhance any endangered species or any threatened species and its habitat and that it is the intent of the Legislature, consistent with conserving the species, to acquire lands for habitat for these species.



######### 2052.1.  
The Legislature further finds and declares that if any provision of this chapter requires a person to provide mitigation measures or alternatives to address a particular impact on a candidate species, threatened species, or endangered species, the measures or alternatives required shall be roughly proportional in extent to any impact on those species that is caused by that person.  Where various measures or alternatives are available to meet this obligation, the measures or alternatives required shall maintain the person’s objectives to the greatest extent possible consistent with this section.  All required measures or alternatives shall be capable of successful implementation.  This section governs the full extent of mitigation measures or alternatives that may be imposed on a person pursuant to this chapter. This section shall not affect the state’s obligations set forth in Section 2052.



######### 2053.  
(a) The Legislature further finds and declares that it is the policy of the state that public agencies should not approve projects as proposed which would jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat essential to the continued existence of those species, if there are reasonable and prudent alternatives available consistent with conserving the species or its habitat which would prevent jeopardy.

(b) Furthermore, it is the policy of this state and the intent of the Legislature that reasonable and prudent alternatives shall be developed by the department, together with the project proponent and the state lead agency, consistent with conserving the species, while at the same time maintaining the project purpose to the greatest extent possible.



######### 2054.  
The Legislature further finds and declares that, in the event specific economic, social, or other conditions make infeasible such alternatives, individual projects may be approved if appropriate mitigation and enhancement measures are provided.



######### 2055.  
The Legislature further finds and declares that it is the policy of this state that all state agencies, boards, and commissions shall seek to conserve endangered species and threatened species and shall utilize their authority in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.



######### 2056.  
The Legislature further finds and declares that the cooperation of the owners of land which is identified as habitat for endangered species and threatened species is essential for the conservation of those species and that it is the policy of this state to foster and encourage that cooperation in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter. Therefore, a landowner of property on which an endangered, threatened, or candidate species lives shall not be liable for civil damages for injury to employees of, or persons under contract with, the department if the injury occurs while those persons are conducting survey, management, or recovery efforts with respect to those species.



######### 2060.

######### 2065.  
“State lead agency” means the state agency, board, or commission which is a lead agency under the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Sec. 21000) of the Public Resources Code).



######### 2067.  
“Threatened species” means a native species or subspecies of a bird, mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, or plant that, although not presently threatened with extinction, is likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future in the absence of the special protection and management efforts required by this chapter. Any animal determined by the commission as “rare” on or before January 1, 1985, is a “threatened species.”



######### 2068.  
“Candidate species” means a native species or subspecies of a bird, mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, or plant that the commission has formally noticed as being under review by the department for addition to either the list of endangered species or the list of threatened species, or a species for which the commission has published a notice of proposed regulation to add the species to either list.

(2) The commission determines that it requires further information to evaluate whether the petition provides sufficient information to indicate that the petitioned action may be warranted. If the commission makes that determination during its deliberation, the commission may request, on the record at the scheduled meeting or at a continued meeting, further information on any issue relevant to making its determination as to whether the petition provides sufficient information to indicate that the petitioned action may be warranted. Any request by the commission pursuant to this paragraph shall specify a date by which the information must be submitted to the commission and shall serve to reopen the administrative record for the limited purpose of receiving further information relating to the issues specified by the commission in the request. Commission and department staff, the petitioner, or any other person may submit information in response to a request pursuant to this paragraph. If the commission reopens the record pursuant to this paragraph, it shall provide an opportunity for public comment on the submitted information prior to the issuance of its decision.

(d) In its discretion, the commission may either close the public hearing and continue the meeting on the petition for the purpose of deliberation or continue both the public hearing and the meeting on the petition to a subsequent date, which shall be no later than 90 days after the meeting scheduled pursuant to Section 2074, and subject to applicable notice and agenda requirements. If the commission closes the public hearing but continues the meeting for the purpose of deliberation, a person shall not submit, and the commission shall not receive, further information relating to the petition except as provided in subdivision (c).

(e) At the meeting scheduled pursuant to Section 2074 or at a continued meeting scheduled pursuant to subdivision (d), the commission shall consider the petition, the department’s written report, written comments received, and oral testimony provided during the public hearing, and the commission shall make and enter in its record one of the following findings:

(1) If the commission finds that the petition does not provide sufficient information to indicate that the petitioned action may be warranted, the commission shall publish a notice of finding that the petition is rejected, including the reasons why the petition is not sufficient.

(2) If the commission finds that the petition provides sufficient information to indicate that the petitioned action may be warranted, the commission shall publish a notice of finding that the petition is accepted for consideration. If the accepted petition recommends the addition of a species to either the list of endangered species or the list of threatened species, the commission shall include in the notice that the petitioned species is a candidate species. The commission shall maintain a list of species which are candidate species.

(f) The commission shall publish and distribute the findings relating to the petition pursuant to Section 2078.



######### 2074.4.  
If a petition is accepted by the commission for consideration, all reasonable attempts shall be made to notify affected and interested parties and to solicit data and comments on the petitioned action from as many persons as is practicable. In addition to commission efforts to provide notification through distribution of the commission agenda and minutes pursuant to Section 2078, the department shall immediately undertake efforts to notify affected and interested parties. Methods of notification may include, but are not limited to, correspondence, newspaper notices, and press releases, and notification shall include notice to owners of that land which may provide habitat essential to the continued existence of the species, unless the director determines that ownership is so widespread, fragmented, or complex as to make individual notice impractical.



######### 2074.6.  
The department shall promptly commence a review of the status of the species concerned in the petition. Within 12 months of the date of publication of a notice of acceptance of a petition for consideration pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 2074.2, the department shall produce and make publicly available on the department’s Internet Web site a final written peer reviewed report, based upon the best scientific information available to the department, which indicates whether the petitioned action is warranted, which includes a preliminary identification of the habitat that may be essential to the continued existence of the species, and which recommends management activities and other recommendations for recovery of the species. Prior to releasing the final written report, the department shall have a draft status review report prepared and independently peer reviewed, and upon receiving the peer reviewers’ input, shall evaluate and respond in writing to the independent peer review and shall amend the draft status review report as appropriate. The revised report shall be posted on the department’s Internet Web site for a minimum of 30 days for public review prior to the hearing scheduled pursuant to Section 2075. The commission may grant an extension of up to six months if the director determines an extension is necessary to complete independent peer review of the report, and to provide a minimum of 30 days for public review of the peer reviewed report prior to the public hearing specified in Section 2075.



######### 2074.8.  
This article does not impose any duty or obligation for, or otherwise require, the commission or the department to undertake independent studies or other assessments of any species when reviewing a petition and its attendant documents and comments.

The director may approve an extension of time for completion of the status report if necessary for the purposes of obtaining independent peer review pursuant to Section 2074.6.



######### 2075.  
The commission shall schedule the petition for final consideration at its next available meeting after receipt of the departmental report provided pursuant to Section 2074.6 and shall distribute the pending agenda for that meeting pursuant to Section 2078. The commission shall make the department’s report, or copies thereof, which was provided, pursuant to Section 2074.6, available for review upon request.



######### 2075.5.  
(a) At the meeting scheduled pursuant to Section 2075, the commission shall hold a public hearing on the petition and shall receive information, written or otherwise, and oral testimony. After the conclusion of oral testimony from the commission and department staff, the petitioner, or any other person, the commission may close the public hearing and the administrative record for the commission’s decision pursuant to this section.

(b) After the commission closes the public hearing, the administrative record for the commission’s decision is closed and it shall not be reopened except as provided in subdivision (c). Once the public hearing is closed, a person shall not submit further information to the commission for consideration on that petition and the commission shall not accept any further information for consideration on that petition except as provided in subdivision (c).

(c) The administrative record for the commission’s decision pursuant to this section shall not be reopened once the commission closes the public hearing unless one of the following occurs before the commission’s decision:

(1) There is a change in state or federal law or regulation that has a direct and significant impact on the commission’s determination as to whether the petitioned action is warranted.

(2) The commission determines that it requires further information to evaluate whether the petitioned action is warranted. If the commission makes that determination during its deliberation, the commission may request, on the record at the scheduled meeting or at a continued meeting, further information on any issue relevant to making its determination as to whether the petitioned action is warranted. Any request by the commission pursuant to this paragraph shall specify a date by which the information must be submitted to the commission and shall serve to reopen the administrative record for the limited purpose of receiving further information relating to the issues specified by the commission in the request. Commission and department staff, the petitioner, or any other person may submit information in response to a request pursuant to this paragraph.

(d) The commission, in its discretion, may either close the public hearing and continue the meeting on the petition for the purpose of deliberation or continue both the public hearing and the meeting on the petition to a subsequent date that is no later than 90 days after the meeting scheduled pursuant to Section 2075, and subject to applicable notice and agenda requirements. If the commission closes the public hearing but continues the meeting for the purpose of deliberation, a person shall not submit, and the commission shall not receive, further information relating to the petition except as provided in subdivision (c).

(e) At the meeting scheduled pursuant to Section 2075, or at a continued meeting scheduled pursuant to subdivision (d), the commission shall make one of the following findings based on the best available scientific information:

(1) The petitioned action is not warranted, in which case the finding shall be entered in the public records of the commission and the petitioned species shall be removed from the list of candidate species maintained pursuant to Section 2074.2.

(2) The petitioned action is warranted, or the petitioned action is not warranted but listing the petitioned species at a different status than that requested by the petitioner is warranted, in which case the commission shall, within 30 days of adopting written findings, publish a notice of that finding and shall add the species to, or remove the species from, the list of endangered species or the list of threatened species. Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code does not apply to the change in status of a species pursuant to this article. The commission shall submit the change in status to the Office of Administrative Law for filing with the Secretary of State and publication in the California Code of Regulations. The commission shall use underline or italics to indicate additions to, and strikeout to indicate deletions from, the California Code of Regulations to reflect the change in status.

######### 2080.2.  
The Legislature finds and declares the following:

(a) The historic settlement approved by Congress in the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act (Part I of Subtitle A of Title X of Public Law 111-11) directs the federal government to reintroduce spring run Chinook salmon to the San Joaquin River. In approving the settlement and the new statutory provisions governing the reintroduction of California central valley spring run Chinook salmon, Congress found that the implementation of the settlement, to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation regarding restoration of the San Joaquin River and the reintroduction of the salmon, was a unique and unprecedented circumstance. The settlement also provides that nothing in the settlement diminishes the statutory or regulatory protections under the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. Sec. 1531 et seq.) nor does it establish a precedent with respect to any other application of the federal act.

(b) Central valley spring run Chinook salmon have been listed since 1999 as a threatened species under this chapter and were still listed as of January 1, 2011.

(c) Restoring spring run Chinook salmon to the San Joaquin River is intended to further the conservation and recovery of the species.

(d) Consistent with the unique and historic circumstances that led to the settlement, nothing in Section 2080.2, 2080.3, or 2080.4 is intended to create any precedent as to future application of this chapter, nor do Sections 2080.2, 2080.3, or 2080.4 otherwise modify other existing statutes or legal obligations.

(e) The director shall publish the determination, pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), and subdivision (d), in the General Public Interest section of the California Regulatory Notice Register.



######### 2080.7.  
It is the intent of the Legislature that, before the introduction of an experimental population, as defined in Section 2080.6, onto land or into waters of this state, the department should undertake appropriate public outreach, including public meetings, in an effort to inform the public about the proposed introduction of the experimental population and its potential effects, if any, on ongoing human activities. To the extent practicable, this public outreach should include inviting other public boards, departments, or agencies that may have a regulatory or other role regarding the experimental population to collaborate with the department. Nothing in this section shall be construed to modify any other law or legal obligation.



######### 2081.  
The department may authorize acts that are otherwise prohibited pursuant to Section 2080, as follows:

(a) Through permits or memorandums of understanding, the department may authorize individuals, public agencies, universities, zoological gardens, and scientific or educational institutions, to import, export, take, or possess any endangered species, threatened species, or candidate species for scientific, educational, or management purposes.

(b) The department may authorize, by permit, the take of endangered species, threatened species, and candidate species if all of the following conditions are met:

(1) The take is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity.

(2) The impacts of the authorized take shall be minimized and fully mitigated. The measures required to meet this obligation shall be roughly proportional in extent to the impact of the authorized taking on the species. Where various measures are available to meet this obligation, the measures required shall maintain the applicant’s objectives to the greatest extent possible. All required measures shall be capable of successful implementation. For purposes of this section only, impacts of taking include all impacts on the species that result from any act that would cause the proposed taking.

(3) The applicant shall ensure adequate funding to implement the measures required by paragraph (2), and for monitoring compliance with, and effectiveness of, those measures.

(c) No permit may be issued pursuant to subdivision (b) if issuance of the permit would jeopardize the continued existence of the species. The department shall make this determination based on the best scientific and other information that is reasonably available, and shall include consideration of the species’ capability to survive and reproduce, and any adverse impacts of the taking on those abilities in light of (1) known population trends; (2) known threats to the species; and (3) reasonably foreseeable impacts on the species from other related projects and activities.

(d) The department shall adopt regulations to aid in the implementation of subdivision (b) and the requirements of Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code, with respect to authorization of take.

##### ARTICLE 3.7. California State Safe Harbor Agreement Program Act [2089.2 - 2089.25]  

######### 2089.2.  
(a) This article shall be known and may be cited as the California State Safe Harbor Agreement Program Act.

(b) The Legislature finds that a key to the goals set forth in this article of conserving, protecting, restoring, and enhancing endangered, threatened, and candidate species, is their habitat. A significant portion of the state’s current and potential habitat for these species exists on property owned by private citizens, municipalities, tribes, and other nonfederal entities. Conservation efforts on these lands and waters are critical to help these declining species. Using a collaborative stewardship approach to these lands and waters will help ensure the success of these efforts.

(c) The purpose of this article is to establish a program that will encourage landowners to manage their lands voluntarily to benefit endangered, threatened, or candidate species, or declining or vulnerable species, and not be subject to additional regulatory restrictions as a result of their conservation efforts.

(d) This article does not relieve landowners of any legal obligation with respect to endangered, threatened, or candidate species existing on their land. The program established by this article is designed to increase species populations, create new habitats, and enhance existing habitats. Although this increase may be temporary or long term, California state safe harbor agreements shall not reduce the existing populations of species present at the time the baseline is established by the department.



######### 2089.4.  
As used in this article, the following definitions apply:

(a) “Agreement” means a state safe harbor agreement approved by the department pursuant to this article. “Agreement” includes an agreement with an individual landowner and a programmatic agreement.

(b) “Baseline conditions” means the existing estimated population size, the extent and quality of habitat, or both population size and the extent and quality of habitat, for the species on the land to be enrolled in the agreement that sustain seasonal or permanent use by the covered species. Baseline conditions shall be determined by the department, in consultation with the applicant, and shall be based on the best available science and objective scientific methodologies. For purposes of establishing baseline conditions, a qualified person that is not employed by the department may conduct habitat surveys, if that person has appropriate species expertise and has been approved by the department.

(c) “Declining or vulnerable species” include candidate species, species proposed for listing as an endangered or threatened species pursuant to this chapter, or species that the department determines may, in the near future, be candidate species or proposed for listing as an endangered or threatened species pursuant to this chapter.

(d) “Department” means the Department of Fish and Wildlife, acting through its director or his or her designee.

(e) “Landowner” means any person or nonstate or federal entity or entities that lawfully hold any interest in land or water to which they are committing to implement the requirements of this article.

(f) “Management actions” means activities on the enrolled land or water that are reasonably expected by the department to provide a net benefit to the species or their habitat, or both.

(g) “Monitoring program” means a program established or approved by the department in accordance with subdivision (f) of Section 2089.6.

(h) “Net conservation benefit” means the cumulative benefits of the management activities identified in the agreement that provide for an increase in a species’ population or the enhancement, restoration, or maintenance of covered species’ suitable habitats within the enrolled property. Net conservation benefit shall take into account the length of the agreement, any offsetting adverse effects attributable to the incidental taking allowed by the agreement, and other mutually agreed upon factors. Net conservation benefits shall be sufficient to contribute either directly or indirectly to the recovery of the covered species. These benefits include, but are not limited to, reducing fragmentation and increasing the connectivity of habitats, maintaining or increasing populations, enhancing and restoring habitats, and buffering protected areas.

(i) “Programmatic agreement” means a state safe harbor agreement issued to a governmental or nongovernmental program administrator. The program administrator for a programmatic agreement shall work with landowners and the department to implement the agreement. The program administrator and the department shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of the agreement.

(j) “Qualified person” means a person with species expertise who has been approved by the department.

(k) “Return to baseline” means, at the termination of an agreement, activities undertaken by the landowner to return the species population or extent or quality of habitat to baseline, excluding catastrophic events such as floods, unplanned fires, or earthquakes, and other factors mutually agreed upon before permit issuance and that are beyond the control of the landowner.



######### 2089.5.  
(a) The department shall, to the maximum extent practicable, prioritize the review of, and decision to approve, an agreement if the property proposed to be enrolled in the agreement is encumbered by a conservation easement that requires a permanent commitment to protect, restore, and maintain habitat conditions, provided that the department finds that practices consistent with the conservation easement can reasonably be expected to provide a net conservation benefit to the species listed in the application.

(b) If the property proposed to be enrolled in an agreement is subject to a conservation easement, the department, to the maximum extent practicable, shall rely on the conservation easement to fulfill the requirements of Section 2089.8.

(c) This section only applies to agreements where a majority of the property is forestland.



######### 2089.6.  
(a) In addition to the other provisions of this article, the department may authorize acts that are or may become otherwise prohibited pursuant to Section 2000, 2080, or 2085 through an agreement, including a programmatic agreement, if all the following conditions are met:

(1) The department receives a complete application containing all of the information described in Section 2089.8.

(2) The take is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity.

(3) The department finds that the implementation of the agreement is reasonably expected to provide a net conservation benefit to the species listed in the application. This finding shall be based, at a minimum, upon the determination that the agreement is of sufficient duration and has appropriate assurances to realize these benefits.

(4) The take authorized by the agreement will not jeopardize the continued existence of the species. This determination shall be made based on the provisions of subdivision (c) of Section 2081.

(5) The department finds that the landowner has agreed, to the maximum extent practicable, to avoid or minimize any incidental take authorized in the agreement, including returning to baseline.

(6) The department has established or approved a monitoring program, based upon objective scientific methodologies, to provide information for the department to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the agreement program, including whether the net conservation benefits set forth in the agreement are being achieved and whether the participating landowner is implementing the provisions of the agreement.

(7) The department has determined that sufficient funding is ensured, for it or its contractors or agents, to determine baseline conditions on the property, and that there is sufficient funding for the landowner to carry out management actions and for monitoring for the duration of the agreement.

(8) Implementation of the agreement will not be in conflict with any existing department-approved conservation or recovery programs for the species covered by the agreement.

(b) If the species covered by an agreement is a declining or vulnerable species, and the species is subsequently listed as an endangered, threatened, or candidate species pursuant to this chapter, no further authorization or approval shall be required for take of the species in accordance with the agreement, regardless of the species’ change in status.



######### 2089.7.

#### CHAPTER 7.5. Wildlife and Natural Areas Conservation Program [2700 - 2729]  


##### ARTICLE 1. General Provisions [2700 - 2702]  

######### 2700.  
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Wildlife and Natural Areas Conservation Act.



######### 2701.  
(a) The fundamental requirement for healthy, vigorous populations of fish and wildlife is habitat. Without adequate habitat, efforts to conserve and manage fish and wildlife resources will have limited success. Further, California contains the greatest diversity of wildlife and plant species of virtually any state in the nation. This rich natural heritage enables Californians to enjoy a great variety of recreational, aesthetic, ecological, and other uses and benefits of these biological resources. The public interest is served only by ensuring that these resources are preserved, protected, and propagated for this and future generations.

(b) Many of California’s wildlife, fish, and plant species and biological communities are found nowhere else on earth. Without adequate protection and management, rare native species and communities could easily become extinct. In that event, the benefits they provide to the people of California, whether presently realized or which remain to be discovered, will be lost forever, and California will be significantly poorer as a result.

(c) The people of California have vested in the department the principal responsibility for protecting, conserving, and perpetuating native fish, plants, and wildlife, including endangered species and game animals, for their aesthetic, intrinsic, ecological, educational, and economic values. To help accomplish this goal, the people of California have further established a significant natural areas program and a natural diversity database in the department, which is charged with maintaining and perpetuating California’s most significant natural areas for present and future generations. To ensure the perpetuation of areas containing uncommon elements of natural diversity and to ensure the continued abundance of habitat for more common species, especially examples of those that are presently threatened with destruction, the purchase of land is often necessary.

(d) Accordingly, the purpose of this chapter is to provide the Wildlife Conservation Board and the department the financial means to correct the most severe deficiencies in wildlife habitat and in the statewide system of areas designated for the preservation of California’s natural diversity through a program of acquisition, enhancement, restoration, and protection of areas that are most in need of proper conservation.



######### 2702.  
As used in this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:

(a) “Acquisition” means the acquiring of any interest in real property.

(b) “Fund” means the Wildlife and Natural Areas Conservation Fund created pursuant to Section 2720.

(c) “Highly rare” means a worldwide rarity in which any species or natural community occurs in 50 or fewer locations, irrespective of whether the species or any species in the community is listed as threatened or endangered or was previously listed as rare.

(d) “Natural community” means a distinct, identifiable, and recurring association of plants and animals that are ecologically interrelated.

(e) “Species” means the fundamental biological unit of plant and animal classification that comprises a subdivision of a genus, but for the purposes of this chapter, “species” also includes the unit of a subspecies.








##### ARTICLE 2. Habitat Conservation Program [2720 - 2729]  

######### 2720.  
Moneys available for the purposes of this chapter pursuant to Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 5930) of Division 5.8 of the Public Resources Code shall be deposited in the Wildlife and Natural Areas Conservation Fund, which is hereby created. Money deposited in the fund shall be available for appropriation by the Legislature to the Wildlife Conservation Board, for expenditure pursuant to the Wildlife Conservation Law of 1947, for the following programs:

(a) Forty-one million dollars ($41,000,000) for the preservation of highly rare examples of the state’s natural diversity through the acquisition, enhancement, restoration, or protection, or a combination thereof, of lands supporting California’s unique, fragile, threatened, or endangered plants, animals, and natural communities.

(b) Six million dollars ($6,000,000) for the acquisition, enhancement, restoration, or protection, or a combination thereof, of critical habitat areas for fish, game mammals, and game birds, including, but not limited to, the following types:

(1) Winter deer ranges.

(2) Wild trout or steelhead nursery and spawning areas.

(3) Significant routes of migration for wildlife.

(4) Breeding, nesting, and forage areas for sage grouse and other upland game birds.

For purposes of this subdivision, “enhancement” includes the construction or development of facilities for furnishing public access to lands or waters open to the public for fishing, hunting, or shooting.

(c) Three million dollars ($3,000,000) for the acquisition, enhancement, restoration, or protection, or any combination thereof, of lands providing habitat for threatened, endangered, or fully protected species, such as the bald eagle, San Joaquin kit fox, desert tortoise, bighorn sheep, peregrine falcon, and California condor.



######### 2721.  
Funds available pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 2720 shall be expended to acquire, enhance, restore, or protect lands in California on which any of the following naturally exists:

(a) A unique species or natural community, whose existence at a single location in California is the only known occurrence in the world of that particular species or natural community.

(b) A species that occurs in only 20 or fewer locations in the world, at least one of which is in California.

(c) A natural community that occurs in only 50 or fewer locations in the world, at least one of which is in California.

(d) An assemblage of three or more highly rare species or natural communities, or any combination thereof, of which at least one of the species or natural communities is found only in 20 or fewer locations in the world.



######### 2722.  
(a) Whenever the application of the criteria specified in Section 2721 results in the identification of two or more parcels of land that are essentially indistinguishable as to their quality, preference shall be given to the parcel on which exists the species that is more threatened or more endangered.

(b) Whenever the application of the criteria specified in Section 2721 results in the identification of two or more parcels of land that are essentially indistinguishable as to their quality and the degree of threat to, or endangerment of, the species existing on them, preference shall be given to the parcel on which exists the best example of the species.  As used in this subdivision, “best example” means the parcel of land and the wildlife inhabiting it which, in balancing all the factors present, represents, as determined by the board, the stronger combination of all of the following:  the better condition, higher quality, easier defensibility, greater likelihood of long-term viability, and the lesser costs to be incurred by the department in operating and maintaining the parcel.



######### 2723.  
(a) Of the total amount available pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 2720, not more than five million dollars ($5,000,000) may be encumbered for any single acquisition project.  In enacting this limitation, the people of California recognize that there are a number of important projects meeting the criteria of this chapter but whose acquisition cost would most likely exceed this limitation.  Therefore, in these instances any acquisition cost in excess of this limitation may be met by a donation by the owner, donations of funds from private sources, or other funds from state or nonstate sources.

(b) The qualification for or allocation of a grant or grants to a local agency under Section 2720 shall not preclude eligibility for an additional allocation of grant funds to the same local agency pursuant to Section 2720 of this code or Section 5907 of the Public Resources Code.



######### 2724.

##### CHAPTER 8. Fisheries Restoration [2760 - 2765]  

######### 2760.  
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Keene-Nielsen Fisheries Restoration Act of 1985.



######### 2761.  
The Legislature finds and declares as follows:

(a) Many of California’s significant fish and wildlife resources in inland and coastal waters have declined as the result of many development projects which have provided valuable economic growth.

(b) Fish and wildlife have been adversely affected by water developments that have significantly altered water flows in many of California’s rivers and streams, thereby affecting fish and wildlife, their habitat, adjacent riparian habitat, spawning areas, and migration routes.

(c) Fish and wildlife are important public resources with significant economical, environmental, recreational, aesthetic, and educational values.

(d) California intends to make reasonable efforts to prevent further declines in fish and wildlife, to restore fish and wildlife to historic levels where possible, and to enhance fish and wildlife resources where possible.

(e) Protection of, and an increase in, the naturally spawning salmon and steelhead trout resources of the state would provide a valuable public resource to the residents, a large statewide economic benefit, and would, in addition, provide employment opportunities not otherwise available to the citizens of this state, particularly in rural areas of underemployment.

(f) The protection of, and increase in, the naturally spawning salmon and steelhead trout resources of the state should be accomplished primarily through the improvement of stream habitat.

(g) The Salmon, Steelhead Trout, and Anadromous Fisheries Program Act (Ch. 8 (commencing with Sec. 6900), Pt. 1, Div. 6), declares that it is the policy of the state to increase the state’s salmon and steelhead trout resources, and directs the department to develop a plan and program that strives to double the salmon and steelhead trout resources.



######### 2762.  
(a) The Fisheries Restoration Account is hereby created in the Fish and Game Preservation Fund.  The moneys in the Fisheries Restoration Account are hereby appropriated to the department for expenditure in fiscal years 1991–92 to 1993–94, inclusive, pursuant to subdivision (b).

(b)  The moneys in the Fisheries Restoration Account may be expended for the construction, operation, and administration of projects designated in the plan developed by the department in accordance with the Salmon, Steelhead Trout, and Anadromous Fisheries Program Act (Ch. 8 (commencing with Sec. 6900), Pt. 1, Div. 6), and projects designed to restore and maintain fishery resources and their habitat that have been damaged by past water diversions and projects and other development activities. Expenditures shall not be authorized for a project to be funded under this subdivision before a date which is 30 days after the department has furnished a copy of the proposal for the project to be funded, together with supporting descriptions, to the Joint Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture and to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee.  These projects shall have as their primary objective the restoration of fishery resources identified in the Salmon, Steelhead Trout, and Anadromous Fisheries Program Act.  Projects may include, but shall not be limited to, watershed assessments, fisheries restoration planning, acquisition of lands, restoration of habitat, restoration or creation of spawning areas, construction of fish screens or fish ladders, stream rehabilitation, and installation of pollution control facilities. Projects for restoration or creation of spawning areas shall utilize natural spawning rather than hatcheries to the extent possible.

Under no circumstances shall any water project be absolved under this subdivision of any mitigation requirements which are placed upon it under existing law.  

No land shall be acquired pursuant to this chapter by eminent domain proceedings.

(c) Priority for funding shall be given to projects that employ fishermen, fish processing workers, and others who are unemployed or underemployed due to the elimination of a commercial fishing season as a result of restrictions imposed by federal regulations.  This priority shall remain in effect only as long as those restrictions are in force.

(d) Expenditures shall not be authorized for multiyear projects funded under subdivision (b) before a date which is 30 days after the department has submitted an annual progress report on the project and a copy of the work schedule for subsequent year funding of the project to the Joint Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture and to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee.

(e) The department shall conduct a preproject and postproject evaluation on each project recommended in the plan and program developed by the department in accordance with the Salmon, Steelhead Trout, and Anadromous Fisheries Program Act for which money has been appropriated from the Fisheries Restoration Account.

(f) The department may expend not more than 5 percent of the funds annually appropriated from the Fisheries Restoration Account for the administration of projects.

(g) The department may contract for services for the purpose of conducting a preproject and postproject evaluation or for the administration of projects.

(h) The department shall, during the last fiscal year of funding, conduct a review of all previous and ongoing projects to determine if the elements of the plan and program developed by the department pursuant to the Salmon, Steelhead Trout, and Anadromous Fisheries Program Act are being met, including the goal of doubling the 1988 population of salmon and steelhead trout, as declared in Section 6902.



######### 2762.2.  
The department may advance partial finding, of up to 50 percent of the amount contracted for, to contractors for projects under subdivision (b) of Section 2762 if the director finds the organization meets all of the following requirements:

(1) It has a previously demonstrated record of successfully completing one or more fishery restoration projects funded under contract with the department.

(2) It utilizes generally accepted accounting procedures.

(3) It demonstrates that the project can be accomplished more efficiently and economically with partial funding advanced at the initiation of the project.



######### 2762.5.  
In addition to subdivision (b) of Section 2762, the moneys in the Fisheries Restoration Account may be expended, upon appropriation by the Legislature, by the department to fund the administrative costs of the Advisory Committee on Salmon and Steelhead Trout.



######### 2762.6.  
The department shall, after consultation with the Advisory Committee on Salmon and Steelhead Trout, allocate that amount of moneys appropriated to the department from the Public Resources Account in the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Surtax Fund which the department determines to be necessary to pay the costs for the advisory committee.



######### 2763.  
The director shall consult with the Resources Agency, the Department of Water Resources, the State Water Resources Control Board, the State Coastal Conservancy, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, and the California Coastal Commission in determining projects proposed for funding pursuant to Section 2762.



######### 2764.  
The director shall consult with other responsible state agencies and appropriate fishery advisory committees, including, but not limited to, the Advisory Committee on Salmon and Steelhead Trout and the Striped Bass Stamp Advisory Committee, in developing projects to be funded pursuant to Section 2762.



######### 2765.  
The California Water Commission, in any recommendation it may make to the Congress of the United States on funding for water projects, shall include recommendations for studies, programs, and facilities necessary to correct fish and wildlife problems caused, fully or partially, by federal water facilities and operation, including, but not limited to, all of the following:

(a) The Red Bluff Dam.

(b) The Trinity and Lewiston Dams.

(c) The facilities necessary to protect wildlife areas in the Suisun Marsh and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta from adverse water quality effects caused by the federal Central Valley Project.

#### CHAPTER 9. California Wildlife Protection Act of 1990 [2780 - 2799.6]  


##### ARTICLE 1. General Provisions [2780 - 2781]  

######### 2780.  
The people of California find and declare all of the following:

(a) Protection, enhancement, and restoration of wildlife habitat and fisheries are vital to maintaining the quality of life in California. As the state’s human population increases, there is an urgent need to protect the rapidly disappearing wildlife habitats that support California’s unique and varied wildlife resources.

(b) Much of the state’s most important deer winter ranges have been destroyed in the last 20 years.

(c) Critical winter ranges of migratory deer in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges are increasingly subject to incompatible land uses. In some counties, over 80 percent of the critical winter ranges fall on these lands. The potential for incompatible land uses on these lands is a major threat to the survival of many migratory deer herds.

(d) Deer, mountain lion, and other wildlife habitat within the Sierra Nevada, Cascade, Coast Range (including the Santa Lucia Mountains in Monterey County along the Central Coast), Siskiyou and Klamath Mountains; and the Santa Susana, Simi Hills, Santa Monica, San Gabriel, San Bernardino, San Jacinto, Santa Ana and other mountains and foothill areas within southern California, is disappearing rapidly. Small and often isolated wildlife populations are forced to depend upon these shrinking habitat areas within the heavily urbanizing areas of this state. Corridors of natural habitat must be preserved to maintain the genetic integrity of California’s wildlife.

(e) This chapter shall be implemented in the most expeditious manner. All state officials shall implement this chapter to the fullest extent of their authority in order to preserve, maintain, and enhance California’s diverse wildlife heritage and the habitats upon which it depends.



######### 2781.  
The people of California find and declare that wildlife and fisheries conservation is in the public interest and that it is necessary to keep certain lands in open space and natural condition to protect significant environmental values of wildlife and native plant habitat, riparian and wetland areas, native oak woodlands, and other open-space lands, and to provide opportunities for the people of California to appreciate and visit natural environments and enjoy California’s unique and varied fish and wildlife resources.

It is the intent of the people, in enacting this chapter, that additional funds are needed to protect fish, wildlife, and native plant resources and that the Legislature should provide those funds through bond acts and other appropriate sources.

It is the intent of the Legislature that nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to authorize a person to take wild pigs pursuant to this subdivision in violation of a state statute or regulation or a local zoning or other ordinance that is adopted pursuant to other provisions of law and that restricts the discharge of firearms.

(c) The department shall make a record of each report made pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) and may have an employee of the department investigate the taking or cause the taking to be investigated.  The person taking a wild pig shall provide information as deemed necessary by the department.  Upon completion of the investigation, the investigator may, upon a finding that the requirements of this section have been met with respect to the particular bear or wild pig taken under subdivision (a) or (b), issue a written statement to the person confirming that the requirements of this section have been met. The person who took the wild pig may transfer the carcass to another person without compensation.

######### 4181.2.  
For the purposes of this article relating to damage caused by wild pigs, “damage” means loss or harm resulting from injury to person or property.  The department shall develop statewide guidelines to aid in determining the damage caused by wild pigs.  The guidelines shall consider various uses of the land impacted by pigs.



######### 4181.5.  
(a) Any owner or tenant of land or property that is being damaged or destroyed or is in immediate danger of being damaged or destroyed by deer may apply to the department for a permit to kill those deer.

(b) The regulations of the commission shall include provisions concerning the type of weapons to be used to kill the deer. The weapons shall be those as will ensure humane killing, but the regulations of the commission shall provide for the use of a sufficient variety of weapons to permit the designation of particular types to be used in any particular locality commensurate with the need to protect persons and property. Firearms using .22-caliber rimfire cartridges may be used only when authorized by the director or his designee. No pistols shall be used. The caliber and type of weapon to be used by each permittee shall be specified in each permit by the issuing officer who shall take into consideration the location of the area, the necessity for clean kills, the safety factor, local firearms ordinances, and other factors that apply. Rifle ammunition used shall have expanding bullets; shotgun ammunition shall have only single slugs, or, if authorized by the department, 0 or 00 buckshot.

(c) The department shall issue tags similar to those provided for in Section 4331 at the same time the permit is issued. A permittee under this section shall carry the tags while hunting deer, and upon the killing of any deer, shall immediately fill out both parts of the tag and punch out clearly the date of the kill. One part of the tag shall be immediately attached to the antlers of antlered deer or to the ear of any other deer and kept attached until 10 days after the permit has expired. The other part of the tag shall be immediately sent to the department after it has been countersigned by any person authorized by Section 4341.

(d) A permit issued pursuant to this section may be renewed only after a finding by the department that further damage has occurred or will occur unless that permit is renewed. A person seeking renewal of the permit shall account for all prior tags issued at the time he or she received any prior permits, and if any tags are unused, he or she shall show either that any deer killed could not reasonably be tagged or why the killing was not accomplished within the allotted time and why that killing would be accomplished under a new time period.



######### 4185.  
In any district or part of a district within San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, bears may be taken at any time with traps within a good and substantial fence, as such fence is described in Section 17121 of the Food and Agricultural Code, surrounding beehives, if no part of the fence is at a distance greater than 50 yards from a beehive, and if a conspicuous sign is posted and maintained at each entrance to the enclosed premises to give warning of the presence of the traps. No iron or steel-jawed or any type of metal-jawed trap shall be used to take bear under this section.



######### 4186.  
Nothing in this code prohibits the owner or tenant of land, or any person authorized in writing by that owner or tenant, from taking cottontail or brush rabbits during any time of the year when damage to crops or forage is being experienced on that land. Any person other than the owner or tenant of the land shall have in possession when transporting rabbits from the property, written authority from the owner or tenant of land where those rabbits were taken. Rabbits taken under this section shall not be sold.



######### 4188.  
(a) If a landowner or tenant applies for a permit under Section 4181 for wild pigs or wild turkeys, or under Section 4181.5 for deer, the department shall notify the landowner or tenant about available options for allowing access by licensed hunters, including, but not limited to, access authorized pursuant to Article 3 (commencing with Section 1570) of Chapter 5 of Division 2 to control wild pigs, wild turkeys, and deer.

(b) The commission, in lieu of a permit as described in subdivision (a), and with the consent of, or upon the request of, the landowner or tenant, under appropriate regulations, may authorize the issuance of permits to persons holding valid hunting licenses to take wild pigs, wild turkeys, or deer in sufficient numbers to stop the damage or threatened damage.  Before issuing permits to licensed hunters, the department shall investigate and determine the number of permits necessary, the territory involved, the dates of the proposed hunt, the manner of issuing the permits, and the fee for the permit.



######### 4190.  
The department shall tag, brand, or otherwise identify in a persistent and distinctive manner any large depredatory mammal relocated by, or relocated with the approval of, the department for game management purposes.

(b) This section does not apply to a discharge or a release that is expressly authorized pursuant to, and in compliance with, the terms and conditions of a waste discharge requirement pursuant to Section 13263 of the Water Code or a waiver issued pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 13269 of the Water Code issued by the State Water Resources Control Board or a California regional water quality control board after a public hearing, or that is expressly authorized pursuant to, and in compliance with, the terms and conditions of a federal permit for which the State Water Resources Control Board or a California regional water quality control board has, after a public hearing, issued a water quality certification pursuant to Section 13160 of the Water Code. This section does not confer additional authority on the State Water Resources Control Board, a California regional water quality control board, or any other entity.

(c) It shall be an affirmative defense to a violation of this section if the defendant proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, all of the following:

(1) The defendant complied with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations requiring that the discharge or release be reported to a government agency.

(2) The substance or material did not enter the waters of the state or a storm drain that discharges into the waters of the state.

(3) The defendant took reasonable and appropriate measures to effectively mitigate the discharge or release in a timely manner.

(d) The affirmative defense in subdivision (c) does not apply and may not be raised in an action for civil penalties or injunctive relief pursuant to Section 5650.1, or in any other civil action that alleges a violation of this section resulting from unlicensed cannabis cultivation.

(e) The affirmative defense in subdivision (c) does not apply and may not be raised by any defendant who has on two prior occasions in the preceding five years, in any combination within the same county in which the case is prosecuted, either pleaded nolo contendere, been convicted of a violation of this section, or suffered a judgment for a violation of this section or Section 5650.1. This subdivision shall apply only to cases filed on or after January 1, 1997.

(f) The affirmative defense in subdivision (c) does not apply and may not be raised by the defendant in any case in which a district attorney, city attorney, or Attorney General alleges, and the court finds, that the defendant acted willfully.



######### 5650.1.  
(a) A person who violates Section 5650 is subject to a civil penalty of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) for each violation.

(b) The civil penalty imposed for each separate violation pursuant to this section is separate, and in addition to, any other civil penalty imposed for a separate violation pursuant to this section or any other provision of law, except as provided in subdivision (j).

(c) In determining the amount of a civil penalty imposed pursuant to this section, the court shall take into consideration all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the nature, circumstance, extent, and gravity of the violation. In making this determination, the court shall consider the degree of toxicity and volume of the discharge, the extent of harm caused by the violation, whether the effects of the violation may be reversed or mitigated, and with respect to the defendant, the ability to pay, the effect of any civil penalty on the ability to continue in business, any voluntary cleanup efforts undertaken, any prior history of violations, the gravity of the behavior, the economic benefit, if any, resulting from the violation, and any other matters the court determines justice may require.

######### 5901.  
Except as otherwise provided in this code, it is unlawful to construct or maintain in any stream in Districts 1, 1<font size="2"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>, 1<font size="2"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, 1<font size="2"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub>, 2, 2<font size="2"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, 2<font size="2"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, 2<font size="2"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, 3, 3<font size="2"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, 4, 4<font size="2"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>, 4<font size="2"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, 4<font size="2"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, 11, 12, 13, 23, and 25, any device or contrivance that prevents, impedes, or tends to prevent or impede, the passing of fish up and down stream.



######### 5902.  
In including the United States within the scope of this chapter the Legislature declares that it understands that the law and policy of the United States with respect to the development of water resources, the reclamation of land from flood and overflow, and in all other respects is to comply with state laws respecting water. The provisions of this chapter provide a procedure for the United States to comply with the provisions and policy of state law respecting its subject matter.



######### 5903.  
The United States shall file with the commission pursuant to this chapter a separate application for each dam it proposes to construct or enlarge if an owner other than the United States would be required to file an application pursuant to Division 3 of the Water Code in order to construct or enlarge the same dam. The application shall be on forms provided by the department.



######### 5904.  
The application of the United States shall give the following information:

(a) The name and address of the owner.

(f) The purpose for which the impounded or diverted water is to be used.

(g) Such other appropriate information as may be necessary in a given instance.

In instances wherein the physical conditions involved and the size of the dam are such as to render the above requirements as to drainage areas, rainfall, stream flow, and flood flow unnecessary, the commission may waive the requirements. 









##### ARTICLE 2. Dams and Obstructions [5930 - 5948]  

######### 5930.  
The department shall, from time to time, examine all dams in all rivers and streams in this State naturally frequented by fish.



######### 5931.  
If, in the opinion of the commission, there is not free passage for fish over or around any dam, the department shall cause plans to be furnished for a suitable fishway, and order in writing the owner of the dam to provide the dam, within a specified time, with a durable and efficient fishway, of such form and capacity and in such location as shall be determined by the department. Such fishway shall be completed by the owner of the dam to the satisfaction of the department within the time specified.



######### 5932.  
When all of the provisions of this article have been complied with, if in the opinion of the commission changed conditions make additional structures desirable for the free passage of fish, the department may make such additional structures and may expend such sums of money as it deems necessary for such additional construction, including the cost of insurance against any liability which the department may incur in connection with such structures.



######### 5933.  
Whenever an application for approval of plans and specifications for a new dam in any stream in this State, or for the enlargement of any dam in any such stream, is filed with the Department of Water Resources, pursuant to Part 1 (commencing with Section 6000) of Division 3 of the Water Code, a copy of such application shall be filed by the applicant with the commission. If then the commission deems that the construction of a fishway over such a dam is necessary for the preservation and protection of fish, and that construction and operation of such fishway is practicable, it shall set a date for a hearing to be held within 90 days after filing of such application with the commission.

At such hearing the applicant shall be entitled to introduce evidence to show that construction of the fishway is not necessary or is not practicable, taking into consideration the height of the dam and the amount of water available.

If, after the hearing, the commission finds that the construction of the fishway is necessary and practicable it shall, within five days after such hearing, notify the applicant to that effect.

After notice from the commission that a fishway is required, it shall be unlawful to commence the construction of any new dam or the enlargement of any dam without first obtaining the written approval of the commission of the design for such a fishway.



######### 5934.  
The commission or any party may, in any hearing, cause the deposition of witnesses to be taken in the manner prescribed by law for depositions in civil actions in the superior courts of this state under Title 4 (commencing with Section 2016.010) of Part 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure.



######### 5935.  
The owner of any dam upon which a fishway has been provided shall keep the fishway in repair and open and free from obstructions to the passage of fish at all times.



######### 5936.  
It is unlawful to wilfully destroy, injure, or obstruct any fishway.



######### 5937.  
The owner of any dam shall allow sufficient water at all times to pass through a fishway, or in the absence of a fishway, allow sufficient water to pass over, around or through the dam, to keep in good condition any fish that may be planted or exist below the dam. During the minimum flow of water in any river or stream, permission may be granted by the department to the owner of any dam to allow sufficient water to pass through a culvert, waste gate, or over or around the dam, to keep in good condition any fish that may be planted or exist below the dam, when, in the judgment of the department, it is impracticable or detrimental to the owner to pass the water through the fishway.



######### 5938.  
Whenever in the opinion of the commission it is impracticable, because of the height of any dam, or other conditions, to construct a fishway over or around the dam, the commission may, in lieu of the fishway, order the owner of the dam completely to equip, within a specified time, on a site to be selected by the department, a hatchery, together with dwellings for help, traps for the taking of fish, and all other equipment necessary to operate a hatchery station, according to plans and specifications furnished by the department. After such hatchery has been constructed, the department shall operate it without further expense to the owner of the dam except as provided in Sections 5940 and 5941.



######### 5939.  
The hatchery, traps, and other equipment necessary to operate a hatchery station shall not be of a size greater than necessary to supply the stream or river with a reasonable number of fish. The owner of the dam shall permit the department to locate the hatchery, dwellings, traps, and other equipment upon any of the land of the owner of the dam upon a site or sites to be mutually agreed upon by the department and the owner of the dam.



######### 5940.  
If the owner of the dam generates electricity at the place of the dam, he shall furnish sufficient light, without charge, for the use of the hatchery.



######### 5941.  
The owner shall permit the use of water, without charge, to operate the hatchery.



######### 5942.  
The commission may, in lieu of a fishway, hatchery, dwelling, traps or other equipment necessary to operate a hatchery station, order the owner of the dam to plant, under the supervision of the department, the young of such fish as naturally frequent the waters of the stream or river, at such times, in such places, and in such numbers as the commission may order.



######### 5943.  
(a) The owner of a dam shall accord to the public for the purpose of fishing, the right of access to the waters impounded by the dam during the open season for the taking of fish in the stream or river, subject to the regulations of the commission.

(b) Subdivision (a) does not apply to any impoundment of water by a dam that is wholly located on privately owned land that is primarily agricultural or residential in nature if the impounded waters are from a stream or river that is not naturally frequented by fish and if the dam does not prevent the free passage of fish over or around the dam. The Legislature finds and declares that this subdivision is intended to be declaratory of existing law.



######### 5944.  
The owner of a dam is not liable in damages to any person exercising the right to fish, who suffers any injury through coming in contact with, or tampering with, any of the property of the owner of the dam.



######### 5945.  
The department may sell, at cost, to the owner of a dam, young fish ordered to be planted.

Plans and specifications for any such dam shall not be approved by the Department of Water Resources unless adequate provision is made for full compliance with Section 5937.



######### 5947.  
It is unlawful for the owner of a dam in District 4<font size="2"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to release water from the dam, or any facilities for the generation of hydroelectric energy operated in connection therewith, in varying flows in such a manner as to destroy fish life below such release.



######### 5948.  
No person shall cause or having caused, permit to exist any log jam or debris accumulation or any other artificial barrier, except a dam for the storage or diversion of water, public bridges and approaches thereto, groins, jetties, seawalls, breakwaters, bulkheads, wharves and piers permitted by law, and debris from mining operations, in any stream in this State, which will prevent the passing of fish up and down stream or which is deleterious to fish as determined by the commission, subject to review by the courts.









##### ARTICLE 3. Conduits and Screens: Diversions Over 250 Cubic Feet per Second [5980 - 5993]  

######### 5980.  
This article shall apply only to conduits described in Section 5987, and conduits with a maximum flow capacity over 250 cubic feet per second of water.

In classifying conduits it is recognized that those involving the passage of water through power devices and those of large size tend to destroy fish in a greater degree than conduits of smaller size or different type.

If this section is for any reason held to be unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this article.

The Legislature hereby declares that the persons owning conduits referred to in this section shall be subject to the provisions of this article.



######### 5981.  
The department shall examine all conduits; and order the owner of a conduit to install, and it is the duty of such an owner to install, a screen on the conduit when, in the opinion of the department, a screen is necessary to prevent fish from passing into the conduit.

Except as provided in Sections 5987, 5988 and 5989, one-half of the expense of constructing or installing a screen shall be paid by the owner of a conduit and one-half by the department.

An order to install a screen shall be in writing, and shall specify the type, size, mesh, material and location of the screen, the time within which the screen shall be installed, and an estimate of the expense of installing the screen.



######### 5983.  
When an order is made to install a screen, the department shall pay the owner of the conduit upon whom the order is served one-half of the estimated expense of the construction or installation of the screen.



######### 5984.  
If the expense of constructing or installing a screen exceeds the estimated expense the department shall, upon written notification by the owner of the conduit, inspect the screen, and pay to the owner one-half of the amount estimated to be necessary to complete the construction or installation of the screen.



######### 5985.  
The owner of the conduit shall, within 10 days after completing the installation of the screen, return to the department any surplus money advanced by the department pursuant to this article.



######### 5986.  
All money paid by the department to the owner of a conduit pursuant to this article shall be paid out of the Fish and Game Preservation Fund.



######### 5987.  
The department shall not pay one-half of the expense of the construction and installation of any screen as provided in Sections 5981, 5983, and 5984 to any person engaged in producing, generating, transmitting, delivering, or furnishing electricity for light, heat or power.

If this section is for any reason held to be unconstitutional, the decision shall not affect the validity of Section 5981, 5983 or 5984, and the Legislature hereby declares that the persons mentioned in this section shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 5981, 5983 and 5984.



######### 5988.  
When a screen has been installed, the owner may, by written notice within 90 days after such installation, request the department to inspect the screen for the purpose of accepting it. Thereupon it is the duty of the department to inspect the screen, and if it has been installed in accordance with the order and plans and specifications agreed upon by the department and the owner as provided in Section 5992 or approved by the Department of Water Resources the department shall accept and approve the screen in writing. If, upon such inspection it appears that the screen has not been constructed and installed in accordance with such plans and specifications, the department shall, within 60 days after such inspection, notify the owner of any deviation from the order. Thereupon such deviation may be remedied within 90 days, and a further inspection requested.



######### 5989.  
After acceptance, should the screen fail to function in an efficient manner, no changes in conditions affecting its operation having occurred subsequent to the acceptance of the screen, the owner shall not be required to install a new screen. However, the department may install another screen at the sole cost and expense of the department of a type, size, mesh, and at a location agreed upon by the department and the owner, or approved by the Department of Water Resources, as provided in Section 5992 of this code.



######### 5990.  
It is unlawful for the owner of a conduit to refuse, fail, or neglect to install a screen in compliance with an order from the department or to permit the screen to be removed or taken out of place, except for repairs or cleaning while water is running in the conduit.



######### 5991.  
In lieu of the department’s ordering the owner to install a screen the department may, at its option, elect to construct and install the screen itself, in which event the type, size, mesh, and location of the screen and the time within which it shall be installed shall be determined as provided by Section 5992 of this code.

When the department elects to construct and install a screen, one-half of the cost of construction and installation shall be paid by the owner.

The department may pay the entire cost of the construction and installation of a screen from the Fish and Game Preservation Fund, in which case it shall, upon completion of the screen, notify the owner of the amount of one-half of the cost, and the owner shall, within 30 days thereafter, remit that amount to the department.



######### 5992.  
Any screen installed under any of the provisions of this article shall be reasonably adequate to prevent fish from passing into the conduit and not unnecessarily impede the flow of water or prevent the owner from diverting the amount of water he is legally entitled to divert.

The type, size, mesh, and location of the screen and the time within which it shall be installed shall be mutually agreed upon by the department and the owner of the conduit.  In the event the department and the owner of the conduit cannot agree upon the type, size, mesh, and location of the screen and the time within which it shall be installed, such matters shall be submitted for determination to the Department of Water Resources whose decision thereon shall be final and conclusive.

If the owner and the department fail to agree upon the type, size, mesh, location, and time of installation of the screen within 60 days from the first submission of proposed plans and specifications by the department to the owner, either the department or the owner may submit such matters, in writing to the Department of Water Resources for final and conclusive decision, and it shall, within 60 days from such reference, render its decision in writing determining such matters.

The department shall maintain and keep the screen in repair, and shall quarterly notify the owner in writing of the cost thereof, and the owner shall within 30 days thereafter remit to the department an amount equal to one-half of such cost.

The owner shall operate and keep free from debris any screen installed, and shall quarterly notify the department in writing of the cost thereof, and the department shall within 30 days thereafter remit to the owner an amount equal to one-half of such cost.



######### 5993.  
Before the installation of any screen under the provisions of this article, the department and the owner shall enter into an agreement defining the method of determining the cost of maintenance, repairs, operation, and keeping the screen free of debris, which agreement shall provide that in the event either the department or the owner objects to such cost the matter shall be referred to the Director of General Services for his final and conclusive decision.

######### 6020.  
This article shall apply only to conduits with a maximum flow capacity of 250 cubic feet per second or less of water, other than those conduits described in Section 5987.

If this section is for any reason held to be unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of Article 3 of this chapter and the Legislature hereby declares that the persons owning conduits referred to in this section shall be subject to the provisions of Article 3 of this chapter.



######### 6021.  
The department shall examine new or existing conduits, and may install, maintain, repair, and replace fish screens, bypasses, or other devices to prevent the passage of fish through a conduit, when in the opinion of the department such a screen or device is practical and necessary. The owner of a conduit shall grant to the department the right of access to the conduit for the installation and maintenance of the screen, and shall provide the department with an easement for a site for the installation of the screen or device deemed suitable by the department. The owner shall also supply sufficient water for a bypass to carry fish stopped by the screen or device back to the channel from which they were diverted, and an easement for the bypass channel, but such easement shall not require the acquisition or leasing of additional lands by the owner. No water for a bypass shall be required if the channel from which the water is diverted is dry or incapable of supporting fish life below the point of diversion.



######### 6022.  
Sufficient water for a bypass shall be not to exceed the following:

(a) Diversions under three cubic feet per second capacity shall not be required to bypass more than 18 gallons per minute.

(b) Diversions of three cubic feet per second or more, but under 10 cubic feet per second, shall not be required to bypass more than 30 gallons per minute.

(c) Diversions of 10 cubic feet per second or more, but under 20 cubic feet per second, shall not be required to bypass more than 40 gallons per minute.

(d) Diversions of 20 cubic feet per second or over shall not be required to bypass more than one-half of 1 percent of the capacity of the diversion.

(e) Diversions built by the Government of the United States and requiring bypasses longer than one-quarter mile shall bypass such amount of water as is necessary to return fish to the permanent channel satisfactorily.



######### 6023.  
The department shall serve written notice upon each owner of its intention to install a fish screen, and shall describe therein the distance downstream from the intake or in other manner the location of the screen, the access required, and the amount of water required for the bypass. The notice shall be served upon the owner in duplicate, and in such form that the original copy upon signature by the owner shall serve as an agreement to the installation of the screen or device under the terms therein, and shall require the owner to render such assistance, other than mechanical repair or replacement of parts, necessary to keep the screen or device in satisfactory operating condition. The hiring of additional labor shall not be required for such assistance.



######### 6024.  
If the owner fails to sign and return the agreement granting the department the necessary rights for the installation of the screen or device within 60 days after its service on him, the department may install the screen as though the agreement had been signed unless a decision of the Department of Water Resources is requested. In the event the department and the owner of the conduit cannot agree upon the type, size, mesh, or location of the screen or device, the amount of water required for a bypass, or the time within which the screen or device shall be installed, the matter shall be submitted for determination to the Department of Water Resources, whose decision thereon shall be final and conclusive. The Department of Water Resources shall render its decision within 60 days after either the department or the owner has submitted the matter in writing and requested a decision.



######### 6025.  
It is unlawful for the owner of a conduit to cause or permit a screen to be removed or taken out of place, except for repairs or cleaning, while water is running in the conduit, or to operate the conduit with the bypass closed when the screen is operating as provided in this article.



######### 6026.  
Any screen installed under this article shall be such as will be reasonably adequate to prevent fish from passing into the conduit and will not unnecessarily impede the flow of water or prevent the owner from diverting the amount of water he is legally entitled to divert.



######### 6027.  
This article does not prevent the department from removing or permitting an owner to remove a screen or close a bypass during any part of the year when the department finds that such action will not endanger fish life.



######### 6028.  
All money paid by the department to the owner of a conduit pursuant to this article shall be paid out of the Fish and Game Preservation Fund.









##### ARTICLE 5. Diversion of Water From Streams [6100- 6100.]  

######### 6100.  
 (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of Article 3 (commencing with Section 5980) and Article 4 (commencing with Section 6020), on or after January 1, 1972, any new diversion of water from any stream having populations of salmon and steelhead that is determined by the department to be deleterious to salmon and steelhead shall be screened by the owner. The construction, operation, or maintenance costs of any screen required pursuant to this article shall be borne by the owner of the diversion.

(b) The department within 30 days of providing written notice to the owner that the department has determined that the diversion is deleterious to salmon and steelhead pursuant to subdivision (a), or within the time determined by mutual written agreement, shall submit to the owner its proposals as to measures necessary to protect the salmon and steelhead. The department shall notify the owner that it shall make onsite investigation and shall make any other investigation before it shall propose any measures necessary to protect fishlife.

##### ARTICLE 2. Artificial Reefs [6420 - 6425]  

######### 6420.  
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) Declines in various southern California marine species of fish have adversely affected the sport and commercial fishing industry.

(b) Efforts to enhance these species through the placement of  artificial reefs need to be investigated.

(c) A program of artificial reef research and development, including reef design, placement, and monitoring, is in the public interest and can best be accomplished under the administration of the department with the cooperation and assistance of the University of California, the California State University, other established, appropriate academic institutions, and other organizations with demonstrated expertise in the field.

(d) A state artificial reef research and construction program under the administration of the department is necessary to coordinate ongoing studies and construction of artificial reefs in waters of the state.



######### 6421.  
For purposes of this article, the following terms have the following meaning:

(a) “Artificial reef” means manmade or natural objects intentionally placed in selected areas of the marine environment to duplicate those conditions that induce production of fish and invertebrates on natural reefs and rough bottoms, and that stimulate the growth of kelp or other midwater plant life which creates natural habitat for those species.

(b) “Production” means increases in the biomass of a species or number of species.

(c) “Program” means the California Artificial Reef Program.



######### 6422.  
The department shall administer the California Artificial Reef Program.



######### 6423.  
The program shall include all of the following:

(a) The placement of artificial reefs in state waters.

(b) A study of existing successful reefs and all new reefs placed by the program to determine the design criteria needed to construct artificial reefs capable of increasing fish and invertebrate production in waters of the state.

(c) A determination of the requirements for reef siting and placement.



######### 6424.

##### ARTICLE 4. Grass Carp [6440 - 6460]  

######### 6440.  
The Legislature finds and declares that triploid grass carp have the potential to control aquatic nuisance plants in non-public waters allowing for reduced chemical control but that the threat that grass carp pose to aquatic habitat may outweigh its benefits. It is the intent of this section to allow the department to use its management authority to provide for the long-term health of the ecosystem in the state, including the aquatic ecosystem, and, in that context, manage grass carp either through control of movement, eradication of populations, acquisition of habitat, and any other action that the department finds will maintain the biological diversity and the long term, overall health of the state’s environment. The department shall undertake the management of grass carp in a manner that is consistent with provisions of this code, and, for the purposes of this section, the department shall define management as handling, controlling, destroying, or moving species. The Legislature does not intend for this section to provide a right for the use of triploid grass carp if the department finds that use of the species poses an unacceptable risk to the state’s existing ecosystem.



######### 6450.  
The department shall adopt regulations that provide for the control of aquatic plant pests using artificially introduced triploid grass carp under a permit issued by the department.  The regulations shall do all of the following:

(a) Restrict triploid grass carp introductions to those triploid grass carp that have been rendered sterile immediately after the eggs have been fertilized.

(b) Require individual fish to be checked to ensure that a third, triploid, set of chromosomes has been retained, preventing further reproduction by that individual fish.

#### CHAPTER 5.5. California Marine Resources Legacy Act [6600 - 6621]  


##### ARTICLE 1. General Provisions [6600 - 6605]  

######### 6600.  
This act shall be known, and may be cited, as the California Marine Resources Legacy Act.



######### 6601.  
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) California’s extraordinary marine biological diversity is a vital asset to the state and nation. The diversity of species and ecosystems found in the ocean waters off the state is important to public health and well-being, ecological health, and ocean-dependent economic activities.

(b) Although the state maintains various programs to protect, restore, and enhance California’s marine resources, the effect of these programs is limited by inadequate and unstable funding.

(c) There is an existing permitting process for decommissioning and fully removing offshore oil platforms or production facilities. Owners and operators are currently responsible for the full cost of decommissioning and remediating those facilities.

(d) According to the United States Department of the Interior, the 23 oil and gas platforms in federal waters off the California coast are expected to reach the end of their useful production lifetimes and be decommissioned between 2015 and 2030.

(e) The California Ocean Science Trust in its June 2010 study, titled “Evaluating Alternatives for Decommissioning California’s Offshore Oil and Gas Platforms: A Technical Analysis to Inform State Policy,” analyzed a number of decommissioning alternatives to full rig removal and determined that the most likely alternative is to remove the upper portion of the rig and leave the remainder of the structure in place.

(f) The California Ocean Science Trust report and other studies indicate that the partial removal option can result in a net benefit to the marine environment and substantial cost savings compared to full removal of an oil platform or production facility.

(g) Provided that partial removal of an oil rig would result in a net benefit to the marine environment compared to full removal, it is in the interest of the state that a portion of the cost savings that result from partial removal should be shared with the citizens of this state to protect and enhance the state’s marine resources.

(h) It is also in the interest of the state that any program to allow partial removal of oil platforms meet all of the following criteria:

(1) Partial removal shall result in a net benefit to the marine environment compared to full removal.

(2) The determination of whether partial removal would result in a net benefit to the marine environment should be made only after scientific study and evaluation.

(3) Because the location and depth of an oil platform, as well as other ecological factors, create a unique environment, each oil platform shall be subject to scientific study and evaluation before partial removal is allowed.

(4) The costs of the scientific study and evaluation should be borne by the applicant.



######### 6602.  
For purposes of this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:

(a) “Applicant” means the owner or operator of an offshore oil structure in state or federal waters or another party responsible for decommissioning an offshore oil structure in state or federal waters who applies pursuant to this chapter to carry out partial removal of the structure.

(b) “Commission” means the State Lands Commission.

(c) “Conservancy” means the State Coastal Conservancy.

(h) “National Fishing Enhancement Act of 1984” means Title II of Public Law 98-623.

(i) “Offshore oil structure” means platforms, piers, and artificial islands located seaward of mean lower low water, used for oil and gas exploration, development, production, processing, or storage.

(j) “Oil” means any kind of petroleum, liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas, or petroleum products or any fraction or residues therefrom.

(k) “Open coastal marine resources” means those marine resources that use open coastal waters as their habitat.

(l) “Open coastal waters” means the area composed of the submerged lands of the state that are below the mean lower low water, extending seaward to the boundaries of the exclusive economic zone.

(m) “Partial removal” means an alternative to full removal of an offshore oil structure, in compliance with all requirements of this chapter.

(n) “State waters” means waters within the seaward boundary of the state as identified in Section 2 of Article III of the California Constitution.

#### CHAPTER 8. Salmon, Steelhead Trout, and Anadromous Fisheries Program Act [6900 - 6930]  


##### ARTICLE 1. Citation and Legislative Findings [6900 - 6903.5]  

######### 6900.  
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Salmon, Steelhead Trout, and Anadromous Fisheries Program Act.



######### 6901.  
The Legislature, for purposes of this chapter, finds as follows:

(a)  According to the department, the natural production of salmon and steelhead trout in California has declined to approximately 1,000,000 adult chinook or king salmon, 100,000 coho or silver salmon, and 150,000 steelhead trout.

(b) The naturally spawning salmon and steelhead trout resources of the state have declined dramatically within the past four decades, primarily as a result of lost stream habitat on many streams in the state.

(c) Much of the loss of salmon and steelhead trout and anadromous fish in the state has occurred in the central valley.

(d)  Protection of, and an increase in, the naturally spawning salmon and steelhead trout resources of the state would provide a valuable public resource to the residents, a large statewide economic benefit, and would, in addition, provide employment opportunities not otherwise available to the citizens of this state, particularly in rural areas of present underemployment.

(e) Proper salmon and steelhead trout resource management requires maintaining adequate levels of natural, as compared to hatchery, spawning and rearing.

(f) Reliance upon hatchery production of salmon and steelhead trout in California is at or near the maximum percentage that it should occupy in the mix of natural and artificial hatchery production in the state. Hatchery production may be an appropriate means of protecting and increasing salmon and steelhead in specific situations; however, when both are feasible alternatives, preference shall be given to natural production.

(g) The protection of, and increase in, the naturally spawning salmon and steelhead trout of the state must be accomplished primarily through the improvement of stream habitat.

(h) Funds provided by the Legislature since 1978 to further the protection and increase of the fisheries of the state have been administered by the department in a successful program of contracts with local government and nonprofit agencies and private groups in ways that have attracted substantial citizen effort.

(i) The department’s contract program has demonstrated that California has a large and enthusiastic corps of citizens that are eager to further the restoration of the stream and fishery resources of this state and that are willing to provide significant amounts of time and labor to that purpose.

(j) There is need for a comprehensive salmon, steelhead trout, and anadromous fisheries plan, program, and state government organization to guide the state’s efforts to protect and increase the naturally spawning salmon, steelhead trout, and anadromous fishery resources of the state.



######### 6902.  
The Legislature, for purposes of this chapter, declares as follows:

(a) It is the policy of the state to significantly increase the natural production of salmon and steelhead trout by the end of this century.  The department shall develop a plan and a program that strives to double the current natural production of salmon and steelhead trout resources.

(b) It is the policy of the state to recognize and encourage the participation of the public in privately and publicly funded mitigation, restoration, and enhancement programs in order to protect and increase naturally spawning salmon and steelhead trout resources.

(c) It is the policy of the state that  existing natural salmon and steelhead trout habitat shall not be diminished further without offsetting the impacts of the lost habitat.



######### 6903.  
It is the policy of the state and the department to encourage nonprofit salmon release and return operations subject to this code operated by, or on behalf of, licensed commercial salmon fishermen for the purpose of enhancing California’s salmon populations and increasing the salmon harvest by commercial and recreational fishermen. The department shall, to the extent that funds and personnel are available, cooperate with fishing organizations in the siting and establishment of those operations to ensure the protection of natural spawning stocks of native salmon. The organizations conducting the operations may receive salmon eggs and juvenile salmon for the purposes of the operation, and, where appropriate, shall have priority to receive salmon eggs and juvenile salmon for those purposes after the needs of habitat mitigation efforts, and state hatcheries are met.



######### 6903.5.  
The department shall encourage other nonprofit hatcheries and nonprofit artificial propagation operations, operated by, or on behalf of, licensed fishermen, for the purpose of rebuilding or enhancing marine fish populations, including, but not limited to, those for Dungeness crab, sea urchin, and California halibut, consistent with the protection of these species in the wild, in order to provide sustainable marine fish populations for harvest by commercial and recreational fishermen. The department shall, to the extent funds and personnel are available, cooperate with these nonprofit hatcheries and nonprofit artificial propagation operations in determining the feasibility, siting, and establishment of those activities and sharing technical information to ensure the protection of the marine environment.









##### ARTICLE 2. Definitions [6910 - 6912]  

######### 6910.  
Unless the context clearly requires a different meaning, the definitions in this article govern the construction of this chapter.



######### 6911.  
“Production” means the survival of fish to adulthood as measured by the abundance of the recreational and commercial catch together with the return of fish to the state’s spawning streams.



######### 6912.  
“Program” means the program for protecting and increasing the naturally spawning salmon and steelhead trout of the state provided for in Article 3 (commencing with Section 6920).









##### ARTICLE 3. Salmon, Steelhead Trout, and Anadromous Fisheries Program [6920 - 6924]  

######### 6920.  
(a) The department shall, with the advice of the Advisory Committee on Salmon and Steelhead Trout and the Commercial Salmon Trollers Advisory Committee, prepare and maintain a detailed and comprehensive program for the protection and increase of salmon, steelhead trout, and anadromous fisheries.

(b) The department shall consult with every public agency whose policies or decisions may affect the goals of this program to determine if there are feasible means for those public agencies to help the department achieve the goals of this program.



######### 6921.  
The program shall identify the measures the department will carry out to achieve the policies set forth in Section 6902.



######### 6922.  
The program shall include, but is not limited to, all of the following elements:

(a) Identification of streams where the natural production of salmon and steelhead trout can be increased primarily through the improvement of stream and streambank conditions without effect on land ownership, land use practices, or changes in streamflow operations.

(b) Identification of streams where the natural production of salmon and steelhead trout can be increased only through the improvement of land use practices or changes in streamflow operations.

(c) Identification of streams where the protection of, and increase in, salmon and steelhead trout resources require, as a result of significant prior loss of stream habitat, the construction of artificial propagation facilities.

(d) A program element for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.

(e) Recommendations for an organizational structure, staffing, budgeting, long-term sources of funding, changes in state statutes and regulations and federal and local government policy and such other administrative and legislative actions as the department finds to be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this chapter.

(f) Identification of measures to protect and increase the production of other anadromous fisheries consistent with policies set forth in Section 6902.

(g) Identification of alternatives to, or mitigation of, manmade factors which cause the loss of juvenile and adult fish in California’s stream system.



######### 6923.  
Measures which are the responsibility of other agencies or persons, such as the repair or replacement of dysfunctional fish screens, are not eligible for funding under the program.



######### 6924.  
The department shall determine the initial elements of the program and transmit a report describing those elements to the Legislature and the Advisory Committee on Salmon and Steelhead Trout within six months of the effective date of this chapter.









##### ARTICLE 4. Effect of Reduced Water Flows [6930- 6930.]  

######### 6930.  
(a) Subject to the availability of funds for the purposes of this section, the department shall contract with the University of California to conduct a study of the effects that reduced waterflows at the mouths and upstream estuaries of rivers selected under subdivision (b) would have on existing salmon and steelhead populations and on existing or prospective salmon and steelhead population restoration or reintroduction programs.

(b) The department shall select the rivers to be included in the study and shall limit its selection to rivers that are within the combined river systems described in paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 1215.5 of the Water Code, and that are the subject of an application that has been filed with the State Water Resources Control Board to appropriate water in an amount equal to more than three cubic feet per second or more than 500 acre feet per annum of storage, involving the delivery of water by means other than a pipeline, natural watercourse, well, or aqueduct to any place of use that is outside of the protected area described in paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 1215.5 of the Water Code.

(c) The findings of the study conducted under this section shall be a factor in any decision of the State Water Resources Control Board to approve or deny an application to appropriate water from any river selected under this section.  If the application involves the delivery of water, by means other than a pipeline, natural watercourse, well, or aqueduct, to any place of use that is outside of the protected area described in paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 1215.5 of the Water Code, the board may not approve that application until after the study has been completed.

(9) Coordinate and cooperate with adjacent states, as well as with Mexico and Canada, and encourage regional approaches to management of activities and uses that affect marine living resources.  Particular attention shall be paid to coordinated approaches to the management of shared fisheries.



######### 7051.  
(a) A regulation adopted pursuant to this part shall apply only to ocean waters and bays.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, nothing contained in this part grants the department or any other agency of the state any regulatory authority not in existence on January 1, 1999, in any river upstream of the mouth of such river, in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta or in any other estuary.

(b) The policies in this part shall apply only to fishery management plans and regulations adopted by the commission on or after January 1, 1999. No power is delegated to the commission or the department by this part to regulate fisheries other than the nearshore fishery, the white sea bass fishery, emerging fisheries, and fisheries for which the commission or department had regulatory authority prior to January 1, 1999.








##### CHAPTER 2. Marine Fisheries Generally [7055 - 7059]  

######### 7055.  
The Legislature finds and declares that it is the policy of the state that:

(a) California’s marine sport and commercial fisheries, and the resources upon which they depend, are important to the people of the state and, to the extent practicable, shall be managed in accordance with the policies and other requirements of this part in order to assure the long-term economic, recreational, ecological, cultural, and social benefits of those fisheries and the marine habitats on which they depend.

(b) Programs for the conservation and management of the marine fishery resources of California shall be established and administered to prevent overfishing, to rebuild depressed stocks, to ensure conservation, to facilitate long-term protection and, where feasible, restoration of marine fishery habitats, and to achieve the sustainable use of the state’s fishery resources.

(c) Where a species is the object of sportfishing, a sufficient resource shall be maintained to support a reasonable sport use, taking into consideration the necessity of regulating individual sport fishery bag limits to the quantity that is sufficient to provide a satisfying sport.

(d) The growth of commercial fisheries, including distant-water fisheries, shall be encouraged.



######### 7056.  
In order to achieve the primary fishery management goal of sustainability, every sport and commercial marine fishery under the jurisdiction of the state shall be managed under a system whose objectives include all of the following:

(a) The fishery is conducted sustainably so that long-term health of the resource is not sacrificed in favor of short-term benefits.  In the case of a fishery managed on the basis of maximum sustainable yield, management shall have optimum yield as its objective.

(b) The health of marine fishery habitat is maintained and, to the extent feasible, habitat is restored, and where appropriate, habitat is enhanced.

(c) Depressed fisheries are rebuilt to the highest sustainable yields consistent with environmental and habitat conditions.

(d) The fishery limits bycatch to acceptable types and amounts, as determined for each fishery.

(e) The fishery management system  allows fishery participants to propose methods to prevent or reduce excess effort in marine fisheries.

(f) Management of a species that is the target of both sport and commercial fisheries or of a fishery that employs different gears is closely coordinated.

(g) Fishery management decisions are adaptive and are based on the best available scientific information and other relevant information that the commission or department possesses or receives, and the commission and department have available to them essential fishery information on which to base their decisions.

(h) The management decisionmaking process is open and seeks the advice and assistance of interested parties so as to consider relevant information, including local knowledge.

(i) The fishery management system observes the long-term interests of people dependent on fishing for food, livelihood, or recreation.

(j) The adverse impacts of fishery management on small-scale fisheries, coastal communities, and local economies are minimized.

(k) Collaborative and cooperative approaches to management, involving fishery participants, marine scientists, and other interested parties are strongly encouraged, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to resolve disputes such as access, allocation, and gear conflicts.

(l) The management system is proactive and responds quickly to changing environmental conditions and market or other socioeconomic factors and to the concerns of fishery participants.

(m) The management system is periodically reviewed for effectiveness in achieving sustainability goals and for fairness and reasonableness in its interaction with people affected by management.



######### 7058.  
Any fishery management regulation adopted  by the commission shall, to the extent practicable, conform to the policies of Sections  7055 and 7056.



######### 7059.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(1) Successful marine life and fishery management is a collaborative process that requires a high degree of ongoing communication and participation of all those involved in the management process, particularly the commission, the department, and those who represent the people and resources that will be most affected by fishery management decisions, especially fishery participants and other interested parties.

(2) In order to maximize the marine science expertise applied to the complex issues of marine life and fishery management, the commission and the department are encouraged to continue to, and to find creative new ways to, contract with or otherwise effectively involve Sea Grant staff, marine scientists, economists, collaborative factfinding process and dispute resolution specialists, and others with the necessary expertise at colleges, universities, private institutions, and other agencies.

(3) The benefits of the collaborative process required by this section apply to most marine life and fishery management activities including, but not limited to, the development and implementation of research plans, marine managed area plans, fishery management plans, and plan amendments, and the preparation of fishery status reports such as those required by Section 7065.

(4) Because California is a large state with a long coast, and because travel is time consuming and costly, the involvement of interested parties shall be facilitated, to the extent practicable, by conducting meetings and discussions in the areas of the coast and in ports where those most affected are concentrated.

(b) In order to fulfill the intent of subdivision (a), the commission and the department shall do all of the following:

(1) Periodically review marine life and fishery management operations with a view to improving communication, collaboration, and dispute resolution, seeking advice from interested parties as part of the review.

(2) Develop a process for the involvement of interested parties and for factfinding and dispute resolution processes appropriate to each element in the marine life and fishery management process.  Models to consider include, but are not limited to, the take reduction teams authorized under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. Sec. 1361 et seq.) and the processes that led to improved management in the California herring, sea urchin, prawn, angel shark, and white seabass fisheries.

(3) Consider the appropriateness of various forms of fisheries comanagement, which involves close cooperation between the department and fishery participants, when developing and implementing fishery management plans.

(4) When involving fishery participants in the management process, give particular consideration to the gear used, involvement of sport or commercial sectors or both sectors, and the areas of the coast where the fishery is conducted in order to ensure adequate involvement.








##### CHAPTER 3. Fisheries Science [7060 - 7062]  

######### 7060.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares that for the purposes of sustainable fishery management and this part, essential fishery information is necessary for federally and state-managed marine fisheries important to the people of this state to provide sustainable economic and recreational benefits to the people of California.  The Legislature further finds and declares that acquiring essential fishery information can best be accomplished through the ongoing cooperation and collaboration of participants in fisheries.

During the evaluation period, the plan shall do both of the following:

(1) In order to prevent excess fishing effort during the evaluation period, limit taking in the fishery by means that may include, but need not be limited to, restricting landings, time, area, gear, or access to a level that the department determines is necessary for evaluation of the fishery.

(2) Contain a research plan that includes objectives for evaluating the fishery, a description of the methods and data collection techniques for evaluating the fishery, and a timetable for completing the evaluation.

(f) The commission is authorized to impose a fee on an emerging fishery in order to pay the costs of implementing this chapter. The fees may include, but need not be limited to, ocean fishing stamps and permit fees. The fees may not be levied in excess of the necessary costs to implement and administer this chapter. The commission may reduce fees annually if it determines that sufficient revenues exist to cover costs incurred by the department in administering this chapter. The commission and the department, with the advice of fishery participants and other interested parties, shall consider alternative ways to fund the evaluation of emerging fisheries.

(g) An emerging fishery is subject to this section unless the department incorporates the fishery into a fishery management plan developed under Sections 7070 to 7088, inclusive.

(h) In the event that this section is found to conflict with Section 1022, 8614, or 8615, this section shall prevail.

(b) Except as provided in subdivision (f) or (g), the operator of a vessel on which salmon are taken for commercial purposes shall not permit a person on board that vessel while salmon are being taken or transported unless that person was less than 18 years of age or 70 years of age or more on April 1 of the current license year or that person has a commercial fishing salmon stamp affixed to the person’s commercial fishing license.

(c) Except as provided in this subdivision, the department shall issue a commercial fishing salmon stamp upon application therefor and payment of the fee of eighty-five dollars ($85). For any commercial salmon season preceded by a commercial salmon season in which the commercial troll salmon landings in this state equal or exceed 3,000,000 pounds dressed weight, as determined by the department, the fee shall be increased by twelve dollars and fifty cents ($12.50) for every 250,000 pounds over 3,000,000 pounds of dressed weight landings, except that the total fees as adjusted shall not exceed two hundred sixty dollars ($260).

(d) A commercial fishing salmon stamp is valid during the commercial salmon season of the year in which it was issued.

(e) Upon application and payment of an additional fee equal to that prescribed in subdivision (c), the department may issue an additional commercial fishing salmon stamp for a crewmember to the owner or operator of a vessel who holds a commercial fishing salmon stamp.

(1) The crewmember is designated by name and commercial fishing license number on a form furnished by the department before salmon are taken on the vessel when that crewmember is aboard.

(2) The crewmember has a valid commercial fishing license issued under Section 7850.

(3) The commercial fishing salmon stamp for the crewmember is affixed to the form prescribed in paragraph (1) on which the vessel registration number of the vessel is entered and on which the crewmember who is exempted by this subdivision is designated by the last entered name and commercial fishing license number.

(a) After deducting the administrative costs for issuing the commercial fishing salmon stamps, the department shall deposit the fees received pursuant to Section 7860 in the Commercial Salmon Stamp Dedicated Subaccount, which is hereby established in the Fish and Game Preservation Fund. The money in the subaccount shall be available to the department, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for new or expanded salmon restoration and enhancement programs in the state that will serve to increase ocean salmon landings. No money in this subaccount shall be used in lieu of other funds appropriated for salmon restoration and enhancement programs authorized by law on or before January 1, 1988.

(b) (1) Thirty dollars ($30) of the fees collected for each commercial fishing salmon stamp issued shall be allocated by the department to be used for raising chinook salmon to a yearling size, at which size they shall be released into state waters. The amount of salmon stamp revenues expended for this purpose in any fiscal year shall not exceed the amount expended by the department for the same purpose during the same period from other funds. The calculation of the amount expended by the department for this purpose shall not include expenditures made by the department for which reimbursements are received from state or federal agencies, public utilities, or private entities for raising chinook salmon to yearling size as part of a fish mitigation program instituted to compensate for the adverse effect of a dam on natural salmon production. If the department expends no funds other than moneys collected from the sale of commercial fishing salmon stamps or moneys for which reimbursements are received as part of an anadromous fish mitigation program for the raising of chinook salmon to yearling size within the period of a fiscal year, the fees prescribed in Section 7860 shall be reduced by an amount equivalent to that portion of the commercial fishing salmon stamp program, as specified in this subdivision.

(2) If the salmon stamps issued pursuant to Section 7860 raise more money for the purpose of this subdivision than is necessary to match the funds expended by the department during any fiscal year from other funds, then the excess salmon stamp revenue allocated pursuant to this subdivision shall be carried over into the following fiscal year.

(c) The department shall post on its Internet Web site an accounting of the projects undertaken with funds from the Commercial Salmon Stamp Dedicated Subaccount and the costs incurred to administer the program. At a minimum, the Internet Web site shall list the project title, the applicant, a brief description of the project, the amount approved, and the status of the project.

Notwithstanding any other law, the department may receive on behalf of the Commercial Salmon Trollers Enhancement and Restoration Program, for deposit in the Commercial Salmon Stamp Dedicated Subaccount in the Fish and Game Preservation Fund established pursuant to Section 7861, funds from sources in addition to funds derived from the sale of commercial fishing salmon stamps, including, but not limited to, grants from the federal government, grants from private foundations, money disbursed from court settlements, and donations and bequeaths from individuals. The additional nonfederal funds shall not be deposited in the Commercial Salmon Stamp Dedicated Subaccount unless the person or entity providing the funds specifically designates in writing, prior to or at the time of transmittal of the funds to the department, that the funds are intended solely for deposit to that subaccount. Funds received by the department that are not designated at the time of receipt as being intended solely for deposit to the Commercial Salmon Stamp Dedicated Subaccount shall be deposited in the Fish and Game Preservation Fund.



######### 7861.3.

In no case shall moneys from the General Fund be used to match the salmon stamp revenues expended for this program. It is the further intent of the Legislature that the salmon stamp fee authorized in subdivision (b) of Section 7861 shall generate revenues equal to one-half the amount necessary to raise this number of salmon to yearling size.



######### 7861.4.  
A priority for funding shall be given to programs and projects restoring, enhancing, and protecting salmon streams with funds appropriated pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (e) of Section 5907 of the Public Resources Code, that employ fishermen who are unemployed or underemployed as a result of commercial fishing restrictions within and immediately adjacent to the Klamath Management Zone imposed by federal laws or regulations.

(c) The director, upon receiving the recommendation of the committee, and upon finding that there will be no new costs to the department, may authorize the recommended entity to create or contract to create salmon or salmon fishing artwork and other materials based on that artwork, including, but not limited to, a stamp, and offer those items for sale to the public, for the purpose described in subdivision (a).

(d) No person or entity, including, but not limited to, any nonprofit organization, may use the name of the Commercial Salmon Stamp, the Commercial Salmon Trollers Advisory Committee, or the Commercial Salmon Trollers Enhancement and Restoration Program for the sale of artwork and other materials, unless that person or entity has been approved by the director under this section for that purpose. The approval of the director under this section shall be for one year, after which the approval may be renewed for an additional year, upon recommendation of the committee.

(e) No artwork sold in the form of a stamp under this section conveys to the purchaser any entitlement to engage in the commercial salmon fishery.

The reference to Section 845 in the last sentence is to Sections 8630 to 8632, inclusive, of this code. It reads as follows:

1110—No person shall use or operate or assist in using or operating in this State or the waters thereof, any boat or vessel used in connection with fishing operations irrespective of its home port or port of registration, which fishing boat or vessel delivers or by which there is delivered to any point or place other than within this State any fish, mollusks or crustaceans which are caught in, or taken aboard said boat or vessel from, the waters of the Pacific Ocean within this State or on the high seas or elsewhere, unless a permit authorizing the same shall have been issued by the Fish and Game Commission.

Where it appears to the commission that such permit will not tend to prevent, impede or obstruct the operation, enforcement or administration of this code or any provision thereof, and will not tend to result in fish, mollusks or crustaceans in the waters of this State being taken or used otherwise than is authorized by this code, the commission may issue revocable permits under such rules and regulations and upon such terms and conditions as it may prescribe to deliver fish, mollusks or crustaceans by the use of such boat or vessel outside of this State, provided that nothing herein shall authorize the transportation or carrying out of this State or any district thereof, of any fish, mollusks or crustaceans where the same is prohibited by law, and no permit shall be issued which may tend to deplete any species of fish, mollusk or crustacean, or result in waste thereof. Any person who uses or operates or assists in using or operating any boat or vessel in violation of the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and such boat or vessel and the net, gear or other equipment of said boat or vessel is a public nuisance and shall be forfeited. It is the duty of every person authorized to make an arrest for the violation of any of the provisions of this code, to seize and keep such boat, vessel, net, gear or other equipment and to report such seizure to the commission. The commission shall thereupon commence, in the superior court of the county or city and county in which or nearest to which the seizure is made, proceedings for forfeiture of the seized property for its use in violation of this section, and such proceeding shall be had in the manner and according to the procedure provided by Section 845 of this code for the forfeiture of nets.

##### ARTICLE 8. Reduction Permits [8075 - 8080]  

######### 8075.  
The commission may grant a permit, subject to such regulations as it may prescribe, to take and use fish by a reduction or extraction process.



######### 8076.  
No reduction of fish shall be permitted which may tend to deplete the species, or result in waste or deterioration of fish.



######### 8077.  
No permit shall be issued except after a public hearing and a finding by the commission that the granting thereof would promote the economic utilization of the fish resources of the State in the public interest. In making such finding the commission shall take into consideration the interest of the people of the State in the utilization and conservation of the fish supply and all economic and other factors relating thereto, including the efficient and economical operation of reduction plants.



######### 8078.  
A hearing pursuant to this article shall be held within 30 days after application for a permit, upon such notice as the commission shall prescribe. The commission may extend such a hearing from time to time for a total period of not more than 30 days.



######### 8079.  
The commission shall, whenever necessary to prevent overexpansion, to insure the efficient and economical operation of reduction plants, or to otherwise carry out the provisions of this article, limit the total number of permits which are granted.



######### 8079.1.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this code or regulation adopted pursuant to this code, the director or a representative appointed by the director, may, without notice or a hearing, grant a license to a fish reduction plant to dispose of dead or dying fish. The license may be immediately issued by the director or the director’s representative whenever that person determines, in that person’s discretion, that an emergency situation exists. The estimated tonnage to be reduced shall be specified as a limit in the license.



######### 8080.  
Nothing in this article restricts the power of any court in any proceeding relating to any matter arising out of the provisions of this article.









##### ARTICLE 9. Limited Entry Fisheries [8100 - 8104]  

######### 8100.  
“Limited entry fishery” means a fishery in which the number of persons who may participate or the number of vessels that may be used in taking a specified species of fish is limited by statute or regulation.



######### 8101.  
(a) Any licensed fisherman shall be eligible for inclusion during the initial year of a limited entry fishery which is established by statute that becomes operative after January 1, 1982, or by regulation that becomes operative after January 1, 1999, regardless of the prescribed conditions for entry into the fishery, if the fisherman presents to the department satisfactory evidence that he or she has been licensed as a California commercial fisherman for at least 20 years and has participated in the fishery for at least one of those 20 years, with qualifying participation in the fishery to be determined by the commission based on landings or other appropriate criteria.

(b) Fishermen who have established eligibility to participate in a limited entry fishery under this section are subject to conditions of continuing eligibility established by statute or regulation if those fishermen desire to maintain their eligibility.



######### 8102.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares that, in some limited entry fisheries, two or more partners may be operating with one of the partners holding the permit to participate in the fishery. The Legislature further finds and declares that undocumented, de facto, family partnerships are a longstanding custom in these fisheries. The Legislature further finds and declares that great hardship results when the permittee partner is no longer able to continue working and leaves the other partner without a permit to continue participating in the fishery.

(b) In any limited entry fishery in which permits are allocated to participants in the fishery, and where the death, incapacity, or retirement of a permittee from that fishery would deprive a working partner of the permittee of the ability to continue to derive a livelihood from that fishery, a permit shall be issued, upon application, to one remaining partner.

(c) A working partner for the purposes of this section shall be a spouse, child (including an adopted child), or sibling of the permittee, whose investment or equity need not be proven by documentation, or a person who can prove an investment or equity in the vessel or gear used in the fishery, and who would otherwise have been eligible for a permit and did not obtain one because he or she was working with or was a partner with the permittee.

(d) The working partner shall also provide substantial evidence of an actual physical working participation aboard the vessel supported by the submission of documents filed with the Franchise Tax Board and supported by trip settlement sheets or similar documents that demonstrate earnings from that participation. “Trip settlement sheet” means a document prepared after a vessel has completed a fishing trip which displays the costs incurred, revenues received, and profits paid out. Investment or equity alone does not establish that the person is a working partner.

(e) Those existing working partners other than the family relationships specified in subdivision (c) may, not later than February 1, 1984, declare and prove the working partnership in a manner satisfactory to the department and request that the department state the fact of the working partnership upon the permit. Thereafter, a nonfamily working partnership shall be declared, proved, and noted upon any limited entry permit at the first issuance of the permit.

(f) This article does not apply to permits to take herring for roe in California.



######### 8103.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares as follows:

(1) The accidental death of a limited entry permittee results in great hardships on the permittee’s family.

(2) Under the law as it existed immediately prior to January 1, 1987, if a member of the permittee’s family has not been actively working in the fishery, the limited entry permit could not be transferred to a member of the family, an action which deprives the family of the opportunity to continue to derive a livelihood from the fishery and which imposes greater hardships.

(3) When there is an accidental death of a limited entry permittee, a transition period is necessary to allow a family member to join the fishery and to become acclimated, knowledgeable, and experienced in the fishery.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 8102, the department shall transfer a permit for a limited entry fishery, upon application, to a parent, spouse, child, or sibling of a permittee whose death was the result of an accident which occurred after January 1, 1986.

(c) Application for the transfer of a permit pursuant to subdivision (b) shall be made on or before January 1, 1987, or not more than one year after the death of the permittee, whichever is later.

(d) The director may authorize another person, when requested by the new permittee, to serve in the place of the new permittee and to engage in fishing activities under the authority of the limited entry permit for not more than two years from the date of the permit transfer.

(e) “Accidental death” means death resulting directly and solely from any of the following:

(1) An accidental injury visible on the surface of the body or disclosed by an autopsy, sustained solely by external, violent, and accidental means.

(2) A disease or infection resulting directly from an accidental injury and beginning within 30 days after the date of the injury.

(3) An accidental drowning.



######### 8104.  
Upon the death of a limited entry permittee, the permit shall vest in the permittee’s estate or in the surviving community estate and may be transferred by the executor, administrator, personal representative, or surviving spouse to a qualified pointholder pursuant to Section 8552.2 or to a partner qualified pursuant to Section 8552.6. This transfer shall be initiated by notice to the department, in writing, sent by certified mail, within one year of the date of death. If no transfer is initiated within one year of the date of death, the permit shall revert to the department for disposition pursuant to Section 8552.4 and shall be thereafter treated as a herring permit that has not been renewed. The department may, upon written application, grant an extension of time up to one additional year for the transfer to be initiated.

It is unlawful for any person to do any of the following:

(a) To buy, sell, trade, process, or possess salmon, or attempt to buy, sell, trade, process, or possess salmon, with the knowledge that the salmon has been, or will be, obtained by high seas interception.

(b) To knowingly provide financing, premises, equipment, supplies, services, power, or fuel used to buy, sell, trade, process, or possess salmon that has been, or will be, obtained by high seas interception.

(c) Act as a broker or middleman, or otherwise act on behalf of another person, to arrange for or negotiate, or attempt to arrange for or negotiate, the purchase, sale, trade, processing, or possession of salmon, with the knowledge that the salmon has been, or will be, obtained by high seas interception.



######### 8122.  
It is unlawful for any person to create, circulate, or possess any written instrument related to salmon with the knowledge that the written instrument conveys misleading or untrue information about the ownership, possession, processing, origin, destination, route of shipping, type, or condition of salmon, or the time, place, and manner of the taking of the salmon.



######### 8123.  
(a) If any person knows that a vessel contains salmon obtained by high seas interception or that the owner or operator of the vessel intends to engage in the high seas interception of salmon, it is unlawful for that person to do any of the following:

(1) Move persons, cargo, or other property to or from the vessel.

(2) Service or repair the vessel or its equipment.

(3) Provide the vessel with power, supplies, equipment, or fuel.

(4) Provide the vessel with information, other than weather reports, capable of aiding the high seas interception of salmon or frustrating or avoiding detection, including communicating the movements, intentions, or activities of state or federal law enforcement officials or other fishing vessels.

(5) Permit the vessel to dock or anchor, or to remain docked or anchored, if that person is responsible for the operation of the facility, harbor, or anchorage.

(b) This section does not prohibit any person from performing any act or acts set forth in subdivision (a), if that person reasonably believes that the act or acts were necessary for humanitarian or environmental purposes or to prevent a significant loss of property, if that person provides immediate notice, by the quickest available means, to the United States Coast Guard, the department, or any law enforcement agency as to the type of assistance provided and the circumstances involved.









##### ARTICLE 12. Commercial Fisheries Capacity Reduction Program [8125 - 8126]  

######### 8125.  
There is hereby established the Commercial Fisheries Capacity Reduction Account in the Fish and Game Preservation Fund. Fees collected pursuant to Section 8126 shall be deposited into the account. Money in the account shall be used to repay the California fishermen’s share of any federal loans used in the federal West Coast Groundfish Fishery Capacity Reduction Program (Sec. 212, P.L. 107-206).

######### 8140.  
All fish, the taking of which is not otherwise restricted for commercial purposes, by state or federal law or any regulations adopted pursuant to those laws, may be taken at any time for commercial purposes.









##### ARTICLE 2. Sardines [8150.5 - 8154]

(a) The Legislature finds and declares that commercial salmon fishing is in the public interest and that the preservation of commercial salmon fishing directly affects the health and welfare of the public.  The Legislature further finds and declares that, due to past declines in salmon stocks, the increase in the quality and value of salmon on the market, the number and types of vessels being used, the commensurate salmon fishing potential of the commercial salmon fishing fleet, and the demand for entry into the commercial salmon fishery, it is necessary and proper to limit the persons who are eligible to take salmon for commercial purposes and to regulate the amount of salmon that may be taken by restricting the number and salmon fishing potential of the vessels in the commercial salmon fishing fleet in order to preserve and rebuild the salmon resource, to protect commercial salmon fishing, and thereby to protect the health and welfare of the public.

(b) The Legislature further finds and declares the following:

(1) The salmon resource declined in 1983 and 1984 as a result of the most severe warm water El Nino current of this century, which caused major disruptions and hardship in the commercial salmon fishery.  Habitat destruction in the rivers of California has also depleted the salmon stocks which are bred and reared in those rivers.

(2) The Pacific Fishery Management Council has imposed season closures on the taking of salmon since 1982, including a total prohibition on commercial taking of salmon in 1985 along portions of the northern California coast to protect the king salmon stock from the Klamath River.  In 1987, a five-year agreement was signed which allocates the king salmon stock from the Klamath River between ocean commercial and recreational users and in-river Indian and recreational users.  This agreement may result in further closures.

(3) Nearly 30 percent of the commercial salmon fishing vessels which were permitted to take salmon for commercial purposes in California did not record landings of salmon in the 1986 and 1987 commercial salmon seasons.

(4) There are more than enough commercial salmon fishing vessels for which commercial salmon fishing permits have been issued to harvest the less than 10 million pounds of salmon that are currently available annually.  With the present fleet makeup between large vessels and small vessels and between full-time and part-time fishermen, it is estimated that the present resource capacity may accommodate a fleet of not more than 2,500 permitted vessels. Therefore, no new permits should be issued until the time that the fleet size falls below 2,500 permitted vessels.  Adequate provision for entry of new persons or vessels to the commercial salmon fishery is afforded by transfers of vessels for which permits have been issued and renewed and by transfers of those existing permits to vessels of the same or less salmon fishing potential.



######### 8231.  
The following definitions govern the construction of this article:

(a) “Agent” means the person designated in writing by the owner as the owner’s representative.

(b) “Change of ownership” means the transfer of ownership of a permitted vessel to a new owner.

(c) “Commercial salmon vessel permit” means an annual permit issued by the department to an owner of a commercial fishing vessel for use of that vessel to take salmon for commercial purposes and shall not be considered personal property.

(d) “Fishing potential” means the capability and capacity for harvesting salmon of a particular commercial fishing vessel.

(e) “Permit” means a commercial salmon vessel permit as defined in subdivision (c).

(f) “Permitted vessel” means a commercial fishing vessel for which a permit is currently valid.

(g) “Replacement vessel” means a commercial fishing vessel for the use of which a permit is proposed to be transferred pursuant to this article.

(h) “Transfer” means the issuance of a permit for use of a replacement vessel.



######### 8232.  
It is unlawful to take or possess salmon for commercial purposes on a vessel unless all of the following conditions are met:

(a) The vessel is registered with the department pursuant to Section 7881, and the owner of the vessel has a valid commercial salmon vessel permit for the use of that vessel.

(b) The permit for the use of the vessel is affixed to the vessel adjacent to the department registration  number unless otherwise authorized by the department.

(c) The permit affixed to the vessel is visible at all times.



######### 8232.5.  
(a) Except as provided in this section, it is unlawful to take salmon for sport purposes on a permitted vessel.

(b) Subdivision (a) does not prohibit taking salmon for sport purposes under a sportfishing or a sport ocean fishing license, which is issued pursuant to Article 3 (commencing with Section 7145) of Chapter 1, on a vessel licensed as a commercial passenger fishing boat pursuant to Section 7920 and engaged in that business on any day when salmon are not being taken for commercial purposes on that vessel.

(c) Subdivision (a) does not prohibit taking salmon for sport purposes under a sportfishing or a sport ocean fishing license, which is issued pursuant to Article 3 (commencing with Section 7145) of Chapter 1, on a permitted vessel in the Klamath Management Zone, as designated by the federal Pacific Fisheries Management Council, when the commercial salmon season is closed and after 24 hours after the time when salmon taken during the commercial salmon season are required to be landed.

(d) The use of a vessel pursuant to subdivision (c) shall be considered as being engaged or employed exclusively in the taking and possession of fish or other living resource of the sea for commercial purposes for purposes of subdivision (a) of Section 227 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.



######### 8233.

######### 8233.4.  
Except as otherwise provided in this article, the department shall issue a permit, upon payment of the transfer fees pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 8239 and surrender to the department of the permit for the use of the permitted vessel, to the owner of a replacement vessel that is registered with the department pursuant to Section 7881, if the transfer has been approved pursuant to Section 8241.



######### 8233.5.  
Except as otherwise provided in this article, the department shall change the designation of the holder of a permit, and with it shall go all rights, privileges, and obligations of a permit holder, including rights of renewal, upon receipt of a notice of change of ownership to a new owner of a permitted vessel.

######### 8235.  
(a) The owner of a permitted vessel, or that owner’s agent, may apply for renewal of the permit annually on or before April 30, upon payment of the fees established under subdivision (b), without penalty. Upon receipt of the application and fees, the department shall issue the permit for use of the permitted vessel in the subsequent permit year only to the owner of the permitted vessel.

(b) The department shall fix the annual fee for the renewal of the permit in an amount it determines to be necessary to pay the reasonable costs of implementing and administering this article.

(c) If an owner to whom a permit has been issued, or that owner’s agent, applies for renewal of the permit, the application for renewal shall be received or, if mailed, postmarked, on or before April 30. An application received or, if mailed, postmarked, after April 30 shall be assessed a late fee subject to Section 7852.2. The department shall issue the permit for use of the permitted vessel in the subsequent permit year.

The notice shall be sent by first-class mail before March 1.  The department shall mail a copy of the notice for renewal to all associations and groups known to the department  to be representing commercial salmon fishermen.  The department shall also provide blank permit renewal applications at appropriate offices of the department.

(b) The notice shall include all of the following:

(1) Instructions on how to apply for renewal of a permit.

(2) Information on the provisions of subdivisions (c) and (e) of Section 8235. 

(c) Failure to receive the notice under this section does not exempt or excuse the owner from the requirement of annual renewal of the permit on or before the permit expiration date.



######### 8237.  
(a) The department shall change the designation of the holder of a permit to the new owner of a permitted vessel upon change of ownership of the permitted vessel, whether the change of ownership is by contract, by operation of law, or otherwise.

(b) The permit shall not be transferred to any other vessel, except by the issuance of a permit for use of the replacement vessel pursuant to subdivision (c) and Sections 8239 to 8241, inclusive.

(c) The owner of the permitted vessel may seek to retire the permitted vessel from the commercial salmon fishery and apply for transfer of the permit, to be issued pursuant to Section 8241, for use of a replacement vessel.



######### 8238.  
(a) On or before January 1, 1991, the department, in consultation with the commercial salmon fishing review board, created pursuant to former Section 8247, shall establish and adopt, in the manner prescribed in former Section 8238.3, as that section read on January 1, 1991, a vessel classification system to determine the fishing potential of prospective vessels for applications for new, original permits.

(b) Commencing January 1, 2020, for applications to transfer a permit to a replacement vessel, the department shall determine the fishing potential of the permitted vessel and the replacement vessel by multiplying the length of the vessel by the breadth of the vessel by the depth of the vessel based on figures provided to the department in a vessel marine survey conducted by a licensed marine surveyor or on a current certificate of documentation issued by the United States Coast Guard.



######### 8238.1.  
The vessel classification system shall be used by the department for issuance of new original vessel permits pursuant to Section 8243.



######### 8239.  
A transfer may be approved and a permit issued for use of a replacement vessel pursuant to Section 8241 under all of the following conditions:

(a) The vessel owner submits a written request for the transfer to the department on a form provided by the department and pays a nonrefundable transfer fee of two hundred dollars ($200).

(b) The permit for the permitted vessel is current, and the owner of the permitted vessel makes assurances in the application that any renewal of the permit that becomes due during the application processing period will be made.

(c) Proof of ownership is submitted to the department for the permitted vessel and replacement vessel.

(d) The vessel owner submits a vessel marine survey conducted by a licensed marine surveyor or a current certificate of documentation issued by the United States Coast Guard that contains the necessary information for the department to establish that the replacement vessel has the same fishing potential as, or less fishing potential than, the permitted vessel.

(e) Under penalty of perjury, the vessel owner signs the application for transfer and certifies that the included information is true to the best of their information and belief.

(f) The same transfer has not been requested within the previous 12 months or the same transfer has not previously been denied and that denial is final, unless the application or supporting information are different than that contained in the previous application, as determined by the department.

(g) Except as provided in Section 8239.1, the permit has not been transferred to a replacement vessel during the same permit year.

(h) The permittee has written authority from the legal owner, if other than the permittee or mortgager, if any, to transfer the vessel permit from the permitted vessel.



######### 8239.1.  
Unless otherwise prohibited, the department shall accept a transfer application within two years after the date that a permitted vessel was lost, stolen, or destroyed, notwithstanding any inability to physically examine the permitted vessel to determine its salmon fishing potential. Only the permittee at the time of the loss, theft, or destruction of the vessel may apply for the transfer of the vessel permit. Proof that a vessel is lost, stolen, or destroyed shall be in the form of a copy of the report filed with the United States Coast Guard or any other law enforcement agency or fire department investigating the loss. The department shall only transfer a permit pursuant to this section if the permit remains valid during the entire period following the loss, theft, or destruction, and while the transfer application is pending. If the permittee does not submit a transfer application within two years after the permitted vessel was lost, stolen, or destroyed, or if the department denies the transfer application later than two years after a permitted vessel was lost, stolen, or destroyed, the permit is null and void.



######### 8239.6.  
A permit issued for the use of a replacement vessel under Section 8241 is valid for the balance of the permit year for which the permit for the use of the permitted vessel was originally issued or last renewed, and the permit issued under this section authorizes the use of the replacement vessel only for that period.



######### 8240.  
(a) The department shall not issue a permit for use of a replacement vessel if the permitted vessel was reported as lost, stolen, or destroyed by fraudulent means or for fraudulent purposes.

(b) The department shall not issue a permit for use of a replacement vessel if the application contains or is accompanied with fraudulent or willfully misleading information.

(c) The department shall not issue a permit for use of a replacement vessel or to a new owner of a permitted vessel if the permit for the permitted vessel expires and is not renewed.  Except as provided in Section 8235, an owner of a permitted vessel shall renew the permit before the expiration date even if that owner has a transfer application pending.

(d) The department may refuse to issue a permit for use of a replacement vessel or to issue a permit to a new owner of a permitted vessel on any grounds for which a permit may be suspended or revoked.



######### 8241.  
The department shall issue the permit for use of a replacement vessel if it determines that the conditions specified in Section 8239 have been satisfied and the replacement vessel has the same fishing potential as, or less fishing potential than, the permitted vessel.



######### 8242.  
A person seeking to gain entry into the commercial salmon fishery may obtain a permit under either of the following conditions:

(a) By legally obtaining the ownership of a permitted vessel and notifying the department of the change of ownership of the permitted vessel.

(b) By applying to obtain a new, original permit issued by the department pursuant to Sections 8244 and 8245.



######### 8243.  
(a) If the department determines that the number of permitted vessels is less than 2,500, the department shall determine the number and vessel classification for which any new, original permits may be issued to bring the total number of permitted vessels to no more than 2,500.

(b) New, original permits to be issued shall be authorized by vessel classifications established under Section 8238.



######### 8244.  
(a) An applicant may apply for a new, original permit as an individual, a joint venture, or a corporation. The applicant may submit only one application annually. The application shall be made on a form provided by the department.

(b) An applicant for a new, original permit under this section shall submit a completed application as directed by the department. The completed application, and the application fees prescribed in subdivision (c), shall be delivered or postmarked on or before February 1 in order to be considered for permits for the subsequent permit year.

(c) The applicant shall submit with the application a nonrefundable application fee determined by the department in an amount sufficient to pay the costs of administering the issuance of new, original permits by the department, which shall be not less than thirty-five dollars ($35).

(d) The department shall determine the fishing potential of the vessel for use of which the new, original permit is to be issued and otherwise determine if the applicant is eligible to be issued a permit under this article.



######### 8245.  
(a) The department shall conduct a drawing from the applicants determined to be eligible for new, original permits pursuant to Section 8244 on the first Friday in March of each year that new, original permits are authorized to be issued pursuant to Section 8243.

(b) (1) The department shall issue a permit to each of those applicants who are drawn upon payment of the fees prescribed in paragraph (2) for the permit and, except as provided in subdivision (d), submittal of sufficient information to establish that the applicant is the owner of a vessel within the vessel classification designated in the application.

(2) The amount of the fees for a permit issued under this section are the same as the amount of the fees for renewal of a permit for the subsequent license year beginning on April 1 that are established pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 8235. A successful applicant shall pay the fees for the permit on or before March 31. The department shall deposit the fees to the fund pursuant to Section 13001.

(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), a successful applicant shall submit proof of ownership of the vessel to be used under the permit within 90 days of the drawing.

(d) (1) A successful applicant may request one extension of no more than 90 days to obtain a vessel as designated in the application. The department may grant that extension.

(2) If any successful applicant does not establish that the applicant is the owner of a vessel as designated in the application and affix the new permit on that vessel or on another vessel with the same or less fishing potential, as determined by the department, within 90 days or by the end of a 90 day extension granted by the department, the new permit is null and void.

(3) The department is not liable for any risk of failure by the applicant to obtain a vessel that is designated in an application or to complete the process for determination of the fishing potential of another vessel, or for failure by the applicant to obtain that other vessel, in the time prescribed in this section.



######### 8246.  
(a) At any time after notice of an order suspending or revoking of a person’s commercial salmon fishing privilege is issued by the commission, and before the order of suspension or revocation is final, the commission may, with the agreement of the person subject to the action, compromise or dismiss the action to suspend or revoke the commercial salmon fishing privilege in the best interests of the state, or the commission may compromise or dismiss the action with the agreement of the person subject to the action on terms and conditions, which may include, but are not limited to, the payment of civil damages, the reduction of a revocation to a suspension for a specified period of time, or any other terms and conditions.

(b) The commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, may suspend or revoke the commercial fishing privilege, authorized under a license issued for the purposes of Section 7850, for any violation of a term or condition of an agreement to compromise or dismiss a separate suspension or revocation action that was made pursuant to subdivision (a).

(c) If the commission orders a suspension or revocation of a person’s commercial salmon fishing privilege, any permit issued pursuant to this article shall be renewed when the next renewal is due or the permit shall expire as provided in Section 8233.

(d) Subdivision (b) does not apply if an action is brought to recover civil damages under Section 2014 from the person subject to action under this section.



######### 8246.2.

(1) The gravity of the violation.

(2) The good faith of the convicted licensee.

(3) The history of previous violations.

(4) The damage to the fishery.

(5) The cost of restoration of the fishery.

(b) Civil damages imposed under subdivision (b) of Section 8246 shall be due and payable on or before a date that is 30 days after the compromise is entered into.



######### 8246.4.  
The commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall revoke a commercial salmon vessel permit issued pursuant to this article if the vessel permit was obtained by fraudulent means.



######### 8246.6.  
A person whose commercial salmon fishing vessel permit is revoked by the commission or who has been denied a permit transfer may appeal the revocation or denial to the commission by submitting the appeal in writing to the commission within 60 days of the decision.



######### 8246.7.  
(a) The commission shall reverse an order of revocation, order the permit renewed, or order the approval of a permit transfer only if it finds one of the following grounds:

(1) The permittee failed to submit an application and pay the fees for renewal on or before April 30 pursuant to Section 8235 and the failure to renew a permit until after the expiration date was due to death, physical illness, mental incapacity, or being called to active military duty, and the person was not reasonably able to have an agent renew the permit.

(2) A lienholder of a permitted vessel, if the vessel is the property of the lienholder as a result of foreclosure, surrender, or litigation, can show loss due to the nonrenewal of a permit by the permittee, and the nonrenewal occurred without the knowledge of the lienholder.

(3) If, in the case of permit revocation because of fraud, evidence is provided to the commission disputing the charges of fraud. If the commission finds there was no fraud after consideration of all of the evidence, the commission may order the revocation annulled, and, if the permit expiration date has passed during the pendency of the hearing on the appeal, the commission may order the department to renew the permit upon payment of the fees.

(4) The denial of the permit transfer was arbitrary or capricious.

(b) Each appeal shall be heard and considered separately on its own merits.



######### 8246.8.  
The commission and the department may make and enforce regulations that may be necessary or convenient for carrying out any power, authority, or jurisdiction delegated to it under this article.



######### 8248.

##### ARTICLE 5. Lobster [8250 - 8259]  

######### 8250.  
As used in this code, “spiny lobster” refers to the species Panulirus interruptus.



######### 8250.5.  
(a) Subject to this article and Article 1 (commencing with Section 9000) of Chapter 4, a lobster trap, as described in Section 9010, may be used to take lobster for commercial purposes under a lobster permit issued pursuant to Section 8254.

(b) The following species may be taken incidentally in lobster traps being fished under the authority of a lobster permit issued pursuant to Section 8254, and any other species taken incidentally shall be immediately released back to the water:

(1) Crab, other than Dungeness crab.

(2) Kellet’s whelk.

(3) Octopus.

(c) Spiny lobsters taken in the manner commonly known as skindiving or by a person using self-contained underwater breathing apparatus shall not be sold.



######### 8251.

######### 8252.  
No spiny lobster less than three and one-quarter inches in length measured in a straight line from the rear edge of the eye socket to the rear edge of the body shell, both points to be on the midline of the back, may be taken, possessed, purchased, or sold.

Every person taking spiny lobster shall carry a measuring device and shall measure any lobster immediately on removal from his trap and if it is found to be undersize the lobster shall be returned to the water immediately.



######### 8253.  
It is unlawful to pickle, can, or otherwise preserve any spiny lobster, but spiny lobsters may be preserved by freezing and may be cooked for consumption in the fresh state.



######### 8254.  
(a) Lobsters shall not be taken for commercial purposes except under a valid lobster permit issued to that person that has not been suspended or revoked, subject to regulations adopted by the commission.

(b) Every person who takes, assists in taking, possesses, or transports lobsters for commercial purposes while on any boat, barge, or vessel, or who uses or operates or assists in using or operating any boat, net, trap, line, or other appliance to take lobsters for commercial purposes, shall have a valid lobster permit.

(c) The permit fee for a lobster permit is two hundred sixty-five dollars ($265).

(d) The fee for a lobster crewmember permit is one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125).

(e) For the purposes of this section, it is prima facie evidence that lobster is taken for commercial purposes if the possession of lobster is more than three times the sport bag limit.



######### 8254.7.  
When a complaint has been filed in a court of competent jurisdiction charging a holder of a commercial lobster permit with a violation of Section 8251 or 8252, and no disposition of the complaint has occurred within 90 days after it has been filed in the court, the department may suspend the commercial lobster permit of the person. The permitholder whose permit was suspended under this section may, within 10 days after the receipt of the suspension notice from the department, request a hearing, and, within 20 days after the request has been made, a hearing shall be held by the commission. A decision shall be made within a reasonable time on whether the suspension of the permit shall be terminated or continued until the disposition of the complaint by the court. In determining whether to terminate or continue the suspension of the permit, the commission shall consider whether or not the violation could have a detrimental effect on the resources and whether or not a continued suspension of the permit is in the best public interest, and shall find whether there is sufficient evidence that a violation has occurred. A failure to make a finding that there is sufficient evidence that a violation has occurred or a finding that there is insufficient evidence shall terminate the suspension of the permit under this section. If the permitholder is acquitted of the charges or the charges against him or her have been dismissed, any suspension of the permit is thereby terminated. No complaint shall be filed in a court charging a commercial lobster permitholder with a violation of Section 8251 or 8252 unless evidence supporting the charge has been reviewed by the appropriate county or city prosecuting agency and a criminal complaint has been issued by that agency.



######### 8257.  
The permit number of the person owning or in command of any boat used to take lobster shall be visibly displayed on both sides of the boat in 10-inch black numbers, one inch wide, on a white background.

######### 8276.5.  
(a) In consultation with the Dungeness crab task force, or its appointed representatives, the director shall adopt a program, by March 31, 2013, for Dungeness crab trap limits for all California permits. Unless the director finds that there is consensus in the Dungeness crab industry that modifications to the following requirements are more desirable, with evidence of consensus, including, but not limited to, the record of the Dungeness crab task force, the program shall include all of the following requirements:

(1) The program shall contain seven tiers of Dungeness crab trap limits based on California landings receipts under California permits between November 15, 2003, and July 15, 2008, as follows:

(A) The 55 California permits with the highest California landings shall receive a maximum allocation of 500 trap tags.

(B) The 55 California permits with the next highest California landings to those in subparagraph (A) shall receive a maximum allocation of 450 trap tags.

(C) The 55 California permits with the next highest California landings to those in subparagraph (B) shall receive a maximum allocation of 400 trap tags.

(D) The 55 California permits with the next highest California landings to those in subparagraph (C) shall receive a maximum allocation of 350 trap tags.

(E) The 55 California permits with the next highest California landings to those in subparagraph (D) shall receive a maximum allocation of 300 trap tags.

(F) The remaining California permits with the next highest California landings to those in subparagraph (E), which are not described in paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (i) of Section 8276.4, shall receive a maximum allocation of 250 trap tags.

(G) The California permits described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (i) of Section 8276.4 shall receive a maximum allocation of 175 trap tags. The trap tags in this tier shall not be transferable for the first two years of the program.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the director shall not remove a permitholder from a tier described in paragraph (1), if, after an allocation is made pursuant to paragraph (1), an appeal pursuant to paragraph (8) places a permitholder in a tier different than the original allocation.

(3) Participants in the program shall meet all of the following requirements:

(A) Unless a participant receives a waiver pursuant to paragraph (4), pay a biennial fee for each trap tag issued pursuant to this section to pay the pro rata share of costs of the program, including, but not limited to, informing permitholders of the program, collecting fees, acquiring and sending trap tags to permitholders, paying for a portion of enforcement costs, and monitoring the results of the program. The fee shall not exceed five dollars ($5) per trap, per two-year period. All of the trap tags allocated to each permit pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be purchased by the permitholder or the permit shall be void.

(B) Purchase a biennial crab trap limit permit of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per two-year period to pay for the department’s reasonable regulatory costs.

(C) Not lease a crab trap tag, and transfer a tag only as part of a transaction to purchase a California permitted crab vessel.

(D) A Dungeness crab trap that is fished shall contain a trap tag that is fastened to the main buoy, and an additional tag provided by the permitholder attached to the trap. The department shall mandate the information that is required to appear on both buoy and trap tags.

(4) The department shall issue a participant a waiver from the biennial fee for each trap tag described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (3) if the participant is unable to fish due to mandatory military service and the participant submits a request for a waiver to the department at the same time that the participant renews the permit issued pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3). A participant who receives a waiver pursuant to this paragraph shall not apply to the department to fish for Dungeness crab during the first year of the waiver, but may apply to fish for Dungeness crab during the second year of the waiver if the participant pays the full cost of the biennial fee for each trap tag. The department shall not limit the number of times a participant may request a waiver.

(5) Notwithstanding subparagraph (D) of paragraph (3), a vessel may transit state waters with Dungeness crab traps that are not tagged pursuant to subparagraph (D) of paragraph (3) if the traps contain either a valid Oregon or Washington trap tag, no crab species are onboard the vessel, and the traps are not deployed in state waters.

(6) The department shall annually provide an accounting of all costs associated with the crab trap limit program. The department shall use excess funds collected to reduce the cost of the crab trap limit permit fee or tag fee in subsequent years of the program.

(7) Permitholders may replace lost tags by application to the department and payment of a fee not to exceed the reasonable costs incurred by the department. The department may waive or reduce a fee in the case of catastrophic loss of tags.

(8) Any Dungeness crab permitholder may submit to the director an appeal of a trap tag allocation received pursuant to this section, by March 31, 2014, on a permit-by-permit basis for the purpose of revising upward or downward any trap tag allocation. Any appeal to revise upward a trap tag allocation shall be based on evidence that a permit’s California landings during the period between November 15, 2003, and July 15, 2008, inclusive, were reduced as a result of unusual circumstances and that these circumstances constitute an unfair hardship, taking into account the overall California landings history as indicated by landing receipts associated with the permit. The director shall initiate the appeal process within 12 months of receiving an appeal request. The appeal shall be heard and decided by an administrative law judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings, whose decision shall constitute the final administrative decision. Except as provided in subparagraph (B), any Dungeness crab permitholder requesting an appeal to revise upward the permitholder’s trap tag allocation shall pay all expenses, including a nonrefundable filing fee, as determined by the department, to pay for the department’s reasonable costs associated with the appeal process described in this paragraph.

(b) (1) In addition to criminal penalties authorized by law, a violation of the requirements of the program created pursuant to this section shall be subject to the following civil penalties:

(A) Conviction of a first offense shall result in a fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250) and not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per illegal trap or fraudulent tag.

(B) Conviction of a second offense shall result in a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500) and not more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) per illegal trap or fraudulent tag, and the permit may be suspended for one year.

(C) Conviction of a third offense shall result in a fine of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) and not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) per illegal trap or fraudulent tag, and the permit may be permanently revoked.

(2) The severity of a penalty within the ranges described in this subdivision shall be based on a determination whether the violation was willful or negligent and other factors.

(3) The portion of monetary judgments for noncompliance that are paid to the department shall be deposited in the Dungeness Crab Account created pursuant to subdivision (e).

(c) For the purposes of this section, a proposed recommendation that receives an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the voting members of the Dungeness crab task force may be transmitted to the director or the Legislature as a recommendation, shall be considered to be the consensus of the task force, and shall be considered to be evidence of consensus in the Dungeness crab industry. Any proposed recommendation that does not receive a vote sufficient to authorize transmittal to the director or Legislature as a recommendation shall be evidence of a lack of consensus by the Dungeness crab task force, and shall be considered to be evidence of a lack of consensus in the crab industry.

(d) The director may modify the program adopted pursuant to subdivision (a), if consistent with the requirements of this section, after consultation with the Dungeness crab task force or its representatives and after the task force has had 60 days or more to review the proposed modifications and recommend any proposed changes. The director may implement the modifications earlier than 60 days after it is sent to the Dungeness crab task force for review, if recommended by the task force.

(e) The Dungeness Crab Account is hereby established in the Fish and Game Preservation Fund and the fees collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in that account. The money in the account shall be used as follows:

(1) By the department, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for administering and enforcing the program.

(2) In each fiscal year through the 2029 fiscal year, upon appropriation by the Legislature, of the amount remaining in the account after an allocation pursuant to paragraph (1), the sum of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000), if available, shall be allocated to the council to support the administration and facilitation of the Dungeness crab task force.

(f) For purposes of meeting the necessary expenses of initial organization and operation of the program until fees may be collected, or other funding sources may be received, the department may borrow money as needed for these expenses from the council. The borrowed money shall be repaid within one year from the fees collected or other funding sources received. The council shall give high priority to providing funds or services to the department, in addition to loans, to assist in the development of the program, including, but not limited to, the costs of convening the Dungeness crab task force, environmental review, and the department’s costs of attending meetings with task force members.

(g) (1) It is the intent of the Legislature that the department, the council, and the Dungeness crab task force work with the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Commission to resolve any issues pertaining to moving the fair start line south to the border of California and Mexico.

(2) For purposes of this subdivision, the resolution of issues pertaining to the fair start line shall be limited to assessing the positive and negative implications of including District 10 in the tri-state agreement, including working with the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Commission to amend Oregon and Washington laws to include District 10 in the regular season fair start clause, and discussion of providing different rules for District 10 with regard to preseason quality testing.

##### ARTICLE 9.7. Market Squid [8420 - 8429.7]  

######### 8420.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares that the fishery for market squid (Loligo opalescens) is the state’s largest fishery by volume, generating millions of dollars of income to the state annually from domestic and foreign sales.  In addition to supporting an important commercial fishery, the market squid resource is important to the recreational fishery and is forage for other fish taken for commercial and recreational purposes, as well as for marine mammals, birds, and other marine life.  The growing international market for squid and declining squid production from other parts of the world has resulted in an increased demand for California market squid, which, in turn, has led to newer, larger, and more efficient vessels entering the fishery and increased processing capacity.

(b) The Legislature finds that the lack of research on market squid and the lack of annual at-sea surveys to determine the status of the resource, combined with the increased demand for, and fishing effort on, market squid could result in overfishing of the resource, damaging the resource, and financially harming those persons engaged in the taking, landing, processing, and sale of market squid.

(c) The Legislature further finds that some individuals, vessels, and processing plants engaged in the market squid fishery have no other viable alternative fisheries available to them and that a decline or a loss of the market squid resource would cause economic devastation to the individuals or corporations engaged in the market squid fishery.

(d) The Legislature declares that to prevent excessive fishing effort in the market squid fishery and to develop a plan for the sustainable harvest of market squid, it is necessary to  adopt and implement a fishery management plan for the California market squid fishery that sustains both the squid population and the marine life that depends on squid.

(e) The Legislature finds that a sustainable California market squid fishery can best be ensured through ongoing oversight and management of the fishery by the commission.  With regard to the market squid fishery, the Legislature urges that any limited entry component of a fishery management plan, if necessary, should be adopted for the primary purpose of protecting the resource and not simply for the purpose of diminishing or advancing the economic interests of any particular individual or group.



######### 8424.  
(a) No person shall purchase squid from a vessel or vessels unless that person holds a license issued pursuant to Section 8032 or 8033, employs a certified weighmaster, and the facilities operated by the person are located on a permanent, fixed location.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this section shall not apply to the transfer at sea of squid for live bait in an amount less than 200 pounds in a calendar day.



######### 8425.  
(a) On or before December 31, 2002, the commission, after consideration of the report and recommendations prepared by the department pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 8426, and, after public hearings, shall adopt a market squid fishery management plan and regulations to protect the squid resource and manage the squid fishery at a level that sustains healthy squid populations, taking into account the level of fishing effort and ecological factors, including, but not limited to, the species’ role in the marine ecosystem and oceanic conditions.  The management plan shall be consistent with the requirements of Part 1.7 (commencing with Section 7050).  Development of the plan shall be coordinated with the federal Coastal Pelagic Species Fishery Management Plan.

(b) On and after January 1, 2002, the commission shall manage the squid fishery in accordance with the requirements of Part 1.7 (commencing with Section 7050).



######### 8428.  
Commencing April 1, 2003, and annually thereafter, the fees for a commercial market squid vessel permit and for a commercial squid light boat owner’s permit shall be established by the commission.  The total amount of fees collected pursuant to this section, including any revenue derived from any other appropriate source, as determined and allocated by the commission, shall not exceed the department’s and the commission’s costs for managing the market squid fishery pursuant to Section 8425.  The fees collected pursuant to this article shall be used only for the management of the market squid fishery pursuant to Section 8425.



######### 8429.  
Any statement made to the department, orally or in writing, relating to a permit issued under this article, shall be made under penalty of perjury.  The commission shall revoke the commercial fishing license, the commercial boat registration of any vessel, and, if applicable, any licenses issued pursuant to Section 8032, 8033, or 8034 that are held by any person submitting material false statements, as determined by the commission, for the purpose of obtaining a commercial market squid vessel permit or a commercial light boat owner’s permit.



######### 8429.5.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, nothing in this article shall prohibit or otherwise limit the authority of the director or the commission under any other law.



######### 8429.7.  
Sections 8420.5 to 8423.5, inclusive, and Sections 8426 and 8427 shall become inoperative upon the adoption by the commission of a market squid fishery management plan and the adoption of implementing regulations pursuant to Section 8425, and are repealed six months thereafter.

##### ARTICLE 17. Nearshore Fisheries Management Act [8585 - 8589.7]  

######### 8585.  
This article shall be known and may be cited as the Nearshore Fisheries Management Act.



######### 8585.5.  
The Legislature finds and declares that important commercial and recreational fisheries exist on numerous stocks of rockfish (genus Sebastes), California sheephead (genus Semicossyphus), kelp greenling (genus Hexagrammos), cabezon (genus Scorpaenichthys), and scorpionfish (genus Scorpaena), in the nearshore state waters extending from the shore to one nautical mile offshore the California coast, that there is increasing pressure being placed on these fish from recreational and commercial fisheries, that many of these fish species found in the nearshore waters are slow growing and long lived, and that, if depleted, many of these species may take decades to rebuild. The Legislature further finds and declares that, although extensive research has been conducted on some of these species by state and federal governments, there are many gaps in the information on these species and their habitats and that there is no program currently adequate for the systematic research, conservation, and management of nearshore fish stocks and the sustainable activity of recreational and commercial nearshore fisheries. The Legislature further finds and declares that recreational fishing in California generates funds pursuant to the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. Secs. 777 to 777l, inclusive), with revenues used for, among other things, research, conservation, and management of nearshore fish. The Legislature further finds and declares that a program for research and conservation of nearshore fish species and their habitats is needed, and that a management program for the nearshore fisheries is necessary. The Legislature further finds and declares that the commission should be granted additional authority to regulate the commercial and recreational fisheries to assure the sustainable populations of nearshore fish stocks. Lastly, the Legislature finds and declares that, whenever feasible and practicable, it is the policy of the state to assure sustainable commercial and recreational nearshore fisheries, to protect recreational opportunities, and to assure long-term employment in commercial and recreational fisheries.

##### ARTICLE 1.5. Development of Alternative Fishing Gear [8614 - 8615]  

######### 8614.  
(a) If an experimental permit is revoked or not renewed, pursuant to a judgment, a decision of the commission, or a legislative enactment, and the permittee has an outstanding loan with the State Coastal Conservancy under Section 31125 of the Public Resources Code, as added by Chapter 910 of the Statutes of 1986, for the purchase of alternative fishing gear, the unpaid balance of the loan shall be excused from the date of revocation or nonrenewal of the permit, or from the date of any judgment, decision, or enactment which terminates the permit, if the permittee relinquishes the permit and returns the collateral fishing gear to the department, in which case the department shall take possession of the alternative fishing gear for the State Coastal Conservancy.  Any alternative gear received by the department due to a revocation, nonrenewal, or termination of an experimental permit may be resold by the State Coastal Conservancy at fair market value to other experimental permit applicants or holders under this article.  If the permittee chooses to keep the alternative gear and repay the loan, the rate of interest shall be reduced to 3 percent for the remaining balance of the loan.

(b) If the Legislature approves the permanent use or type of gear and the commercial fishing permit or the license for the permanent use or type of gear is revoked for a violation of the terms and conditions under which the fishery is conducted, the permittee shall be responsible for any remaining balance on any outstanding loan with the State Coastal Conservancy for the purchase of alternative fishing gear.



######### 8615.  
(a) (1) Within the first six months of operation pursuant to an experimental permit and after a reasonable and concerted effort to utilize a new type of commercial fishing gear, the permittee may request that the experimental permit be terminated if it is economically infeasible to harvest the target species or if the alternative gear is impractical, inefficient, or ineffective within the fishery or regional area selected. The permittee shall submit copies of all landing receipts, a financial statement setting forth the expenses and any revenue generated by the operation of the alternative fishing gear, and a brief summary from any observers, monitors, and employees regarding the operation of the alternative fishing gear to the department. The department shall review the permittee’s submitted material.

(2) If the submitted material supports the claim that the new type of commercial fishing gear utilized by the permittee was either inefficient, impractical, or ineffective, or that it was not economically feasible for the permittee to harvest the target species, the department shall terminate the experimental permit and submit its findings to the State Coastal Conservancy. Upon receiving the department’s report, the State Coastal Conservancy may terminate the permittee’s loan. If the permittee returns the collateral fishing gear to the department, the State Coastal Conservancy shall reimburse the permittee from the loan fund for the principal amount of the loan repaid by the permittee. The department shall take possession of the fishing gear for the State Coastal Conservancy, which may resell the gear as set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 8614.

(3) If the information does not support the claim made by the permittee, the department may still terminate the experimental permit. The State Coastal Conservancy may terminate the remaining balance on the loan if the permittee returns the collateral fishing gear to the department, but the State Coastal Conservancy shall not reimburse the permittee for previous loan payments.

(b) After six months of operation pursuant to an experimental permit, any request to terminate the permit for the reasons set forth in subdivision (a) shall include, in addition to the information required by paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), an explanation of the changed circumstances or reasons that cause the new type of gear to become inefficient, impractical, or ineffective or economically infeasible to harvest the target species after the initial six-month operating period. The department shall review the request and make its recommendation to the State Coastal Conservancy following the procedures set forth in subdivision (a). If the department terminates the experimental gear permit, the State Coastal Conservancy may terminate the remaining balance on the loan if the permittee returns the collateral fishing gear to the department, but it shall not reimburse the permittee for any loan payments received. The department shall take possession of the alternative fishing gear for the State Coastal Conservancy, which may resell the gear as set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 8614.

######### 8625.  
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this code, set gill nets and trammel nets with mesh size of not less than 8<font size="2"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches may be used to take California halibut.

(b) Except as provided in subdivision (c), not more than 1,500 fathoms (9,000 feet) of gill net or trammel net shall be fished in combination each day for California halibut from any vessel in ocean waters.

(c) Not more than 1,000 fathoms (6,000 feet) of gill net or trammel net shall be fished in combination each day for California halibut from any vessel in ocean waters between a line extending due west magnetic from Point Arguello in Santa Barbara County and a line extending 172° magnetic from Rincon Point in Santa Barbara County to San Pedro Point at the east end of Santa Cruz Island in Santa Barbara County, then extending southwesterly 188° magnetic from San Pedro Point on Santa Cruz Island.

(d) This section shall become operative on August 15, 1989.



######### 8626.  
(a) Notwithstanding Section 8625, and where consistent with the determination made pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c), the director may reduce the minimum mesh size permitted for gill and trammel nets used to take California halibut from 8<font size="2"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches to not less than 8 inches in any or all areas south of a line extending 240° magnetic from the boundary line between the Counties of Los Angeles and Ventura.

(b) If, on or before October 1, 1990, the department determines that commercial landings of California halibut taken south of the line extending 240° magnetic from the boundary line between the Counties of Los Angeles and Ventura in the period between September 1, 1989, and August 31, 1990, decline by 10 percent or more compared with landings of California halibut taken in this area during the period between September 1, 1988, and August 31, 1989, the department shall assess the impact of the 8<font size="2"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch minimum mesh size restriction on the California halibut fishery in the area described in subdivision (a).  The assessment shall include, but is not limited to, an analysis of landing data, including landings of California halibut in Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego Counties, the age and size composition of the catch, and the department’s monitoring at sea of the gill and trammel net fishery.

(c) If the department determines that the 8<font size="2"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch minimum mesh size, established pursuant to Section 8625 has directly resulted in a decline of 10 percent or more in landings of California halibut south of the line extending 240° magnetic from the boundary between the Counties of Los Angeles and Ventura, the director shall hold a public hearing in the area affected to make findings and take public testimony prior to taking any action pursuant to subdivision (a).

(d) This section shall become operative on August 15, 1989.









##### ARTICLE 3. Seizure [8630 - 8635]  

######### 8630.  
Any net or trap used for taking fish in violation of the provisions of this code is a public nuisance. It is the duty of every person authorized to make an arrest for such a violation to seize and keep the net and report the seizure to the department.

The department may commence proceedings in the superior court of the county or city and county in which the seizure is made by petitioning the court for a judgment forfeiting the net.  Upon the filing of the petition, the clerk of the court shall fix a time for a hearing and cause notices to be posted for 14 days in at least three public places in the place where the court is held, setting forth the substance of the petition and the time and place fixed for its hearing.  At that time, the court shall hear and determine the proceeding and, upon proof that the net was used in violation of this code shall order it forfeited.  Any net so forfeited shall be sold or destroyed by the department.  The proceeds from all those sales shall be paid into the Fish and Game Preservation Fund.



######### 8631.  
In lieu of a physical seizure pursuant to this article, any person authorized to make an arrest for a violation of any provision of this code, may attach to any net used for taking fish in violation of this code a tag of metal or other material, which shall be adopted by the department for this purpose and furnished to such person. The tag shall be impressed or printed with language stating that the net to which it is attached is thereby seized by the department as a public nuisance. The act of attaching such tag shall be a seizure within the meaning of this section.

Removal of a tag attached to any net pursuant to this section by any person other than a person authorized by the department, or the use of any such net by any person for fishing purposes, unless authorized by the department or by the superior court, is a misdemeanor.



######### 8632.  
Within three days after the department has been notified in writing that a vessel carrying a seized net has arrived in port, the department may remove the net from the vessel, unless the owner has furnished a bond in accordance with Section 8633. The notice shall be sufficient when delivered to the office of the department nearest to the port at which the vessel has arrived.



######### 8633.  
When any net is seized pursuant to this article, the owner or any other person otherwise entitled to possession of the net may apply to the superior court of the county or city and county in which the seizure was made, or the county or city and county of which the claimant is a resident, for leave to file a bond and regain possession of the net during the pendency of the proceedings. The bond shall be in an amount determined by the judge to be the actual value of the net at the time of its release. It shall be filed within three days after the seizure of the net, and shall be conditioned upon the return of the net to the custody of the department in the event the net is ordered forfeited. Upon filing the bond, the person on whose behalf it is given shall be put in possession of the net and may use the net until it is finally ordered delivered up and forfeited, if such be the judgment of the court.



######### 8634.  
When any net is seized pursuant to this article and the owner or any other person otherwise entitled to possession of the net has filed a bond and regained possession of the net, the person in possession of the net, when in the judgment of the court the net is ordered forfeited, shall deliver the net to the department by removing the net from the boat and placing in a warehouse or storage designated by the department.



######### 8635.  
(a) Notwithstanding Section 8633, any net or trap seized pursuant to Section 8630 as illegal because of its size, manner of construction, materials used in its construction, or configuration of its parts is presumed to be contraband and shall not be returned pending forfeiture unless it can be and is modified to eliminate the condition of illegality. This subdivision does not apply to any net or trap seized pursuant to Section 8630 for illegal use.

(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), any net or trap seized pursuant to Section 8630 that is needed for evidence may be held for evidence.









##### ARTICLE 4. Nets Generally in Particular Districts [8660 - 8670]  

######### 8660.  
Nothing in this chapter authorizing the use of nets in District 19 or 19A shall authorize the use of any net within 750 feet of any pier, wharf, jetty, or breakwater, except that dip nets may be used subject to the provisions of Section 8870.

######### 8664.  
Except in Districts 6 and 7, any net found in, or within 500 feet of the Klamath, Smith, Eel, Mad, Van Dusen, or Mattole Rivers, or their tributaries, is prima facie evidence that the owner or person in possession of the net is or has been using it unlawfully.

The provisions of this section do not apply to trawl or drag nets being transported.



######### 8664.5.  
(a) Notwithstanding Sections 8693 and 8724, gill nets and trammel nets shall not be used in those portions of District 17 between a line extending 220° magnetic from the mouth of Waddell Creek in Santa Cruz County and a line extending 252° magnetic from Yankee Point, Carmel Highlands, in Monterey County in waters 30 fathoms or less in depth at mean lower low water.

(b) Notwithstanding Sections 8693 and 8724, gill nets and trammel nets shall not be used in that portion of District 18 north of a line extending due west from Point Sal in Santa Barbara County in waters 30 fathoms or less in depth at mean lower low water.

(2) The person shall give adequate notification, as determined by the department, to the department at its office in Monterey or Morro Bay at least 24 hours prior to each fishing trip to ensure full compliance and cooperation with the monitoring program. The department may require that an authorized monitor be on board the vessel. The department shall determine whether on board, at sea, or shoreside monitoring is appropriate. If the authorized monitor is not on board the fishing vessel, the fishing vessel operator and the authorized monitor shall make every effort to remain in radio contact if the radio equipment is made available to the monitor.

(3) To ensure the effectiveness of the monitoring program, gill nets and trammel nets may be set or pulled only between one-half hour after sunrise and one-half hour before sunset.

(4) A permit may be revoked and canceled pursuant to Section 8681 for failure to comply with the department’s notification and monitoring requirements.

(d) If the director determines that the use of gill or trammel nets is having an adverse impact on any population of any species of seabird, marine mammal, or fish, the director shall issue an order prohibiting or restricting the use, method of use, size, or materials used in the construction of either or both types of those nets in all or any part of District 10 or 17, or in all or any part of District 18 north of a line extending due west from Point Conception in Santa Barbara County for a specified period. The order shall take effect no later than 48 hours after its issuance. The director shall hold a properly noticed public hearing in a place convenient to the affected area within one week of the effective date of the order to describe the action taken and shall take testimony as to the effect of the order and determine whether any modification of the order is necessary.

(e) For purposes of this section, “adverse impact” means either of the following:

(1) The danger of irreparable injury to, or mortality in, any population of any species of seabird, marine mammal, or fish which is occurring at a rate that threatens the viability of the population as a direct result of the use of gill nets or trammel nets.

(2) The impairment of the recovery of a species listed as an endangered species or threatened species pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. Sec. 1531 et seq.) or the California Endangered Species Act (Chapter 1.5 (commencing with Section 2050) of Division 3) or a species of seabird, marine mammal, or fish designated as fully protected under this code, as a direct result of the use of gill nets or trammel nets.

(f) This section does not apply to any gill net with meshes 3<font size="2"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches or less in length in any portion of District 18 between Yankee Point in Monterey County and Point Sal in Santa Barbara County.

(g)  The Legislature finds and declares that this section, as amended by Chapter 884 of the Statutes of 1990, and as amended by the act that amended this section during the 1992 portion of the 1991–92 Regular Session, is more restrictive on the use and possession of gill nets and trammel nets than the version of this section in effect on January 1, 1990, and therefore complies with Section 8610.4, and Section 4 of Article X B of the California Constitution.



######### 8664.67.  
“Impacted fisherman” for purposes of Sections 8664.5 and 8664.65, means any person who, from January 1, 1986, to December 31, 1990, inclusive, landed a minimum of 1,000 pounds of fish, other than shark or rockfish, in each of at least three calendar years during that period with set gill and trammel nets and landed the fish at ports within areas subject to gill and trammel net closures pursuant to Section 8664.5. Landings shall be verified by the fisherman’s submittal of landing receipts as provided in Section 8043.



######### 8664.7.  
The initial period of effectiveness of an order issued pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 8664.5 shall not exceed 120 days. After a further public hearing, the director may, on the basis of a report prepared by the department on the condition of the local population of any species of seabird, marine mammal, or fish, extend the order for a further specified period or reissue the order for a further specified period.



######### 8664.8.

The Legislature finds and declares that:

(a) Poaching violations and other violations of the Fish and Game Code have been increasing, and these violations have a detrimental impact on fish and wildlife and their habitats, which are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the people of the state.

(c) The department, to the extent feasible and subject to available resources, shall establish and coordinate an environmental crimes task force. The task force should involve the participation of the department’s Office of General Counsel working with each of the department’s law enforcement districts. The task force may include coordination with representatives from the California District Attorneys’ Association, the Judicial Council, the Attorney General’s office, and the University of California.

(2) The remediation of existing cannabis cultivation sites is often complex and the permitting of these sites requires greater department staff time and personnel expenditures. The potential for cannabis cultivation sites to significantly impact the state’s fish and wildlife resources requires immediate action on the part of the department’s lake and streambed alteration permitting staff.

######### 12150.  
Whenever any person, while taking a bird or mammal, kills or wounds any human being and that fact is ascertained by the department, the department shall notify the district attorney of the county in which the act occurred.  The district attorney may thereupon bring an action in the superior court of the county in which the act occurred for the purpose of determining the cause of the killing or the wounding.  These proceedings shall be conducted in the same manner as an action to try a misdemeanor and the defendant may request that all findings of fact shall be made by a jury.  The court shall inform the defendant of the nature of the proceedings and of the defendant’s right to have a jury.

If it is found that the defendant did the killing or wounding, but that it was not intentional or negligent, the court shall dismiss the proceeding. Otherwise, if it is found that the defendant did the killing or wounding intentionally, by an act of gross negligence, or while under the influence of alcohol, the court shall issue an order permanently prohibiting the defendant from taking any bird or mammal.

If it is found that the defendant was negligent, but not grossly negligent, the court shall issue an order prohibiting the defendant from taking any bird or mammal for a period specified at the discretion of the court but not less than five years.



######### 12150.5.  
Any person whose license has heretofore been revoked pursuant to Section 12150 may, upon petition, obtain a new trial in the court which originally revoked his license. Such trial shall be with a jury if requested as provided in Section 12150, and shall be to determine if the revocation was based on an intentional or grossly negligent act or an act committed while under the influence of alcohol, in which case the petition shall be denied. If however, it was based on a negligent act not amounting to gross negligence the court may review and redetermine the length of time for which no license should be issued such person. The court may authorize the issuance of a license to the person after such time as the court shall determine to be proper in light of the circumstances.



######### 12150.6.  
(a) Any person who has been prohibited from taking any bird or mammal pursuant to Section 12150 or 12151 shall not apply for a hunting license or take any bird or mammal unless the person has filed with the department proof of ability to respond in damages in an amount of at least ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for personal injury or death of any person, subject to a maximum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) for such injury or the death of two or more persons in any one accident and at least five thousand dollars ($5,000) for property damage resulting from any one accident.

The certificate shall certify that the policy therein cited shall not be canceled except upon 10 days’ prior written notice to the department.

(2) A bond in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) approved by a judge of a court of record.  The bond shall be conditioned for the payment of the amounts specified in this section and shall provide for the entry of judgment on motion of the state in favor of any holder of any final judgment on account of damages to property or injury to any person caused while the licensee is taking any bird or mammal.



######### 12150.7.  
The department shall, upon request, cancel any bond or shall direct the return to the person entitled thereto of any money or securities deposited pursuant to this code as proof of ability to respond in damages:

(a) On the filing of an affidavit with the department that the person will not thereafter engage in the taking of any bird or mammal.

(b) In the event of the permanent incapacity of such person to engage in the taking of any bird or mammal.

(c) Upon the death of the person on whose behalf such proof was filed.



######### 12150.8.  
Whenever any claim is made against any such person or judgment is rendered against any such person required to file proof of ability to respond in damages, such person shall not apply for a hunting license or take any bird or mammal until additional proof of ability to respond in damages has been filed with the department in an amount sufficient to provide proof of ability to respond in damages in the amount specified in Section 12150.6 over and above all claims made against previously filed proof of ability to respond in damages.



######### 12151.  
Whenever any person, while taking a bird or mammal, kills or wounds any domestic animal belonging to another and that fact is ascertained by the department, the department shall notify the district attorney of the county in which the act occurred.  The district attorney may thereupon bring an action in the superior court of the county in which the act occurred for the purpose of determining the cause of the killing or wounding.  These proceedings shall be conducted in the same manner as an action to try a misdemeanor and the defendant may request that all findings of fact shall be made by a jury.  The court shall inform the defendant of the nature of the proceedings and of the defendant’s right to have a jury.

If it is found that the defendant did the killing or wounding but that it was not intentional or negligent, the court shall dismiss the proceeding. Otherwise, if it is found that the defendant did the killing or wounding intentionally or negligently, the court shall issue an order prohibiting the defendant from taking any bird or mammal for a period of five years.



######### 12151.5.  
A person who, while hunting, kills or wounds or witnesses the killing or wounding of a human being, or domestic animal belonging to another, shall, within 48 hours after the incident, forward a complete written report to the Department of Fish and Wildlife, 1416 Ninth Street, Sacramento, California 95814, providing the reporter’s full name and address and all facts relating to the incident.

Whenever a person has been prohibited from taking any bird or mammal pursuant to Section 12150 or Section 12151, the court in which the proceeding for such action was had shall report the facts to the department at its Sacramento headquarters office. The report shall show the date and place of the occurrence, the name and address of the person who did the killing or wounding, the name and address of the person who was killed or wounded or the name and address of the owner of the animal, as the case may be, and such other information as the department may require.

The department shall maintain a record of all orders issued under Section 12150 and Section 12151.  The record shall show the name and address of the person involved, the date of such action, and the date of expiration of such order.  The department shall periodically transmit copies of such records to each person authorized to issue a hunting license and to each district attorney in the State.

(c) After a public hearing at which the person has appeared in person, the commission may terminate the prohibition and authorize the issuance of a license if it finds that there are sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant that action.

(d) It is unlawful for a person whose hunting or sport fishing privileges have been revoked or suspended to obtain or attempt to obtain, or to possess a hunting or sport fishing license, permit, or tag during that suspension or revocation period.

The court shall impose lesser forfeiture penalties under this subdivision for those acts that have little significant effect upon natural resources or the property of another and greater forfeiture penalties for those acts that may cause serious injury to natural resources or the property of another, as determined by the court. In determining whether or not to order forfeiture of a vehicle, the court shall, in addition to any other relevant factor, consider whether the defendant is the owner of the vehicle and whether the owner of the vehicle had knowledge of the violation.

(3) It is the intent of the Legislature that forfeiture not be ordered pursuant to this subdivision for minor or inadvertent violations, as determined by the court.

(h) For purposes of this section, a plea of nolo contendere or no contest, or forfeiture of bail, constitutes a conviction.

(i) Neither the disposition of the criminal action other than by conviction nor the discretionary refusal of the judge to order forfeiture upon conviction impairs the right of the department to commence proceedings to order the forfeiture of fish nets or traps pursuant to Section 8630.



######### 12157.5.  
The judge before whom any person is tried and convicted of violating Sections 2004 and 2016 and, at the same proceeding, is also tried and convicted of violating Section 2001 or 2005 may, in his discretion, order the forfeiture of any motor vehicle or snowmobile used in committing one or more of the offenses charged.

######### 14001.  
The form and contents of the Pacific Marine Fisheries Compact shall be substantially as provided in this section and the effect of its provisions shall be interpreted and administered in conformity with the provisions of this division: 

Pacific Marine Fisheries Compact

The contracting states do hereby agree as follows: 

Article I

The purposes of this compact are and shall be to promote the better utilization of fisheries, marine, shell and anadromous, which are of mutual concern, and to develop a joint program of protection and prevention of physical waste of such fisheries in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean over which the compacting states jointly or separately now have or may hereafter acquire jurisdiction.

Nothing herein contained shall be construed so as to authorize the compacting states or any of them to limit the production of fish or fish products for the purpose of establishing or fixing the prices thereof or creating and perpetuating a monopoly. 

Article II

This agreement shall become operative immediately as to those states executing it in the form that is in accordance with the laws of the executing state and when the Congress has given its consent. 

Article III

Each state joining herein shall appoint, as determined by state statutes, one or more representatives to a commission hereby constituted and designated as the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, of whom one shall be the administrative or other officer of the agency of such state charged with the conservation of the fisheries resources to which this compact pertains. This commission shall be invested with the powers and duties set forth herein.

The term of each commissioner of the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission shall be four years. A commissioner shall hold office until his successor shall be appointed and qualified but such successor’s term shall expire four years from legal date of expiration of the term of his predecessor. Vacancies occurring in the office of such commissioner from any reason or cause shall be filled for the unexpired term, or a commissioner may be removed from office, as provided by the statutes of the state concerned. Each commissioner may delegate in writing from time to time, to a deputy, the power to be present and participate, including voting as his representative or substitute, at any meeting of or hearing by or other proceeding of the commission.

Voting powers under this compact shall be limited to one vote for each state regardless of the number of representatives. 

Article IV

The duty of the said commission shall be to make inquiry and ascertain from time to time such methods, practices, circumstances and conditions as may be disclosed for bringing about the conservation and the prevention of the depletion and physical waste of the fisheries, marine, shell, and anadromous in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean over which the states signatory to this compact jointly or separately now have or may hereafter acquire jurisdiction. The commission shall have power to recommend the coordination of the exercise of the police powers of the several states within their respective jurisdictions and said conservation zones to promote the preservation of those fisheries and their protection against overfishing, waste, depletion or any abuse whatsoever and to assure a continuing yield from the fisheries resources of the signatory parties hereto.

To that end the commission shall draft and, after consultation with the advisory committee hereinafter authorized, recommend to the governors and legislative branches of the various signatory states hereto legislation dealing with the conservation of the marine, shell, and anadromous fisheries in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean over which the states signatory to this compact jointly or separately now have or may hereafter acquire jurisdiction. The commission shall, more than one month prior to any regular meeting of the legislative branch in any state signatory hereto, present to the governor of such state its recommendations relating to enactments by the legislative branch of that state in furthering the intents and purposes of this compact.

The commission shall consult with and advise the pertinent administrative agencies in the signatory states with regard to problems connected with the fisheries and recommend the adoption of such regulations as it deems advisable and which lie within the jurisdiction of such agencies.

The commission shall have power to recommend to the states signatory hereto the stocking of the waters of such states with marine, shell or anadromous fish and fish eggs or joint stocking by some or all of such states and when two or more of the said states shall jointly stock waters the commission shall act as the coordinating agency for such stocking. 

Article V

The commission shall elect from its number a chairman and a vice chairman and shall appoint and at its pleasure remove or discharge such officers and employees as may be required to carry the provisions of this compact into effect and shall fix and determine their duties, qualifications and compensation. Said commission shall adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of its business. It may establish and maintain one or more offices for the transaction of its business and may meet at any time or place within the territorial limits of the signatory states but must meet at least once a year. 

Article VI

No action shall be taken by the commission except by the affirmative vote of a majority of the whole number of compacting states represented at any meeting. No recommendation shall be made by the commission in regard to any species of fish except by the vote of a majority of the compacting states which have an interest in such species. 

Article VII

The fisheries research agencies of the signatory states shall act in collaboration as the official research agency of the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission.

An advisory committee to be representative of the commercial fishermen, commercial fishing industry and such other interests of each state as the commission deems advisable shall be established by the commission as soon as practicable for the purpose of advising the commission upon such recommendations as it may desire to make. 

Article VIII

Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit the powers of any state or to repeal or prevent the enactment of any legislation or the enforcement of any requirement by any state imposing additional conditions and restrictions to conserve its fisheries. 

Article IX

Continued absence of representation or of any representative on the commission from any state party hereto, shall be brought to the attention of the governor thereof. 

Article X

The states agree to make available annual funds for the support of the commission on the following basis:

Eighty percent of the annual budget shall be shared equally by those member states having as a boundary the Pacific Ocean. Not less than 5 percent of the annual budget shall be contributed by any other member state. The balance of the annual budget shall be shared by those member states having as a boundary the Pacific Ocean, in proportion to the primary market value of the products of their commercial fisheries on the basis of the latest five-year catch records.

The annual contribution of each member state shall be figured to the nearest one hundred dollars ($100). 

Article XI

This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each state until renounced by it. Renunciation of this compact must be preceded by sending six months’ notice in writing of intention to withdraw from the compact to the other parties hereto. 

Article XII

Hawaii or any other state having rivers or streams tributary to the Pacific Ocean may become a contracting state by enactment of the Pacific Marine Fisheries Compact. Upon admission of any new state to the compact, the purposes of the compact and the duties of the commission shall extend to the development of joint programs for the conservation, protection and prevention of physical waste of fisheries in which the contracting states are mutually concerned and to all waters of the newly admitted state necessary to develop such programs.

This compact shall become effective upon its enactment by the states signatory to this compact and upon ratification by Congress by virtue of the authority vested in it under Article 1, Section 10, of the Constitution of the United States.

Where feasible, alternatives to fish meal and fish oil, or fish meal and fish oil made from seafood harvesting byproducts, shall be utilized, taking into account factors that include, but need not be limited to, the nutritional needs of the fish being raised and the availability of alternative ingredients.

(4) Lessees shall establish best management practices, approved by the commission, for each lease site. Approved best management practices shall include a regular monitoring, reporting, and site inspection program that requires at least annual monitoring of lease sites to ensure that the operations are in compliance with best management practices related to fish disease, escapement, and environmental stewardship, and that operations are meeting the requirements of this section. The commission may remove fish stocks, close facilities, or terminate the lease if it finds that the lessee is not in compliance with best management practices, that the lessee’s activities have damaged or are damaging the marine environment, or that the lessee is not in compliance with this section. The commission shall take immediate remedial action to avoid or eliminate significant damage, or the threat of significant damage, to the marine environment.

(5) Before issuance of the lease, the lessee shall provide baseline benthic habitat and community assessments of the proposed lease site to the applicable regional water quality control board or the State Water Resources Control Board, and shall monitor the benthic habitat and community during the operation of the lease in a manner determined by the regional board or the State Water Resources Control Board. The regional board and the State Water Resources Control Board may establish and impose reasonable permit fees to pay for the costs of administering and conducting the assessment and monitoring program.

(6) Finfish numbers and density shall be limited to what can be safely raised while protecting the marine environment, as specified by the terms of the lease, subject to review and amendment by the commission.

(7) The use of all drugs, chemicals, and antibiotics, and amounts used and applied, shall be minimized. All drugs, therapeutic substances, and antibiotics shall be used and applied only as approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for marine finfish aquaculture. The lessee shall report that use and application to the commission on a regular schedule, as determined by the commission, but no less than annually, that shall be included in the terms of the lease. The commission shall review those reports on a regular basis and at least annually.

(8) The commission shall require all farmed fish to be marked, tagged, or otherwise identified as belonging to the lessee in a manner determined appropriate by the commission, unless the commission determines that identifying farmed fish is unnecessary for protecting wild fish stocks, the marine environment, or other ocean uses.

(9) All facilities and operations shall be designed to prevent the escape of farmed fish into the marine environment and to withstand severe weather conditions and marine accidents. The lessee shall maintain records on all escapes in a manner determined by the commission. In the event of more than de minimis escapement, the number of escaped fish and the circumstances surrounding the incident shall be reported immediately to the commission, and the lessee shall be responsible for damages to the marine environment caused by those escaped fish, as determined by the commission.

(10) The lessee shall, at a minimum, meet all applicable requirements imposed by the State Water Resources Control Board and the regional water quality control boards, and shall prevent discharges to the maximum extent possible.

######### 15506.  
Except for those diseases in the list compiled pursuant to Section 15500, infected plants or animals shall not be quarantined or destroyed, unless the director, in consultation with the Aquaculture Disease Committee, finds that an outbreak of aquatic disease among privately cultured plants or animals presents a threat to the aquaculture industry or to fish life or plant life.



######### 15507.  
If the director, in consultation with the Aquaculture Disease Committee, finds that a disease is present in a nearby government operated facility or in nearby wild stocks, infected plants or animals in a private aquaculture facility shall not be quarantined or destroyed unless similar action is taken with respect to the government facility and wild stocks.



######### 15508.  
Reports of those diseases and parasites compiled pursuant to Section 15500 shall be immediately forwarded by the director to the Aquaculture Disease Committee and shall be promptly investigated by the department.



######### 15509.  
No person may move, or allow to be moved, any of the aquatic plants or animals which are subject to a quarantine established pursuant to Section 15505 across the quarantine line which is established, unless the person has first obtained a permit from the director authorizing the movement.

The director may issue a permit after inspection, if the aquatic plants or animals, premises, transportation vehicles, and equipment which are subject to the quarantine established pursuant to Section 15505 are properly cleaned and disinfected.



######### 15510.  
If the director determines that any disease designated pursuant to Section 15500 exists among domestic aquatic plants and animals, or that aquatic plants and animals have been exposed, or may have been exposed, to the disease, or to the vectors of the disease, in any other state or territory in the United States or in any foreign country, and the importation of aquatic plants or animals from the state, territory, or foreign country may transmit, carry, or disseminate the disease to domestic plants and animals within this state, the director shall notify the commission which may, after consulting the State Department of Health Services and the Department of Food and Agriculture, issue a regulation restricting or prohibiting the importation of the diseased or infected aquatic plants or animals into this state from any other state, territory, or foreign country.

If the replacement value is not settled between the owner and the department, the replacement value shall be determined by an appraiser appointed by the director and an appraiser appointed by the owner. Appraiser’s fees shall be paid by the appointing party. Disputes between these two appraisers shall be submitted to arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.

(b) If the department provides replacement stock to an aquaculturist whose plants or animals are destroyed pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 15505, the amount to be paid to the aquaculturist pursuant to this section shall be reduced by the value of the replacement stock, as determined by the department.

(c) The result of the arbitration or the amount settled between the owner and the department, reduced by the value determined by the department of any replacement stock provided under subdivision (b), may be submitted as a claim by the owner to the Department of General Services pursuant to Section 15513.



######### 15513.  
Claims against the department arising under this chapter may be submitted pursuant to Section 905.2 of the Government Code.



######### 15514.  
No claim arising under this chapter shall be paid where the director, in consultation with the Aquaculture Disease Committee, finds that the claimant’s management practices were negligent or in violation of law, and that the negligence or violation was the proximate cause of the disease or infection prompting the order of destruction or finds the claimant willfully violated any provision of Section 15505.



######### 15516.  
The owner of an aquaculture product who does not diligently pursue the eradication of a disease from its facility when ordered to do so by the director shall be responsible for paying to the director the full costs of the department for all disease eradication efforts conducted by the department to eradicate the disease. Payment of the costs under this section shall not excuse compliance with the provisions of law, regulations of the commission, and orders of the director, nor be a defense in any criminal or civil proceedings.

#### DIVISION 13. STATE-TRIBAL AGREEMENTS GOVERNING INDIAN FISHING [16000 - 16011]  


##### CHAPTER 1. Legislative Findings [16000- 16000.]  

######### 16000.  
The Legislature finds:

(a) Jurisdiction over the protection and development of natural resources, especially the fish resource, is of great importance to both the State of California and California Indian tribes.

(b) To California Indian tribes, control over their minerals, lands, water, wildlife, and other resources is crucial to their economic self-sufficiency and the preservation of their heritage.  On the other hand, the State of California is concerned about protecting and developing its resources; protecting, restoring, and developing its commercial and recreational salmon fisheries; ensuring public access to its waterways; and protecting the environment within its borders.

(c) More than any other issue confronting the State of California and California Indian tribes, the regulation of natural resources, especially fish, transcends political boundaries.

(d) In many cases, the State of California and California Indian tribes have differed in their respective views of the nature and extent of state versus tribal jurisdiction in areas where Indians have historically fished. Despite these frequent and often bitter disputes, both the state and the tribes seek, as their mutual goal, the protection and preservation of the fish resource.  This division is an attempt to provide a legal mechanism, other than protracted and expensive litigation over unresolved legal issues, for achieving that mutual goal.

(e) This division creates a pilot project that will involve and encourage the efforts of the State of California and the Covelo Indian Community of the Round Valley Indian Reservation to reach a mutual agreement regarding the legal framework for the exercise of Indian subsistence fishing in the boundary streams of the historic 1873 Round Valley Indian Reservation.  It is hoped that this pilot project, if successful, will provide the incentive for enactment of broader legislation that would authorize similar negotiated agreements with other California Indian tribes.







##### CHAPTER 2. General Provisions [16001 - 16005]  

######### 16001.  
The definition in this chapter shall govern the construction of this division.



######### 16002.

######### 16005.  
“Historic 1873 Round Valley Indian Reservation” means the reservation described and set aside by Congress for the Covelo Indian Community in the Act of March 3, 1873 (17 Stat. 633).







##### CHAPTER 3. Negotiation and Approval of Agreement [16006 - 16009]  

######### 16006.  
Subject to the approval of the commission, the department may enter into a mutual agreement or compact with the Covelo Indian Community respecting jurisdiction and authority to regulate traditional Indian subsistence fishing practices in the boundary streams of the historic 1873 Round Valley Indian Reservation.



######### 16007.  
Any agreement or compact entered into pursuant to Section 16006 shall be submitted by the department to the commission for review and approval.



######### 16008.  
Any agreement or compact entered into pursuant to Section 16006 shall not be effective until they are approved by the commission. The commission may consider and approve an agreement or compact at any of its regular or special meetings.



######### 16009.  
The commission shall give notice of the time and place of any meeting at which the approval of an agreement or compact entered into under this division will be considered by publishing prior notice in any publication issued by the Resources Agency or the department after determining the time and place of the meeting. The commission shall make copies of the proposed agreement or compact available to the public on request and the notice shall contain a statement to that effect. All meetings required by this section shall be open to the public.







##### CHAPTER 4. Enforceability of an Agreement or Compact [16010 - 16011]  

######### 16010.  
Any agreement or compact entered into pursuant to this division shall be enforceable by the parties only to the extent and in the forum or forums provided for under the terms of the agreement or compact.



######### 16011.  
The department may promulgate regulations consistent with the provisions of any agreement or compact entered into pursuant to Section 16006. The application and enforcement of those regulations shall be in accordance with the express provisions of the agreement or compact.





#### DIVISION 13.5. STATE-TRIBAL AGREEMENTS GOVERNING INDIAN FISHING ON THE KLAMATH RIVER [16500 - 16541]  


##### CHAPTER 1. Legislative Findings [16500- 16500.]  

######### 16500.  
The Legislature finds:

(a) Jurisdiction over the protection and development of natural resources, especially the fish resource, is of great importance to both the State of California and California Indian tribes.

(b) To California Indian tribes, control over their minerals, lands, water, wildlife, and other resources within Indian country is crucial to their economic self-sufficiency and the preservation of their heritage. On the other hand, the State of California is concerned about protecting and developing its resources; protecting, restoring, and developing its commercial and recreational salmon fisheries; ensuring public access to its waterways; and protecting the environment within its borders.

(c) More than any other issue confronting the State of California and California Indian tribes, the regulation of natural resources, especially fish, transcends political boundaries.

(d) In many cases, the State of California and California Indian tribes have differed in their respective views of the nature and extent of state versus tribal jurisdiction in areas where Indians have historically fished. Despite these frequent and often bitter disputes, both the state and the tribes seek, as their mutual goal, the protection and preservation of the fish resource. This division is an attempt to provide a legal mechanism, other than protracted and expensive litigation over unresolved legal issues, for achieving that mutual goal on the Klamath River.

(e) The department has exercised jurisdiction over the Klamath River from the mouth of the river through the Yurok Reservation and the Hoopa Valley Reservation, but the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian tribes thereon have also asserted jurisdiction over that river. The river itself lies within a disputed area and proper management of the resource presents, therefore, unique and difficult problems in the exercise of fishing practices by all user groups.

(f) Although commercial fishing may not be a traditional practice of the tribes existing along the Klamath River within the boundaries of the land of the Yurok Reservation and the Hoopa Valley Reservation, nevertheless, the department has historically supported the concept of tribal fishing, including a tribal commercial fishing industry where the industry is consistent with the need to preserve the species, sound management, and where that usage would not adversely effect other user groups, including sportfishing and the ocean commercial fishery.

(g) A commercial fishery existed on the Klamath River in the late 19th century and early 20th century, in which the Indian tribes existing along the river participated, but commercial fishing was abolished in 1933 with the passage of the predecessor to Section 8434, and, further, that salmon resources have declined historically due to past water developmental policies and timber harvesting practices. With a reduced number of fish available, special laws are needed to protect those resources and allocate them fairly among the various user groups.

(h) This division is not only enacted to provide the legal mechanism described above, but is also intended to encourage cooperative agreements to allow protection of the resource among all of the user groups. In so doing, the Legislature recognizes the unique status of the Klamath River and the fishing therein.







##### CHAPTER 2. General Provisions and Definitions [16510 - 16520]  

######### 16510.  
The definition in this chapter shall govern the construction of this division.



######### 16511.
