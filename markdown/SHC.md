######### 73.  
The commission shall relinquish to any county or city any portion of any state highway within the county or city that has been deleted from the state highway system by legislative enactment, and  the relinquishment shall become effective upon the first day of the next calendar or fiscal year, whichever first occurs after the effective date of the legislative enactment. It may likewise relinquish any portion of any state highway that has been superseded by relocation.  Whenever the department and the county or city concerned have entered into an agreement providing therefor, or the legislative body of the county or city has adopted a resolution consenting thereto, the commission may relinquish, to that county or city, any frontage or service road or outer highway, within the territorial limits of the county or city, which has a right-of-way of at least 40 feet in width and which has been constructed as a part of a state highway project, but does not constitute a part of the main traveled roadway thereof.  The commission may also relinquish, to a county or city within whose territorial limits it is located, any nonmotorized transportation facility, as defined in Section  887, constructed as part of a state highway project if the county or city, as the case may be, has entered into an agreement providing therefor or its legislative body has adopted a resolution consenting thereto.

Relinquishment shall be by resolution.  A certified copy of  the resolution shall be filed with the board of supervisors or the city clerk, as the case may be.  A certified copy of the resolution shall also be recorded in the office of the recorder of the county where the land is located and, upon its recordation, all right, title, and interest of the state in and to that portion of any state highway shall vest in the county or city, as the case may be, and that highway or portion thereof shall thereupon constitute a county road or city street, as the case may be.

The vesting of all right, title, and interest of the state in and to portions of any state highways heretofore relinquished by the commission, in the county or city to which it was relinquished, is hereby confirmed.

Prior to relinquishing any portion of a state highway to a county or a city, except where required by legislative enactment, the department shall give 90 days’ notice in writing of intention to relinquish to the board of supervisors, or the city council, as the case may be.  Where the resolution of relinquishment contains a recital as to the giving of the notice, adoption of the resolution of relinquishment shall be conclusive evidence that the notice has been given.

The commission shall not relinquish to any county or city any portion of any state highway that has been superseded by relocation until the department has placed the highway, as defined in Section 23, in a state of good repair.  This requirement shall not obligate the department for widening, new construction, or major reconstruction, except as the commission may direct.  A state of good repair requires maintenance, as defined in Section 27, including litter removal, weed control, and tree and shrub trimming to the time of relinquishment.

Within the 90-day period, the board of supervisors or the city council may protest in writing to the commission stating the reasons therefor, including, but not limited to, objections that the highway is not in a state of good repair, or is not needed for public use and should be vacated by the commission.  In the event that the commission does not comply with the requests of the protesting body, it may proceed with the relinquishment only after a public hearing given to the protesting body on 10 days’ written notice.

No city street, county road, or other public highway of any kind shall be opened into or connected with any freeway unless and until the commission adopts a resolution consenting thereto and fixing the terms and conditions on which such connection shall be made and the commission may give or withhold its consent or fix such terms and conditions as, in its opinion, will best subserve the public interest.



######### 100.21.  
(a) Whenever a street or highway closing agreement is required by Section 100.2, the department shall not acquire, except by gift, and except in hardship or protective cases as determined by the department or the commission, any real property for a freeway through a city until an agreement is first executed with the city council, or for a freeway through unincorporated territory in a county until an agreement is first executed with the board of supervisors.

(b) A public works plan approved for the north coast corridor project within the coastal zone shall include all of the elements of the north coast corridor project to be carried out by the department or the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), including coastal access, highway, transit, multimodal, community enhancement, and environmental restoration, and mitigation projects. Once the public works plan for the north coast corridor has been approved and certified by the California Coastal Commission, subsequent review by the California Coastal Commission of a notice of intent to develop for a specific project in the public works plan shall be limited to imposing conditions to ensure consistency of the project with the public works plan. The public works plan shall satisfy all of the following:

(1) Identify the California Coastal Commission’s area of original jurisdiction and provide a process for obtaining coastal development permits from the California Coastal Commission directly in those areas.

(2) Contain, but not be limited to, the following elements: the type, size, intensity, and location of all development included in the north coast corridor project; the maximum and minimum size of facilities proposed to be constructed; the standards to which the projects should conform; the thresholds for when amendments to the public works plan may be required; and a proposed timetable and phasing program for all projects.

(3) Establish the mitigation measures that the department and SANDAG will be required to undertake prior to construction of each phase. The mitigation measures shall be described with sufficient detail to allow the department and SANDAG to accurately estimate the cost and effort associated with each particular measure and avoid the need for an amendment to the public works plan unless a project is inconsistent with the project description in the approved public works plan.

(4) Establish the process by which project design and mitigation measures included in the public works plan, and the California Coastal Commission’s findings regarding those measures, may be applied to subsequent coastal development permit approvals and other approvals or determinations for subsequent phases of the project.

(c) For all elements of the north coast corridor project that are located, entirely or in part, in the coastal zone, as defined by Sections 30103 and 66610 of the Public Resources Code, the department and SANDAG shall comply with all of the following requirements:

(1) Collaborate with all stakeholders, including local agencies through which the proposed project traverses, the California Coastal Commission, and other affected local, state, and federal agencies to ensure that multimodal transportation options are evaluated and included in the public works plan and, where appropriate, in the project design.

(2) SANDAG shall establish a safe routes to transit program that integrates the adopted regional bike plan with transit services.

(3) SANDAG shall recommend that the department select an alternative no larger than the 8+4 Buffer Alternative as the preferred alternative for the State Highway Route 5 north coast corridor after it makes a finding that it is consistent with TransNet as approved by voters in 2004. The determination of the preferred alternative shall be made by the department and the Federal Highway Administration in their environmental impact report or environmental impact statement, and SANDAG shall include the preferred alternative in its next update to the regional transportation plan.

(4) In order to reduce environmental impacts to the coastal lagoons, both rail and highway bridges crossing each lagoon shall be planned and constructed concurrently, unless construction in phases will result in an environmentally superior alternative to concurrent construction. SANDAG and the department shall ensure that bridges are constructed to their ultimate width and length so that construction impacts to each lagoon are minimized.

(5) The public works plan shall evaluate the traffic impacts of the proposed capacity-increasing highway project on city and county streets and roads within the coastal zone, and the department shall consult with the affected local jurisdictions regarding those impacts and include the results of the consultations within the public works plan.

(6) Environmental consequences of the proposed north coast corridor project shall be monitored to ensure that the benefits from mitigation, as described in the permits issued for the individual projects, are being achieved.

(7) Construction of all or a portion of the capacity-increasing project on State Highway Route 5 shall move forward concurrently with multimodal projects and environmental mitigation and enhancement projects within each phase, as specified in the public works plan. The phasing plan shall include criteria specified by the California Coastal Commission within the public works plan that shall be met before the next phase of development can occur, and each phase shall include a balance of transit and highway improvements. Although the department and SANDAG shall endeavor to maintain a balance of transit, rail, highway, and environmental improvements in each phase, nothing in this section is intended to limit the ability of the department or SANDAG to seek a public works plan amendment from the California Coastal Commission in order to accelerate a project from a later phase in the public works plan if additional funding is identified to carry out the project at an earlier stage than originally intended.

(8) Prior to a public works plan being submitted to the California Coastal Commission by the department and SANDAG, the department and SANDAG shall provide at least two public hearings on the public works plan for the north coast corridor project.

(9) SANDAG has agreed that it will be responsible for constructing improvements in the Los Angeles-San Diego-San Luis Obispo rail corridor and funding portions of the improvements to that corridor and State Highway Route 5 within the north coast corridor using funding from a San Diego County voter-approved transaction and use tax ordinance known as TransNet. Pursuant to that agreement, SANDAG shall commit to dedicate a portion of the TransNet Regional Habitat Conservation Fund for regional habitat acquisition, management, and monitoring activities necessary to implement habitat conservation plans based on the estimated economic benefits derived from permitting and approval efficiencies on the north coast corridor project as a result of the procedures of this section, with that funding to be released by SANDAG in phases based upon the proportion of project work that has been issued permits, consistency reviews, or other applicable approvals, and in accordance with any other criteria as deemed appropriate by SANDAG taking into account the purpose and intent of TransNet.

(d) The California Coastal Commission, the department, and SANDAG shall work cooperatively toward completing all design approvals, reviews, determinations, and permitting for the north coast corridor project on an expedited basis. To meet the goals in this section, the following provisions shall apply:

(1) The Legislature finds that it is the California Coastal Commission’s role to apply a regional or statewide perspective to land use debates where the use in question is of greater than local significance. To that end, the California Coastal Commission is authorized to utilize Section 30515 of the Public Resources Code for the north coast corridor project and the process referenced in that section may be streamlined pursuant to agreement between the California Coastal Commission and those jurisdictions with an approved local coastal program.

(2) The department and SANDAG shall perform work and complete development consistent with the phasing program adopted in the public works plan pursuant to subdivision (b) unless changes are reviewed and approved by the California Coastal Commission.

(3) A public works plan prepared for the north coast corridor project by the department and SANDAG shall be treated as a long-range development plan to which the provisions in Sections 21080.5 and 21080.9 of the Public Resources Code shall apply.

(4) A permitting agency’s decision to review and approve a public works plan, a plan amendment, or related notice of impending development, make a consistency determination, or issue a permit for the north coast corridor project shall be reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.

(5) The Legislature finds that the California Coastal Commission, the department, and SANDAG have agreed that, following approval of the public works plan, the California Coastal Commission shall limit its subsequent regulatory review of the rail aspects of the north coast corridor project to federal consistency.

(e) A notice of determination issued pursuant to Section 21108 or 21152 of the Public Resources Code after January 1, 2011, but prior to January 1, 2012, for a project subject to this section shall be suspended by the department until it is determined that the project’s environmental documents are consistent with the provisions of this section.

(f) (1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede, or in any way alter or lessen the effect or application of, the California Coastal Act of 1976 (Division 20 (commencing with Section 30000) of the Public Resources Code).

(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to narrow the authority of the California Coastal Commission, at any stage of the approval or review process, to resolve policy conflicts pursuant to Section 30200 of the Public Resources Code.

(3) Nothing in this section is intended to apply to any program, project, or other activity that is not related to the north coast corridor project.

(c) To acquire an existing bridge, or a right of way over the location of such bridge, whenever the acquisition of such bridge or right of way by the State alone would ordinarily require an excessive expenditure of State highway money.



######### 107.  
Any such agreement may be:

(a) With any person for the construction of a new bridge and the use of any such bridge thereafter jointly by such person and the public.

(b) With the owner of any existing bridge for the reconstruction thereof, or for the replacement thereof by a new bridge, and the use of any such bridge thereafter jointly by such owner and the public.



######### 108.  
Any agreement made under the authority of sections 106 and 107 may provide:

(a) Either for apportionment of the expense of any such construction, reconstruction, replacement, improvement, or maintenance between such owner or person and the State, or for the surrender to the State of the rights and property of the owner and the construction, reconstruction, replacement, improvement, or maintenance of any such bridge partly or wholly at the expense of the State.

(b) For the terms and conditions upon which the owner may use such bridge jointly with the public after the construction, reconstruction, replacement or improvement thereof.

(c) For other pertinent matters to give effect to sections 106 and 107.



######### 109.  
Any such bridge acquired, constructed, reconstructed, replaced or improved in the manner provided in sections 106, 107 and 108 is a part of the State highway system and title thereto shall vest in the State. Any funds which, without such cooperative agreement, would be available for the construction, reconstruction, replacement, improvement or maintenance of a bridge at such location on the State highway system, shall be available for a similar use under such cooperative agreement.



######### 109.5.  
Whenever the construction of any facility of the United States or any department or agency thereof, or any feature thereof, requires construction or relocation of, or other change in any state highway or bridge, the department may enter into an agreement with the United States, or with the United States and any person, providing therefor, and for the exchange of any property required thereby. The department may enter into like agreements for acquisition of a right-of-way over, or respecting maintenance of, any facility, constructed or owned by the United States or any department or agency thereof, all or any portion of which is to be used for highway purposes.



######### 110.  
Nothing in this article shall prohibit any county or city from contributing to the State, in the manner provided by law, funds or real property or interests therein for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, replacement, improvement or maintenance of any such bridge as is provided for by sections 106, 107 and 108, nor prohibit the relinquishment of any such bridge by the department to any county or city. Upon relinquishment such bridge shall be under the supervision and control of the county or city to which it is relinquished.



######### 111.  
Whenever the natural course of a State highway passes into or through any city and a State highway route through or around such city is not specifically described by law, the commission shall determine the location of the connecting portion necessary to make the State highway continuous. Such location may be either through or around such city, depending upon the commission’s determination as to which location will be of the greatest benefit to through traffic upon such State highway.

Any portion of any street or highway, within the limits of such city, may be adopted by the commission as a part of the State highway system without compensation to the city.



######### 111.5.  
Whenever a city street or a county highway and an existing state highway (1) are substantially parallel; (2) each has been or is to be restricted to one-way traffic, proceeding in opposite directions as to each other, by ordinance of such city or county duly enacted and applicable thereto; and (3) the commission determines that the existing state highway is inadequate and that state highway traffic conditions can be improved and state highway traffic more economically served than by confining improvements to the existing state highway, the commission may adopt any portion of the city street or county highway so substantially parallel with an existing state highway, as a part of the State Highway System without compensation to the city or county, and the department may improve the same and make necessary connections to route traffic one way on such city street or county highway and the existing state highway, respectively.

Whenever an ordinance of any city or county designating a particular highway as a one-way highway becomes applicable to a state highway, whether an existing state highway at the time of the enactment of such ordinance or a city street or county highway thereafter adopted as a state highway, such ordinance shall not be thereafter rescinded, repealed, revoked or amended by action of the legislative authority of such city or county without the consent in writing of the department with the approval of the commission first obtained, unless otherwise provided by the terms of any written agreement between the State and any city entered into prior to the effective date of this section. If any city street or county highway which has become a portion of the State Highway System pursuant to this section ceases to be a one-way street because the ordinance declaring such street or highway to be a one-way street or highway is rescinded, repealed, revoked, or amended, with the consent of the department, as hereinabove provided, such city street or county highway, or the portion thereof that is no longer restricted to one-way traffic, shall by operation of law revert to the status of a city street or county highway and cease to be a portion of the State Highway System.



######### 112.  
The department may enter into an agreement with any city relative to proceedings to be taken by the city to fix or change the grade of any State highway, or portion thereof, within the city in order to establish a grade specified in such agreement. The city, in fixing such grade, may follow the procedure specified in any statute or ordinance providing for fixing or changing the grades of city streets with like effect as if such highway were a city street and the grade so established or changed shall be the official grade of such State highway or portion thereof.

The city may contribute any part of the expense of such proceedings, including payment of claims, out of any funds available to it for the acquisition of rights of way for the construction, improvement or maintenance of streets.

This section does not limit the right of the department, on authorization of the commission, to proceed as provided in Article 1 of Chapter 6 of this division.



######### 113.  
Upon a request from the department the governing body of any city may acquire any real property or interest therein needed for state highway purposes and lying within such city. The title to such real property or interest therein may be taken in the name of the State or of the city.

Any city may aid in the construction, improvement or maintenance of any state highway located in whole or in part within its boundaries by contributing any part of the expense thereof to the department out of any city funds available or to become available for construction, improvement or maintenance of streets within the city.

(b) The department shall enter into a cooperative agreement with a city, county, or other public entity to perform professional and technical project development services, if the department determines that the city, county, or other public entity in which the project is located has qualified and available staff to perform the necessary project services.

######### 117.  
Unless otherwise specifically provided in the instrument conveying title, the acquisition, ownership, or control by the department of any right-of-way over any real property for state highway purposes includes the right of the department to issue, under Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 660), permits for the location in the right-of-way of any structures or fixtures necessary to telegraph, telephone, advanced communication or information services, or electrical lines or of any ditches, pipes, drains, sewers, or underground structures.

(a) If the department determines that real property or an interest therein, previously or hereafter acquired by the state for highway purposes, is no longer necessary for those purposes, the department may sell, contract to sell, sell by trust deed, or exchange the real property or interest therein in the manner and upon terms, standards, and conditions established by the commission. The payment period in a contract of sale or sale by trust deed shall not extend longer than 10 years from the time the contract of sale or trust deed is executed, and a transaction involving a contract of sale or sale by trust deed to private parties shall require a downpayment of at least 30 percent of the purchase price, except as follows:

All contracts of sale or sales by trust deed, for the purpose of housing for persons and families of low or moderate income shall bear interest. The rate of interest for the contract or sale shall be computed annually, and shall be the same as the average rate returned by the Pooled Money Investment Board for the past five fiscal years immediately preceding the year in which the payment is made. The contract of sale and sales by trust deeds shall not be utilized if the proposed development or sale qualifies for financing from other sources and if the financing makes feasible the provision of low- and moderate-income housing.

(2) Improved residential property sold to a local public agency pursuant to paragraph (1), if subsequently sold or transferred to a nonprofit housing organization, shall have the endorsement of the city in which the parcels are located, or the county if the parcels are located in an unincorporated area, that the housing shall remain at affordable housing costs to persons and families of low or moderate income and very low income households for the longest feasible time, but for not less than 15 years, as determined by the city or county, as applicable. By endorsing the sale, the city or county accepts the responsibility of ensuring the housing remains affordable. The local public agency shall record in the office of the county recorder covenants or restrictions implementing this subdivision. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the covenants or restrictions shall run with the land and shall be enforceable against the original purchaser from the department and successors in interest.

######### 118.1.  
Except as provided in Article 8 (commencing with Section 54220) of Chapter 5 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code and Section 118. 6 of this code, with respect to commercial real property acquired for the construction of a state highway, but no longer required for that purpose because the construction will not be undertaken, the department shall first offer the real property for sale at its current fair market value to the occupant thereof if the occupant is renting or leasing the real property from the department, has used and occupied the real property, and has made improvements of a value in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000) on the real property during that time at his or her own expense consistent with the terms of the rental or lease agreement with the department. For the purpose of establishing fair market value, the department shall obtain at least two independent appraisals from qualified appraisers.

The failure of the department to first offer excess real property as required by this section shall not affect the validity of any conveyance of this excess real property to any person or entity unaware of the failure of the department to do so. However, this shall in no way be construed as releasing the department from its responsibility in offering that property to the occupants thereof first.



######### 118.5.  
No parcel of property acquired by eminent domain for the purposes specified in Section 104 which, in its entirety, is found to be no longer necessary for such purposes shall be subject to public sale, unless an amount equal to the taxes which would have been paid by the owner had the property not been acquired by the state is transmitted by the department to the county auditor of the county in which the property is located. The amount of any payments made pursuant to Section 104.10 with respect to the property shall be deducted from the amount required to be transmitted pursuant to this section.

The money received by the county under this section shall be expended only for the purposes authorized by Article XIX of the California Constitution.



######### 118.6.  
The department shall, to the greatest extent possible, offer to sell or exchange excess real property within one year from the date that it is determined by the department to be excess.

Excess real property which consists of lands of notable environmental value, such as, but not limited to, lands of extraordinary scenic beauty, lands fronting on waterway, lakes, and marshes, lands within the boundaries of parks, recreational areas, wildlife preserves or refuges, and lands providing wildlife habitat shall first be offered for sale or exchange to public agencies operating parks and recreational areas as follows:

(a) To any park or recreation department of any city within which the land may be situated.

(b) To any park or recreation department of the county within which the land is situated.

(c) To any regional park authority having jurisdiction within the area in which the land is situated.

The public agency desiring to purchase such land for park or recreation use shall notify the department within 60 days of its intent to purchase the land after receipt of the department’s notification of intent to sell the land. If the public agency desiring to purchase the land and the department are unable to arrive at a mutually satisfactory sales price for the land during the 60-day period, the land may be disposed of in the normal manner.

The failure of the department to first offer excess real property which consists of lands of notable environmental value to public agencies operating parks and recreational areas shall not affect the validity of any conveyance of such excess real property to any person or entity unaware of the failure of the department to do so; however, this shall in no way be construed as releasing the department from its responsibility in offering such property to such public agencies first.



######### 118.7.  
(a) The department may, upon terms, standards, and conditions approved by the commission and the California Coastal Commission, transfer environmental mitigation property located within the city limits of Huntington Beach to a public agency or to a nonprofit corporation that is qualified pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and is organized for, among other things, open-space or land conservation purposes.

(b) For the purposes of this section, “environmental mitigation property,” means property owned by the department that is required by state or federal law, or by permit conditions imposed by a state or federal agency, to be preserved or restored as natural habitat to offset the environmental impacts caused by the construction and operation of a state highway improvement project.

Environmental mitigation property shall be maintained as natural habitat in accordance with the permit conditions. “Environmental mitigation property” means property situated immediately east and adjacent to State Highway Route 1 located between Brookhurst Street and Newland Street with an approximate size of 7.1 acres.

(c) As a condition to the transfer of environmental mitigation property pursuant to subdivision (a), the department may enter into a cooperative agreement with the transferee to provide funding for the future maintenance of the property consistent with any permit conditions and mitigation requirements imposed by state or federal law or conditions imposed by a state or federal agency. In determining the amount of the funding provided, the department shall consider the costs of maintaining the property and shall offset from the amount of those costs any benefit or value received by the transferee as a result of the transfer.

The department shall provide the fiscal and transportation policy committees of the Legislature with at least 30 days prior written notice of the transfer and cooperative agreement, and the amount of any funding in accordance with the transfer and cooperative agreement, to facilitate the Legislature’s review of the transfer.

Funding provided as part of a transfer agreement shall be limited to a single occurrence.

(d) (1) The public agency or nonprofit corporation to which the department transfers the environmental mitigation property shall assume the long-term responsibility for the future maintenance of the property. 

(2) (A) If the public agency or nonprofit corporation fails to maintain the property in the manner required by law and in the manner described in subdivision (b), or if the nonprofit corporation ceases to exist, the property shall automatically revert to the department.

(B) If the property reverts back to the department pursuant to this paragraph, any remaining funds from the original transfer pursuant to subdivision (a) shall revert back to the department.

This section shall not impose any liability upon the State where it would not otherwise exist.



######### 135.  
The department may enter into contracts for the removal or relocation of structures or improvements situated upon real property over which a right-of-way for state highway purposes has been or is to be acquired. Nothing in this section limits or restricts the authority of the department to make agreements authorized by Section 1263.610 of the Code of Civil Procedure.



######### 135.3.  
The Legislature intends by this act to provide prompt and equitable relocation assistance to low-income individuals and families displaced because of the construction of state highway projects in areas where the market value of real property is economically depressed. The Legislature by establishing a replacement housing program for such individuals and families intends to accomplish this objective of providing housing which is decent, safe, sanitary, and functionally equivalent to the housing eliminated by highway construction. Such replacement housing program shall be coordinated with the relocation advisory assistance provided by the department in accordance with Section 156.5. The Legislature further intends that to the extent the department deems feasible such housing shall be supplied by existing housing, moved housing, and refurbished housing before new replacement housing is constructed on a volume basis.

The Legislature finds that the foregoing objectives can best be achieved by enabling low-income persons in economically depressed areas affected by state highway construction to participate in the development and execution of the replacement housing program. Accordingly, when the initial replacement housing program is undertaken for the assistance of persons displaced by the construction of State Highway Route 105 in Los Angeles County, such program shall be conducted in a manner conducive to maximum community participation, thereby assisting in alleviation of excessive unemployment by utilizing local labor and contributing to the development of training programs for unskilled labor.

The Legislature further finds that conventional contracting procedures, including competitive bidding, may not be consistent with the attainment of these objectives. Therefore, in carrying out this initial replacement housing program on State Highway Route 105, the department may enter into the contracts contemplated by Section 135.7 pursuant to such procedures as the director determines to be best suited to the achievement of the maximum community participation consistent with the economical completion of the freeway projects.

The Legislature further finds and declares that the exemption from competitive bidding authorized by this section is made by reason of the unique nature of the initial replacement housing program on State Highway Route 105, and is not to be considered as establishing a precedent for exempting any other public works construction from competitive bidding and other conventional contracting procedures, nor as in derogation of the fundamental policy of the Legislature that contractors for public works be selected by competitive bidding in order to secure economy of construction and other benefits which accrue to the public by reason of such contracting procedures.

(k) Before determining the amount for local subvention required by this section, the department shall first deduct the amount authorized by the Legislature for increased department oversight of the federal subvented program.



######### 182.8.  
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature that this program help increase flexibility in the use of state and federal funding to complete transportation improvements. The ability to exchange certain federal funds for state funds may enhance that flexibility. However, it is the intent of the Legislature that the commission make these exchanges only if the exchanges do not compromise other state funded projects or activities.

(b) The commission shall propose guidelines and procedures to implement this section, hold a public hearing on the guidelines, and adopt the guidelines on or before February 1, 2001. The commission shall begin the exchange program on or before February 1, 2001, if it determines that funding is available for that purpose. The commission may amend its guidelines after holding a public hearing, but may not amend the guidelines between the time it notifies regional transportation planning agencies of the amount of state funds available for exchange and its approval of projects for exchange in any given year.

(c) On or before January 5 of each year, the department shall report to the commission the amounts apportioned as federal local assistance in the regional surface transportation and congestion mitigation and air quality programs for the year, the Federal Obligation Authority for the year, and the amount of federal funds it expects to be able to obligate for work on projects in all programs on or before September 30 of that year, and the commission, in cooperation with the department, shall determine the amount of state funds from the Traffic Congestion Relief Fund that can be made available for exchange under this section. If the release of federal apportionments and obligational authority is delayed beyond November 1 in any year, all the dates specified in this section shall be extended by an equivalent time, however, all federal funds exchanged shall be obligated on or before September 30 of the current federal fiscal year.

(d) The commission may exchange funds under this section if it determines all of the following:

(1) Adequate state funds are available to accomplish the exchange without putting at risk other transportation activities or projects needing state funds.

(2) Any exchange will be consistent with full implementation of the Traffic Congestion Relief Act of 2000.

(3) Federal funds received in exchange can be readily and effectively used on other projects or activities by the state during the federal fiscal year.

(e) After making the determinations set forth in subdivision (d) the commission may offer to exchange state funds from the Traffic Congestion Relief Fund for federal local assistance funds, subject to the limits imposed under this section. For the purpose of this section, “federal local assistance” funds means regional surface transportation program or congestion mitigation and air quality program apportionments received that federal fiscal year and apportioned as local assistance pursuant to Sections 182.6 and 182.7.

(f) Not later than February 1 of each year, the commission shall notify the regional transportation planning agencies of the amount of state funds available for exchange for federal local assistance funds for that year. The maximum amount of state funds to be exchanged may not exceed 50 percent of the total amount of federal regional surface transportation program and congestion mitigation and air quality program funds apportioned for the current fiscal year as local assistance pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 182.6 and subdivision (b) of Section 182.7, exclusive of state funds that may be exchanged pursuant to subdivision (g) of Section 182.6, paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (h) of Section 182.6, or Section 182.7. Federal funds exchanged under this program shall be available for projects identified by the commission as ready to obligate during determination of the amount available for exchange. The amount of exchange may not exceed the department’s ability to obligate all federal funds during the current federal fiscal year. The commission may not exchange state funds for regional surface transportation program funds required to be spent for transportation enhancements. This section does not affect the amount of exchange under subdivision (g) of Sections 182.6, or paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (h) of Section 182.6.

(g) Regional transportation planning agencies may submit applications for exchange of funds to the commission not later than March 15 of each year. Applications shall identify the proposed use for the exchange funds, including project descriptions, cost estimates, scopes of work, schedules for construction, schedules for expenditures, and any other information required by the commission. The commission may require a region to identify priorities among applications it submits.

(h) If the commission receives applications for more exchange funds than the amount of state funds available, the commission shall select projects for exchange up to the amount of state funds available. The commission shall explain the criteria it uses to select projects, which shall include, but are not limited to, all of the following:

(1) Removal of all federal funds from projects.

(2) Assessment of projects that would benefit most from removal of federal funding because of size, type, location, agency capability, features, or federal requirements.

(3) Approximate relative equity within the program among regions in receiving state exchange funds over a multiyear period.

(i) The commission may exchange state funds for federal local assistance funds with agencies requesting exchanges. Agencies wishing to exchange their federal funds shall provide apportionments and obligation authority at the same rate the Federal Highway Administration distributes obligation authority. Agencies exchanging federal funds shall receive funds equal to 90 percent of the obligation authority exchanged. The commission shall approve exchanges of funds not later than its second regularly scheduled meeting following March 15 each year.

(j) The commission shall determine an exchange payment schedule based on expenditure plans. The commission may suspend exchange payment schedules if it determines projects are not proceeding.

(k) For financial display and reporting purposes, obligational authority received pursuant to this section shall be reported as a revenue accrual in the Traffic Congestion Relief Fund in the year in which the exchange is approved under subdivision (i). Funds approved for exchange shall be accrued as expenditures in the year in which the exchange is approved. Notwithstanding Section 16362 of the Government Code, the department shall repay from the State Highway Account to the Traffic Congestion Relief Fund all funds received as federal reimbursements for funds exchanged under this section as they are received from the Federal Highway Administration, except that those repayments are not required to be made more frequently than on a quarterly basis.

(l) State funds provided through an exchange under this section shall be encumbered within one year and expended within three years.

(m) Upon adoption of its implementing guidelines, the commission may consider requests for exchanges under this section.

(n) Regional and local agencies shall use state exchange funds only for projects or purposes for which the federal local assistance funds being exchanged were originally intended, and may not supplant local funds on projects in order that those local funds can subsequently be used for nontransportation purposes. The commission may require agencies to certify that they are meeting this requirement. Agencies not meeting this maintenance of effort requirement may not be allowed to participate in the next exchange cycle.

(o) Not later than the effective date of the reauthorization of the federal surface transportation act, the commission shall submit a report to the Governor and the Legislature recommending any changes in the exchange program necessitated by that reauthorization.

######### 188.5.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(1) The department has determined that in order to provide maximum safety for the traveling public and to ensure continuous and unimpeded operation of the state’s transportation network, six state-owned toll bridges are in need of a seismic safety retrofit, and one state-owned toll bridge is in need of a partial retrofit and a partial replacement.

(2) The bridges identified by the department as needing seismic retrofit are the Benicia-Martinez Bridge, the Carquinez Bridge, the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge, the San Pedro-Terminal Island Bridge (also known as the Vincent Thomas Bridge), the San Diego-Coronado Bridge, and the west span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. The department has also identified the east span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge as needing to be replaced. That replacement span will be safer, stronger, longer lasting, and more cost efficient to maintain than completing a seismic retrofit for the current east span.

(3) The south span of the Carquinez Bridge is to be replaced pursuant to Regional Measure 1, as described in Section 30917.

(4) The cost estimate to retrofit the state-owned toll bridges and to replace the east span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is four billion six hundred thirty-seven million dollars ($4,637,000,000), as follows:

(A) The Benicia-Martinez Bridge retrofit is one hundred ninety million dollars ($190,000,000).

(B) The north span of the Carquinez Bridge retrofit is one hundred twenty-five million dollars ($125,000,000).

(C) The Richmond-San Rafael Bridge retrofit is six hundred sixty-five million dollars ($665,000,000).

(D) The San Mateo-Hayward Bridge retrofit is one hundred ninety million dollars ($190,000,000).

(E) The San Pedro-Terminal Island Bridge retrofit is sixty-two million dollars ($62,000,000).

(F) The San Diego-Coronado Bridge retrofit is one hundred five million dollars ($105,000,000).

(G) The west span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge retrofit, as a lifeline bridge, is seven hundred million dollars ($700,000,000).

(H) Replacement of the east span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is two billion six hundred million dollars ($2,600,000,000).

(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that the following amounts from the following funds shall be allocated until expended, for the seismic retrofit or replacement of state-owned toll bridges:

(1) Six hundred fifty million dollars ($650,000,000) from the 1996 Seismic Retrofit Account in the Seismic Retrofit Bond Fund of 1996 for the seven state-owned toll bridges identified by the department as requiring seismic safety retrofit or replacement.

(2) One hundred forty million dollars ($140,000,000) in surplus revenues generated under the Seismic Retrofit Bond Act of 1996 that are in excess of the amount actually necessary to complete Phase Two of the state’s seismic retrofit program. These excess funds shall be reallocated to assist in financing seismic retrofit of the state-owned toll bridges.

(3) Fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000) from the Vincent Thomas Toll Bridge Revenue Account.

(4) The funds necessary to meet both of the following:

(A) A principal obligation of two billion two hundred eighty-two million dollars ($2,282,000,000) from the seismic retrofit surcharge, including any interest therefrom, imposed pursuant to Section 31010, subject to the limitation set forth in subdivision (c) and subdivision (b) of Section 31010.

(B) All costs of financing, including capitalized interest, reserves, costs of issuance, costs of credit enhancements and any other financial products necessary or desirable in connection therewith, and any other costs related to financing.

(5) Thirty-three million dollars ($33,000,000) from the San Diego-Coronado Toll Bridge Revenue Fund.

(6) Not less than seven hundred forty-five million dollars ($745,000,000) from the State Highway Account to be used toward the eight hundred seventy-five million dollars ($875,000,000) state contribution, to be achieved as follows:

(A) (i) Two hundred million dollars ($200,000,000) to be appropriated for the state-local transportation partnership program described in paragraph (7) of subdivision (d) of Section 164, prior to its repeal by Chapter 622 of the Statutes of 1997, for the 1998–99 fiscal year.

(ii) The remaining funds intended for that program and any program savings to be made available for toll bridge seismic retrofit.

(B) A reduction of not more than seventy-five million dollars ($75,000,000) in the funding level specified in paragraph (4) of subdivision (d) of Section 164, prior to its repeal by Chapter 622 of the Statutes of 1997, for traffic system management.

(C) Three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000) in accumulated savings by the department achieved from better efficiency and lower costs.

(7) Not more than one hundred thirty million dollars ($130,000,000) from the Transit Capital Improvement Program funded by the Public Transportation Account in the State Transportation Fund to be used toward the eight hundred seventy-five million dollars ($875,000,000) state contribution. If the contribution in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (6) exceeds three hundred seventy million dollars ($370,000,000), it is the intent that the amount from the Transit Capital Improvement Program shall be reduced by an amount that is equal to that excess.

(8) (A) The funds necessary to meet principal obligations of not less than six hundred forty-two million dollars ($642,000,000) from the state’s share of the federal Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation (HBRR) Program.

The amount shall be computed as follows:

(1) The commission shall compute, for the county share periods all of the money to be expended for regional improvement projects in County Groups Nos. 1 and 2, respectively, as provided in Section 188.

(2) From the amount computed for County Group No. 1 in paragraph (1) for the county share periods the commission shall determine the amount of programming for each county in the group based on a formula that is based 75 percent on the population of the county to the total population of County Group No. 1 and 25 percent on state highway miles in the county to the total state highway miles in County Group No. 1.

(3) From the amount computed for County Group No. 2 in paragraph (1) for the county share periods the commission shall determine the amount of programming for each county in the group based on a formula that is based 75 percent on the population of the county to the total population of County Group No. 2 and 25 percent on state highway miles in the county to the total state highway miles in County Group No. 2.

(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), that portion of the county population and state highway mileage in El Dorado and Placer Counties that is included within the jurisdiction of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency shall be counted separately toward the area under the jurisdiction of the Tahoe Regional Transportation Agency and may not be included in El Dorado and Placer Counties. The commission shall approve programs, program amendments, and fund reservations for the area under the jurisdiction of the Tahoe Regional Transportation Agency that shall be calculated using the formula described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a).

(c) A transportation planning agency designated pursuant to Section 29532 of the Government Code, or a county transportation commission created by Division 12 (commencing with Section 130000) of the Public Utilities Code, may adopt a resolution to pool its county share programming with any county or counties adopting similar resolutions to consolidate its county shares for two consecutive county share periods into a single share covering both periods. A multicounty transportation planning agency with a population of less than three million may also adopt a resolution to pool the share of any county or counties within its region. The resolution shall provide for pooling the county share programming in any of the pooling counties for the new single share period and shall be submitted to the commission not later than May 1 immediately preceding the commencement of the county share period.

(d) For the purposes of this section, funds programmed shall include the following costs pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 14529 of the Government Code:

(1) The amounts programmed or budgeted for both components of project development in the original programmed year.

(2) Differences that are within 20 percent of the amount reported at the time of allocation pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) for actual right-of-way costs calculated at the time of acceptance of a project construction contract.

(3) Construction contract award amounts, except when those amounts are less than 80 percent of the engineer’s final estimate, excluding construction support, and the commission has adjusted the project construction allocation.

(4) Changes in construction expenditures, except for supplemental project allocations made by the commission, including supplemental allocations made pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 188.9.

(f) For the purposes of this section, the population in each county is that determined by the last preceding federal census, or a subsequent census validated by the Demographic Research Unit of the Department of Finance, at the beginning of each county share period.

(g) For the purposes of this section, “state highway miles” means the miles of state highways open to vehicular traffic at the beginning of each county share period.

(h) It is the intent of the Legislature that there is to be flexibility in programming under this section and Section 188 so that, while ensuring that each county will receive an equitable share of state transportation improvement program funding, the types of projects selected and the programs from which they are funded may vary from county to county.

(i) Commencing with the four-year period commencing on July 1, 2004, individual county share shortfalls and surpluses at the end of each four-year period, if any, shall be carried forward and credited or debited to the following four years.

(j) The commission, with the consent of the department, may consider programming projects in the state transportation improvement program in a county with a population of not more than 1,000,000 at a level higher or lower than the county share, when the regional agency either asks to reserve part or all of the county’s share until a future programming year, to build up a larger share for a higher cost project, or asks to advance an amount of the share, in an amount not to exceed 200 percent of the county’s current share, for a larger project, to be deducted from shares for future programming years. After consulting with the department, the commission may adjust the level of programming in the regional program in the affected region against the level of interregional programming in the improvement program to accomplish the reservation or advancement, for the current state transportation improvement program. The commission shall keep track of any resulting shortfalls or surpluses in county shares.

(k) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), in a region defined by Section 66502 of the Government Code, the transportation planning agency may adopt a resolution to pool the county share of any county or counties within the region, if each county receives no less than 85 percent and not more than 115 percent of its county share for a single county share period and 100 percent of its county share over two consecutive county share periods. The resolution shall be submitted to the commission not later than May 1, immediately preceding the commencement of the county share period.

(l) Federal funds used for federal demonstration projects that use federal obligational authority otherwise available for other projects shall be subtracted from the county share of the county where the project is located.

##### ARTICLE 6. Freeway Noise Attenuation [215.5 - 216.5]  

######### 215.5.  
(a) The department shall develop and implement a system of priorities for ranking the need for installation of noise attenuation barriers along freeways in the California freeway and expressway system.  In establishing a priority system, the department shall give the highest consideration to residential areas which were developed prior to the opening of the freeway.  If alterations have been made to the freeway since its original opening which result in a significant and measurable increase in ambient noise levels, the opening date for that segment of the freeway, for the purposes of determining priorities under this section, is the completion date of that alteration project.  Other criteria for determining priorities shall include the existing and future intensity of sound generated by the freeway, the increase in traffic flow since the original construction of the freeway, the cost of building the soundwall in relation to the expected noise reduction, the number of persons living in close proximity to the freeway, and whether a majority of the occupants in close proximity to the freeway resided there prior to the time the freeway routing was adopted by the commission.  The city or county in which the residential area is located shall be responsible for providing documentation to the department on the percentage of original occupants still residing along the freeway.  

The actual cost of construction shall be used in determining the relative priority ranking of projects funded and constructed pursuant to subdivision (d).  

(b) When all freeways have been ranked in priority order, the department shall, consistent with available funding, include in its proposed state transportation improvement program, a program of construction of noise attenuation barriers beginning with the highest priority.  

In preparing the annual priority list, the department shall not add any new project to the list ahead of a project that has been funded by a city or county, or by any other public agency using public funds, and is awaiting state reimbursement pursuant to subdivision (d).  

(c) The commission shall include in the estimate adopted pursuant to Section 14525 of the Government Code an annual and five-year estimate of funds estimated to be available for noise attenuation barriers along freeways.  If any city or county constructs a noise attenuation barrier along a freeway pursuant to subdivision (d), the commission shall allocate funds for the project in the fiscal year the project would have been eligible for funding based on the department’s priority list and the commission’s fund estimate at the time of approval of the project pursuant to subdivision (d).  

(d) If any city, county, or public agency constructs a noise attenuation barrier along a freeway using public funds prior to the time that the barrier reaches a high enough priority for state funding, then, when the funding priority is reached, the department shall reimburse the city, county, or public agency without interest for the cost of construction, but the reimbursement may not exceed the cost of the department to construct the barriers.  Reimbursement shall be made only if the city, county, or public agency constructs the noise attenuation barrier to the standards approved by department, follows bidding and contracting procedures approved by the department, and the project is approved by the commission.



######### 215.6.  
If any city or county contributes at least 33 percent of the estimated cost of any soundwall project included for the first time in the state transportation improvement program in 1992 or in subsequent years, that project shall be given priority over all other soundwall projects to be included for the first time in that state transportation improvement program.

##### ARTICLE 2.5. State Scenic Highways [260 - 284]  

######### 260.  
It is the intent of the Legislature in designating certain portions of the state highway system as state scenic highways to establish the State’s responsibility for the protection and enhancement of California’s natural scenic beauty by identifying those portions of the state highway system which, together with the adjacent scenic corridors, require special scenic conservation treatment. It is further declared to be the intent of the Legislature in designating such scenic highways to assign responsibility for the development of such scenic highways and for the establishment and application of specific planning and design standards and procedures appropriate thereto and to indicate, in broad statement terms, the location and extent of routes and areas requiring continuing and careful co-ordination of planning, design, construction, and regulation of land use and development, by state and local agencies as appropriate, to protect the social and economic values provided by the State’s scenic resources.



######### 261.  
The department shall establish and apply pertinent planning and design standards for development of official scenic highways.

In establishing and applying such standards for, and undertaking the development of, official scenic highways, the department shall take into consideration the concept of the “complete highway,” which is a highway which incorporates not only safety, utility, and economy but also beauty. The department shall also take into consideration in establishing such standards that, in a “complete highway,” pleasing appearance is a consideration in the planning and design process. In the development of official scenic highways, the department shall give special attention both to the impact of the highway on the landscape and to the highway’s visual appearance. The standards for official scenic highways shall also require that local governmental agencies have taken such action as may be necessary to protect the scenic appearance of the scenic corridor, the band of land generally adjacent to the highway right-of-way, including, but not limited to, (1) regulation of land use and intensity (density) of development; (2) detailed land and site planning; (3) control of outdoor advertising; (4) careful attention to and control of earthmoving and landscaping; and (5) the design and appearance of structures and equipment.



######### 262.  
Whenever the department determines that the corridor protection program for any state highway in the state scenic highway system established by this article has been implemented by local governmental agencies and a plan and program has been developed by the department for bringing the highway up to the standards for official scenic highways established by the department, including the concept of the “complete highway,” as described in Section 261, the department shall designate the highway as an official state scenic highway and shall so indicate the highway in any publications of the department or in any maps which are issued by the department to the public.

The department shall cause appropriate signs to be placed and maintained along the portions of the state scenic highway system which the department has designated as official state scenic highways that indicate that the highways are official state scenic highways.

If at any time the department determines that the corridor protection program of local governmental agencies, with respect to any highway which has been designated as an official state scenic highway, no longer adequately carries out responsibility of the local governmental agencies for the protection of the scenic corridor, it may revoke the designation of the highway as an official state scenic highway and remove the signs which so indicate the highway.



######### 262.1.  
A local agency, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 65402 of the Government Code, shall coordinate its planning with, and obtain the approval from, the appropriate local planning agency on the location and construction of any new district facility that would be within the scenic corridor of any state scenic highway.



######### 262.5.  
(a) Whenever the department determines that any state highway within or traversing United States National Forest lands meets the standards for official state scenic highways, the department shall designate the highway as an official state scenic highway and shall so indicate the highway in any publications of the department or in any maps which are issued by the department to the public.

(b) The department shall cause appropriate signs to be placed and maintained along those portions of the highways which the department has designated pursuant to subdivision (a) as official state scenic highways that indicate that those portions of the highways are official state scenic highways.

(c) If at any time the department determines that a state highway, designated as an official state scenic highway pursuant to subdivision (a), no longer meets the standards for official state scenic highways, it may revoke the designation of the highway as an official state highway and remove the signs which so indicate the highway.

######### 660.  
As used in this chapter:

(a) “Highway” includes all, or any part, of the entire width of the right-of-way of a state highway, whether or not the entire area is actually used for highway purposes.

(b) “Encroachment” includes any tower, pole, pole line, pipe, pipe line, fence, billboard, stand or building, or any structure, object of any kind or character not particularly mentioned in this section, or special event, which is in, under, or over any portion of the highway.  “Special event” means any street festival, sidewalk sale, community-sponsored activity, or community-approved activity.



######### 661.  
In addition to persons, public corporations, and districts specified in this chapter, this chapter shall apply to all private corporations authorized by law to establish or maintain any works or facilities in, under or over any public highway. This chapter shall not limit the powers and duties vested by law in the Public Utilities Commission of this State, and in the event of any conflict with regard to the powers and duties given the department in this chapter, those of the Public Utilities Commission shall prevail.

######### 670.  
(a) The department may issue written permits, as provided in this chapter, authorizing the permittee to do any of the following acts:

(1) Make an opening or excavation for any purpose in any state highway.

(2) Place, change, or renew an encroachment.

(3) Place or display in, under, or over any state highway any advertising sign or device.  Any advertising sign or device placed or displayed in violation of this section is a public nuisance and the department may immediately remove it.  This section does not prohibit the posting of any notice in the manner required by law or by the order of any court.

(4) Plant, remove, cut, cut down, injure, or destroy any tree, shrub, plant, or flower growing within any state highway.  However, the department shall not issue a permit for, or take any other action to accomplish, the destruction, removal, or topping of any tree, unless the tree is dead or diseased, for the purpose of improving or enhancing the view from the highway of an advertising sign or device or any commercial activity, unless, for any project whose cost is more than five hundred dollars ($500), the permittee has obtained consent from the city or county in which the tree is located. Nothing in this paragraph limits the department’s authority to modify or deny any permittee’s request.  If the city or county does not respond within 30 days to a request for a permit pursuant to this paragraph, the city or county is deemed to have given consent to the project.

(5) Install or remove tire chains upon motor vehicles for compensation on any state highway at locations designated in the permit, upon any terms and conditions relating to the safe and orderly movement of traffic that the department finds necessary.  The department may issue sufficient permits for the installation or removal of tire chains that it finds necessary or desirable to accommodate the demand for those services consistent with the maximum convenience and safety to traffic.  The department, in issuing any permit for the installation or removal of tire chains, shall assume no responsibility for the competence or reliability of the permittee in performing those services.

(b) Any person who does any act specified in this section without a permit is guilty of a misdemeanor.



######### 670.1.  
(a) The department may issue a permit to the owner or developer of property adjacent to or near a state highway to construct, alter, repair, or improve any portion of the highway for the purpose of improving local traffic access, if the improvements to the highway are required as part of, or as a condition to, the development of property and the improvements are accepted by the department.

(b) The permit may be issued only if the work within the highway right-of-way is to be performed in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the department and the department reserves the right to inspect and accept the work as complying with the approved plans and specifications.

(c) All road, bridge, street lighting, or installation of signal work performed under a permit issued pursuant to this section for acceptance into the state highway system, except work performed solely to allow private encroachments onto the state highway or for utility or drainage encroachments within the state highway, are public works for purposes of Part 7 (commencing with Section 1720) of Division 2 of the Labor Code.

######### 671.1.  
The department may establish a fee schedule and charge a fee for the issuance of permits pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, except that no such fee shall be charged by the department to any public corporation. The fee schedule established by the department shall not produce a total estimated revenue in excess of the estimated total cost to the department for administering the provisions of this chapter, excluding the cost of issuing permits exempted by statute or regulation from the payment of fees. Funds collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the State Highway Account in the State Transportation Fund.



######### 671.5.  
(a) The department shall either approve or deny an application from an applicant for an encroachment permit within 60 days of receiving a completed application, as determined by the department. An application for an encroachment permit is complete when all other statutory requirements, including the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code), have been complied with. The department’s failure to notify the applicant within that 60-day period that the permit is denied shall be deemed to constitute approval of the permit. Thereafter, upon notifying the department, the applicant may act in accordance with its permit application, as if the permit had been approved.

(b) All of the following shall apply to the department’s review of an application for an encroachment permit for a broadband facility:

(1) The department shall specify in writing all permit application criteria. It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure a streamlined, predictable, and expeditious process by which the department reviews broadband facility permit applications in order to achieve the rapid deployment of broadband facilities on highways.

(2) Within 30 days after an application for an encroachment permit for a broadband facility is submitted, the department shall notify the applicant in writing whether the permit application is deemed complete. If the department does not notify the applicant within that 30-day period that the application is incomplete, the failure to notify shall be deemed to constitute a finding that the permit application is complete.

(3) If the department deems a permit application incomplete, the department shall do all of the following:

(A) At the time of notifying the applicant that the application is incomplete, furnish to the applicant a detailed explanation why the application is incomplete, with reference to the specific application criteria that the application does not meet.

(D) Provide the applicant with no less than 30 days to resubmit its application with the supplemental information that the department identified in the notice. The applicant’s failure to respond with additional information during that period shall be deemed to constitute a withdrawal of the application.

(4) Within 30 days after receiving supplemental information from an applicant pursuant to paragraph (3), the department shall approve or deny the application.

(c) If the department denies an application for an encroachment permit, the department shall, at the time of notifying the applicant of the denial, furnish to the applicant a detailed explanation of the reason for the denial.

(d) The department shall adopt regulations prescribing procedures for an applicant to appeal to the director for a final determination of the department’s denial of an application. The appeal shall be made in writing to the director. There shall be a final written determination by the director within 60 calendar days after receipt of the applicant’s written appeal. The adopted regulations shall require the appellant to pay to the department a fee of not more than 50 percent of the estimated administrative cost to the department of conducting the appeal.

(e) Nothing in this section precludes an applicant and the department from mutually agreeing to an extension of any time limit provided by this section.



######### 672.  
Any permit issued under the provisions of this chapter may provide that the permittee will pay the entire expense of replacing the highway in as good condition as before, and may provide such other conditions as to the location and the manner in which the work is to be done as the department finds necessary for the protection of the highway.



######### 673.  
(a) Any permit issued to a permittee of the class specified in Section 678 shall contain a provision that in the event the future improvement of the highway necessitates the relocation or removal of the encroachment the permittee will relocate or remove the same at the permittee’s sole expense.  In that event, the department shall serve on the permittee its written demand specifying the place of relocation, or that the encroachment is to be removed from the highway, and specifying a reasonable time within which the work of relocation is to be commenced.  The permittee shall commence the relocation or removal within the time specified in that demand and thereafter diligently prosecute until completion.

(b) All permits, other than those issued to permittees of the class specified in Section 678 or the class specified in Section 680, are revocable on five days’ notice and the encroachment shall be removed or relocated as may be specified by the department in the notice revoking the permit and within the time specified by the department, which time shall not be less than five days, unless the permit so provides.

(c) The department may waive the requirement of subdivision (a) that the permittee bear the sole expense of relocating or removing an encroachment, if the encroachment consists of a track or roadway that serves as an exclusive public mass transit guideway owned, operated, and maintained by a publicly owned mass transit authority.



######### 674.  
The department may, but is not required to, supervise any work done under any permit, issued under the provisions of this chapter in which event the permittee shall, in addition to any fees charged pursuant to Section 671.1, pay the reasonable cost of such supervision to the department, but no cost of supervision shall be charged by the department to any public corporation.



######### 675.  
(a) Permittees may excavate openings in state highways to make repairs in cases of emergency requiring immediate action.  In such cases, the appropriate representative of the department shall be promptly notified of any such action, and such permittee, at his own expense, shall immediately replace the state highway in as good condition as before such excavation.

(b) A city or public corporation supplying water service to its inhabitants may, within its corporate limits, excavate a state highway without a permit in cases of emergency requiring immediate action.  In such cases, the state highway shall, at the expense of the city or public corporation, be replaced in as good condition as before such excavation.



######### 676.  
The department may delegate to any city any of the department’s powers, duties, and authority, other than those of approval, under this chapter as to any State highway, or any part thereof, within such city, and may withdraw any such delegation of authority.



######### 677.  
Before granting a permit under any provision of this chapter, the department may require the applicant to file with the department a satisfactory bond payable to the people of the State of California in such amount as the department deems sufficient, conditioned on the proper compliance by the permittee with the provisions of this article.



######### 678.  
Except as otherwise provided in this section, such a bond shall not be required of any county, city, public corporation or political subdivision which is authorized by law to establish or maintain any works or facilities in, under or over any public highway, nor shall the application of any such governmental unit for a permit be denied. Every such applicant is entitled as a matter of right to a permit, but is otherwise subject to the provisions of this article and to all reasonable conditions and provisions made by the department in any such permit.

The department may require of any such applicant a bond in a sum not to exceed twenty thousand dollars, if such applicant has in fact prior to such application failed to comply with the provisions of this article or with the provisions of a previous permit.



######### 679.  
Any city, municipal utility district, municipal water district or metropolitan water district is entitled to a blanket permit, renewable annually, for the installation of its service connections and for ordinary maintenance of its facilities located or installed in State highways; but the department may revoke any such blanket permit if the permittee fails to comply with the provisions of this article. When any such permit is revoked in a proper case such municipal utility district, municipal water district or metropolitan water district is entitled to a permit only on furnishing a bond as provided in section 677.



######### 680.  
Whenever a franchise is granted by any county or city in any public highway which has been or is subsequently constituted a state highway, the department may enforce any obligations of the grantee or holder of the franchise with respect to the repair of the highway. The department may require any person who has placed and maintained any pole, pole line, pipe, pipeline, conduit, street railroad tracks, or other structures or facilities upon any state highway, whether under that or any franchise, to move it at his or her own cost and expense to such different location in the highway as is specified in a written demand of the department, whenever necessary to insure the safety of the traveling public or to permit the improvement of the highway. However, no such change of location shall be required for a temporary purpose. The department shall specify in the demand a reasonable time within which the work of relocation shall be commenced and the grantee or owner shall commence the relocation within the time specified in the demand and thereafter diligently prosecute it to completion.

In case the owner fails to comply with any such demand, the encroachments specified in the demand become subject to Article 3 (commencing with Section 720), except that no further notice is required.



######### 680.5.  
The department and any utility as defined in Section 700 may enter into a contract for or apportioning the obligations and costs to be borne by each party for the removal, relocation or repair of facilities whenever necessary to accommodate any or all state highways which are not freeways, to the same extent and in the same manner as is authorized for state freeways in Section 707.5.



######### 681.  
Whenever a franchise shall have been granted by any county or city in any public highway heretofore or hereafter constituted a State highway, all of the rights of the grantor under such franchise, including the right to collect and receive tolls, charges or payments thereunder other than the rights transferred to the department by section 680, are reserved to such county or city.



######### 682.  
Every city and county shall have power to grant franchises authorizing the exercise of any privilege in, along, across, under, through, over, and upon any state highway, or portion thereof, within its boundaries to the extent and in the manner that it shall have power to grant franchises authorizing the exercise of such privilege in, over, and upon city streets, or county highways, as the case may be, subject to the conditions and limitations provided in Sections 682 to 695, inclusive.



######### 682.5.  
(a) Notwithstanding Section 731, the department may issue permits to counties and cities for the use of highways within their boundaries and to community-based nonprofit corporations for special events upon terms and conditions relating to the safe and orderly movement of traffic that the department finds necessary.  A city or county or a community-based nonprofit corporation issued a permit may allow or conduct vending on or adjacent to the highway immediately preceding, during, or immediately following the permitted special event in accordance with the terms and conditions specified by the department in the permit.

Not more than four permits for the same activity at the same location shall be issued to any city or county or community-based nonprofit corporation in any calendar year.  No permit shall be issued to a community-based nonprofit corporation unless that corporation has been issued an acknowledgment by the city or county within which the special event is proposed to be conducted.

Neither the department, in issuing permits for the use of highways, nor the city or county, in issuing acknowledgments, shall be responsible for the conduct or operation of the permitted activity and shall require the permit applicant to agree to indemnify and hold harmless the state and the city or county against any and all claims arising out of any activity for which the permit is issued.

(b) As used in this section,“community-based nonprofit corporation” means a corporation formed under the Nonprofit Corporation Law (Division 2 (commencing with Section 5000) of the Corporations Code) having an office located within the county within which the special event is to be held.

The department shall not approve a permit for an event that does not comply with this condition.



######### 683.  
No franchise of any kind shall be granted in respect to any State highway or portion thereof which has been established as a freeway pursuant to the provisions of this code without the prior approval in writing of the department, except for crossings as provided in Section 685.

No franchise shall be granted for the installation of street or other railroad tracks or the operation of street railroads or other railroads on any State highway without the prior approval in writing of the department except for crossings as provided in Section 685.

In case a franchise is granted for the exercise of a privilege in a city street or county highway, approval of the department shall not be required in respect to intersections. Franchises may be granted extending across the common area of the intersection without any such approval. In cases where the grades of the state highway and the city street or county highway are separated, the franchise shall be exercised only on the city street or county highway.



######### 686.  
The department shall approve any franchise submitted for approval pursuant to Section 683 or 684 unless the department finds on the facts of the particular case that the exercise of the privilege proposed to be granted is incompatible with the primary use of the freeway or other State highway for vehicular traffic or with its improvement to serve its primary use.



######### 687.  
Franchises may be granted under this article separately as to any state highway, or portion thereof, or in respect to both state highways, or portions thereof, and city streets or county highways.



######### 688.  
In cases in which the approval of the department is not required, the city or county shall give notice to the department of any application for a franchise affecting a state highway at the time of the filing of such application by any applicant, so that the department may present to the legislative body of the city or county, as the case may be, any considerations by it deemed to be important. Such notice shall be given to the appropriate district director.



######### 689.  
No privilege shall be exercised in any state highway pursuant to any franchise granted under this article until a copy of such franchise, certified by the clerk of the grantor city or county, has been filed with the department. This may be filed with the district director.



######### 690.  
The department shall have the power to prescribe the location, within the limits of the State highway, of any physical property to be constructed or installed in, under, over or upon such State highway pursuant to any such franchise. Before constructing or installing any such physical property in any State highway, the holder of the franchise shall apply to the department, or its authorized agent, for a permit, and the department shall issue a permit, in which it may impose reasonable conditions as to location, method and manner of construction. All such physical property is subject to relocation in the cases and in the manner provided in Section 680.



######### 691.  
In the exercise within the limits of any State highway of any privilege granted by franchise, the holder thereof shall at all times be subject to all reasonable orders, rules and regulations of the department for the protection, maintenance or improvement of the highway or the safe and convenient use thereof as a public highway.

All sums payable by the grantee under any such franchise shall be paid to the grantor city or county.



######### 694.  
All franchises heretofore granted by any city for the exercise of any privilege in any State highway, are hereby fully validated, legalized and made effective, to the same extent that such city at the time of making the grant had power to grant a franchise authorizing the exercise of such privilege in, over and upon city streets.



######### 695.  
Failure of the department to act upon any application for approval under Sections 683 or 684 within 90 days after the filing of such application with the department shall be deemed to constitute approval thereof.

Whenever the department requires a privately owned utility to relocate within a freeway any utility facility used solely to supply water, which facility is lawfully maintained in any freeway which was not a state highway at the time such utility facility was originally installed therein, the department shall pay the cost of such relocation.

Whenever the department requires a privately owned utility to relocate within a freeway any utility facility, other than one used solely to supply water, which facility is lawfully maintained in any freeway which was not a state highway at the time such utility facility was originally installed therein, and it is established by the utility that it is not under express contractual obligation to relocate such facility at its own expense, the department shall pay the cost of such relocation.

A permit containing a contractual obligation which was accepted by the utility for maintenance or minor improvement of the facility after such road became a state highway shall not constitute a contractual obligation within the meaning of this section.

Publicly owned sewers and fire hydrants and any street lighting structure, whether publicly or privately owned, in any freeway shall be relocated, where necessary, at the expense of the department.



######### 704.  
If the department requires the relocation within the right of way of any utility facility more than once within a period of 10 years, the department shall pay the cost of the second relocation and any subsequent relocation within such 10-year period.



######### 705.  
In any case in which the department is required under the provisions of this article to pay the cost of removal or relocation of any utility facility, it shall be entitled to credits as follows:

(1) In the amount of any betterment to the utility facility resulting from such removal or relocation, not in excess of the cost of the increased capacity of the facility.

(2) The salvage value of any materials or parts salvaged and retained by the utility.

(3) If a new facility or portion thereof is constructed to accomplish such removal or relocation, an allowance of an amount bearing the same proportion to the original cost of the displaced facility or portion thereof as the age thereof bears to the normal expected life thereof.

A credit shall not be allowed against any portion of the cost which is otherwise chargeable to the utility.

A credit allowance for age shall not be applied to publicly owned sewers.



######### 706.  
The department and any utility required to remove a utility facility or to relocate any utility facility may, by agreement, provide for the respective amounts of the cost to be borne by each. The department may, without prejudice to its rights under Section 707, advance the cost of removal or relocation and if the department advances such cost, it is the duty of the utility to move its facilities as soon as reasonably possible so as not to delay freeway construction. In the case of any utility which is not financially able to bear the costs of removal or relocation, the department may by agreement provide for the work to be done on condition that the utility’s portion of the costs be repaid to the department over a period of time not exceeding 10 years.

Either party may maintain an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for an adjudication as to the obligations and costs to be borne by each party under such provisions of said contract at any time within four years after the cause of action first arose thereunder.  Such a cause of action shall be deemed to arise upon and at the time of the completion by the utility of the removal or relocation in question, or at the time of breach of the agreement by either party.  The filing of a claim with any state agency shall not be deemed a condition precedent to the maintenance by the utility of any such action.



######### 706.5.  
In connection with the construction of State Highway Route 86 in Imperial County from Post Miles 58.4 to Post Miles 65.1 and the relocation of facilities of the Coachella Valley Water District necessitated by that project, the department may make a loan, for a term not exceeding 20 years, to the district for the relocation costs incurred, and to be incurred, by the district as a result of that project. The loan shall be subject to the terms and conditions that are mutually agreed upon, but shall require the district, in addition to making periodic payments on the loan, to annually pay to the department an amount at least equal to the sum of the pipeline portion of all development fees collected by the district during the preceding year in the service area served by the transverse waterline crossing of State Highway Route 86, less the district’s administrative and collection costs. The amounts so paid shall be deducted from the outstanding balance of the loan, and the remaining term of the loan correspondingly reduced.



######### 707.  
In the event of failure to reach an agreement as provided in Section 706, the utility or the department may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for apportionment of the cost between them in accordance with the provisions of this article. Such an action may be commenced within three years from the date of completion by the utility of the removal or relocation in question. The filing of a claim with any state agency shall not be deemed a condition precedent to the maintenance by the utility of any such action.



######### 707.5.  
(A) The department and any utility as defined in Section 700 of this code may enter into a contract providing for or apportioning the obligations and costs to be borne by each party as to either or both of the following subject matters:

(1) Any or all removals or relocations of any utility facilities completed by the utility prior to the effective date of such contract as required by notice given by the department wherever necessary to accommodate any or all state freeways, where:  (a) the obligations or costs in respect thereto to be borne by each party is in dispute; and (b) the claim of the utility is:  (i) founded upon a removal or relocation completed by the utility not longer than three years immediately preceding the effective date of such contract; or (ii) involved in an action pending in a court of competent jurisdiction if such action was commenced within three years after completion by the utility of the removal or relocation in question; and

(2) Any or all removals or relocations of any utility facilities to be undertaken or completed by the utility after the effective date of such contract as required by notice given by the department wherever necessary to accommodate any or all state freeways.

(B) Those provisions of any such contract settling the claims of the parties in respect to any or all removals or relocations of any utility facilities completed by the utility prior to the effective date of such contract, as authorized in subdivision (A) (1) of this section, shall be irrevocable after the execution of such contract, except as the same may be changed or modified by mutual consent of the parties in writing; and either party may maintain an action in a court of competent jurisdiction upon such provisions of said contract at any time within two years after the effective date of such contract, and the utility need file no claim with any state agency as a condition precedent to the maintenance of any such action.

(C) Those provisions of any such contract dealing with any or all removals or relocations of any utility facilities to be undertaken or completed by the utility after the effective date of such contract, as authorized in subdivision (A) (2) of this section, shall be under and subject to the following limitations and requirements:

(1) While such provisions of said contract remain in effect, such provisions shall govern exclusively the determination of the obligations and costs to be borne by each party in regard to every removal or relocation covered thereby undertaken or completed by the utility after the effective date of such contract, whether notice in respect thereto was given by the department to the utility before or after the effective date of such contract, in lieu of the determination thereof under the foregoing provisions of this article as now or hereafter existing and any and all other laws which would be applicable to said subject matter but for said contract, save to the extent that any such laws may be referred to, retained, and made applicable by, such provisions of said contracts; provided: (a) where before the effective date of a contract entered into under this section the parties executed an agreement in respect to the obligations and costs to be borne by each party as to a particular removal or relocation under a notice given by the department, the provisions of such last mentioned agreement shall govern as to the obligations and costs to be borne by each party in respect thereto; and (b) where a particular notice given by the department before the effective date of a contract entered into under this section specifies a removal or relocation to be made at the expense of the utility, the utility shall be and remain bound thereby unless the utility advised the department in writing of its disagreement with such determination within the time specified in any agreement then in effect between the department and the utility in respect to the procedure to be followed in such cases, or, if none, within a reasonable time after receipt by the utility of said notice.

(2) Either party may maintain an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for an adjudication as to the obligations and costs to be borne by each party under such provisions of said contract at any time within four years after the cause of action first arose thereunder.  Such a cause of action shall be deemed to arise upon and at the time of the completion by the utility of the removal or relocation in question.  The filing of a claim with any state agency shall not be deemed a condition precedent to the maintenance by the utility of any such action.

(3) Such provisions of said contract shall terminate:  (i) automatically upon the repeal of this section or of subdivisions (A) (2) and (C) hereof; and (ii) also, unless sooner so automatically terminated, at such time or in such manner as may be provided in said contract; and in the event of either such termination, the laws applicable to the subject matter of such provisions of said contract as existing at the time of such termination shall thereafter govern, save as to removals or relocations theretofore required of the utility by the department under notice mailed or delivered to the utility prior to such termination, whether work upon such removal or relocation has theretofore commenced, is in progress, or has been completed.



######### 708.  
Every utility is entitled to a permit for such reasonable crossings of any freeway, as may be required for the proper discharge of the utility’s service to the public.



######### 709.  
The department shall exercise a reasonable discretion in acting on applications of utilities for permits to occupy freeways for longitudinal locations of facilities, as may be required for the proper discharge of their services to the public. The department may, however, refuse to grant any applications for any such longitudinal installation which would be inconsistent with public safety or the continued unobstructed use of the freeway for vehicular traffic, or for any type of utility structure inconsistent with the aesthetic values of any landscaped freeway within, or approaching within one mile of, the limits of any city.



######### 710.  
The department, in acting upon applications for utility permits, shall consider both the interests of the traveling public upon the freeway and the needs of consumers for public utility services.



######### 711.  
Nothing in this article is intended to prevent the department from making reasonable rules and regulations and requiring reasonable conditions in permits concerning the place, manner and method of location of utility facilities in, under, over or along freeways. Specifically, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the department may make regulations or require conditions to the end that the cutting of pavement on freeways and a consequential impairment of the use thereof by the traveling public, shall be avoided insofar as possible.

Any such notice shall describe the encroachment complained of with reasonable certainty as to its character and location.  In lieu of service upon such person, service of such notice may also be made by registered mail and by posting, for a period of five days, a copy of the notice on the encroachment described in the notice.

When notice thereof is given by the department, in the manner provided by section 720, to any person permitting or suffering such damage to be done to any State highway, or permitting or suffering any such condition to exist, such person shall immediately cease and discontinue such diversion of waters or shall discontinue and prevent such drainage, seepage, or overflow and shall repair the highway at his own expense.



######### 727.  
If a person is thus notified, and fails, neglects, or refuses to cease and discontinue the diversion, to discontinue and prevent the drainage, seepage, or overflow of the waters, or to make the repairs required by Section 726, the department may make the repairs and may also perform work as is necessary to prevent the further drainage, diversion, overflow, or seepage of the waters.

The department, in the name of the people of the State of California, may recover in an action at law, in a court of competent jurisdiction, the amount expended for the repairs and work and, in addition thereto, the sum of three hundred fifty dollars ($350) for each day the drainage, diversion, overflow or seepage of waters is permitted to continue after the service of the notice in the manner required by Section 726, together with the costs and expenses incurred in the action.

Upon the neglect or refusal of any person to comply with the provisions of section 728, the department may construct any such crossing and may recover, in the name of the people of the State of California, in an action at law in any court of competent jurisdiction, the expense of such construction, together with the costs and expenses incurred in any such action.



######### 730.  
Any person who by any means wilfully or negligently injures or damages any State highway is liable for the repair thereof, and the department, in the name of the people of the State of California, may recover, in an action in any court of competent jurisdiction, the amount expended for such repairs, together with the costs and expenses incurred in any such action.

Any person wilfully injuring any bridge, culvert or structure in or on any State highway is guilty of a misdemeanor.

Any vehicle or structure parked or placed wholly or partly within any state highway, for the purpose of selling the same or of selling therefrom or therein any article, service or thing, is a public nuisance and the department may immediately remove that vehicle or structure from within any highway.

Any person parking any vehicle or placing any structure wholly or partly within any highway for the purpose of selling that vehicle or structure, or of selling therefrom or therein any article or thing, and any person selling, displaying for sale, or offering for sale any article or thing either in or from that vehicle or structure so parked or placed, and any person storing, servicing, repairing or otherwise working upon any vehicle, other than upon a vehicle which is temporarily disabled, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

The California Highway Patrol and all peace officers from local law enforcement agencies may enforce the provisions of this chapter with respect to highways under their respective jurisdiction and shall cooperate with the department to that end. Whenever any member of the California Highway Patrol or any peace officer from a local law enforcement agency removes a vehicle from a highway under the provisions of this section, then all of the provisions of Article 3 (commencing with Section 22850), Chapter 10, Division 11 of the Vehicle Code with reference to the removal of a vehicle from a highway shall be applicable.

This section does not prohibit a seller from taking orders or delivering any commodity from a vehicle on that part of any state highway immediately adjacent to the premises of the purchaser; prohibit an owner or operator of a vehicle, or a mechanic, from servicing, repairing or otherwise working upon any vehicle which is temporarily disabled in a manner and to an extent that it is impossible to avoid stopping that vehicle within the highway; or prohibit coin-operated public telephones and related telephone structures in park and ride lots, vista points, and truck inspection facilities within state highway rights-of-way for use by the general public.

##### ARTICLE 4. Protection of Beds of Mapped Highways [740 - 742]  

######### 740.  
As used in this article:

“Mapped highway” means a highway which is laid out, surveyed, and delineated on a map of such size, scale, and detail that the exact location on the ground which the highway is to occupy can be ascertained.

“Map” includes plat.

“Owner” includes any person entitled to the use or possession of real property.



######### 740.2.  
Whenever the department has laid out and surveyed a proposed state highway in any county or city it shall prepare a map of such highway sufficient to show the location of such highway on each parcel of land to be traversed or otherwise occupied by the highway when constructed.



######### 740.4.  
The department shall transmit a copy of such map insofar as it relates to the land within a county to the planning commission of the county.

The planning commission of such county shall thereafter prepare a precise plan showing such planned right-of-way in conformity with Section 65600 of the Government Code, and the board of supervisors shall thereafter adopt such precise plan in the manner provided in Article 11 (commencing with Section 65600), Chapter 3, Title 7 of the Government Code.

Thereafter, the planning commission shall also notify the department of any application for a building permit for a building costing five thousand dollars ($5,000) or more in sufficient time to give the department an opportunity to purchase the right-of-way from such applicant.  Upon adoption of a resolution by the board of supervisors, the notice to the department may be given by any other officer, board, commission, or department designated for that purpose by the resolution.



######### 740.5.  
The department shall transmit a copy of such map, insofar as it relates to the land within a city, to the planning commission of the city or, if the city has not created a planning commission, to the governing body of the city.

The planning commission of such city or, if the city has not created a planning commission, the governing body of such city acting as a planning commission, shall thereafter notify the department of any application for a building permit for a building costing five thousand dollars ($5,000) or more in sufficient time to give the department an opportunity to purchase the right-of-way from such applicant.

The notices required to be given by the planning commission, or by the governing body acting as a planning commission, may be given by any other officer, board, commission, or department designated for that purpose by resolution of the governing body.



######### 740.6.  
A copy of the precised plan shall be filed with the agency of the county charged with the duty of issuing building permits for buildings in unincorporated areas in the county, or, if no such agency exists in the county, with the county surveyor.



######### 740.8.  
No person shall hereafter erect any building or structure, other than a temporary structure costing less than five hundred dollars ($500) without a permit to do so. If no other agency is charged with the duty of issuing such permits the county surveyor shall have such duty.



######### 741.  
Prior to issuing a building permit the officer whose function is to issue such permits shall examine the precised plan and if he finds that the building or structure proposed to be erected will lie within the boundaries of the mapped highway he shall grant the permit if the cost of the proposed building or structure is five hundred dollars ($500) or less. Otherwise he shall refuse such permit and notify the applicant for the permit of the reason for such refusal.



######### 741.2.  
Any person aggrieved by the refusal of a building permit under this article may request a hearing on the matter by an appeals board. Except as hereinafter provided the governing body of the county is the appeals board for the county. If the governing body of any county determines that the number of hearings requested is so numerous that they cannot be handled expeditiously by such body, it shall appoint an appeals board to conduct such hearings.



######### 741.4.  
The appeals board shall grant the permit if any of the following are true:

(a) That the property of which the mapped highway location is a part is of such nature that the owner of the land will be substantially damaged by the refusal to grant the permit.

(b) That the property will not earn a fair return on the owner’s investment unless the construction involved is authorized.

(c) That, balancing the interests of the public in preserving the integrity of the officially mapped highway against the interest of the owner of the land in using his property, the granting of the permit is required by considerations of justice and equity.



######### 741.6.  
The appeals board shall not grant the permit if any of the following are true:

(a) That the owner of the land will not be substantially damaged by locating the proposed structure on his land outside of the lines of the mapped highway.

(b) That, balancing the interests of the public in preserving the integrity of the mapped highway against the interest of the land owner in using his property as proposed to be used, the resulting disadvantages to the State would be unreasonably disproportionate to the advantages to the owner to be derived from so using the property.



######### 741.7.  
Nothing in this article shall be deemed a condition precedent to the acquisition of rights of way by purchase or by proceedings in eminent domain.



######### 741.8.  
Nothing in this article shall be construed to restrict the right of any person to seek declaratory relief pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure or to avail himself of any other legal or equitable remedy applicable to his particular case.

(b) A junkyard which is lawfully in existence at any time but later fails to comply with the requirements of this article due to special conditions as defined in subdivision (f) of Section 746.



######### 746.2.  
Nonconforming junkyards may continue in existence as long as they are not extended, enlarged, or changed in use, and are otherwise lawfully maintained.

The width of all county highways, other than bridges, alleys, lanes, and trails, shall be at least 40 feet, except as provided by Sections 906.5 and 969 and except that the board of supervisors of any county may, by a resolution passed by a unanimous vote of its members, determine that the public convenience and necessity demand the maintenance of a highway of less than 40 feet and may after such determination proceed with the maintenance of any such highway.

This section shall not increase or diminish the width of any county highway established, dedicated, and maintained as such prior to January 1, 1945.



######### 906.5.  
On construction under a contract advertised for bids after July 1, 1973, the board of supervisors shall install on the surface of county highways upon which the operation of bicycles is permitted only those types of grates which are not hazardous to bicycle riders.



######### 906.6.  
Notwithstanding Section 906, a county may maintain a highway of less than 40 feet in width if all the cost of maintenance thereof is paid for by a maintenance district created pursuant to Chapter 26 (commencing with Section 5820) of Part 3 of Division 1.



######### 907.  
Any owner or occupant of land may construct a sidewalk on the county highway along the line of his land, subject to the authority conferred by law on the board of supervisors.



######### 908.  
The road commissioner, or the person to whom the duties of the road commissioner have been transferred pursuant to Section 2006.1 or 2006.5, shall maintain a record of each county highway, including its name and a general reference to its terminal points.



######### 909.  
No agreement entered into by the board of supervisors for the purchase, hire, or rental of any apparatus used in the construction, improvement, or maintenance of highways shall create a charge against the county, unless the agreement complies with all of the following:

(a) The agreement is in writing.

(b) The writing is signed by the chair of the board of supervisors.

(c) A copy of the writing is certified by and filed with the clerk of the board of supervisors.

All of these writings and copies are public documents.

If a county purchases, hires, or rents any apparatus specified herein pursuant to a local purchasing ordinance, including competitive bidding procedures, it does not have to comply with subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) herein to create a charge against the county.  Compliance with the local purchasing ordinance shall be sufficient to create a charge against the county for said purchase, hire, or rental.







##### CHAPTER 2. Powers and Duties of Boards of Supervisors [940 - 991]  

######### 940.  
Boards of supervisors shall have general supervision, management, and control of the county highways.



######### 941.  
(a) Boards of supervisors shall, by proper order, cause those highways which are necessary to public convenience to be established, recorded, constructed, and maintained in the manner provided in this division.

(b) No public or private road shall become a county highway until and unless the board of supervisors, or its designee, by appropriate action, has caused the road to be accepted into the county road system.  No county shall be held liable for failure to maintain any road unless and until it has been accepted into the county road system by action of the board of supervisors or its designee.

(c) The acceptance of any road or the acceptance of any road subject to improvements pursuant to Section 66477.1 of the Government Code does not constitute the acceptance of the road into the county road system in the absence of the adoption of a resolution by the board of supervisors accepting the road into the county road system.

(d) In lieu of the procedures set forth in subdivisions (b) or (c), boards of supervisors may, by ordinance, designate a county officer to accept, on behalf of the board, roads or portions thereof, into the county road system and to record conveyances to the county of real property interests for road uses and purposes.  The designee shall, prior to recording any conveyance under this section, affix a certificate to the instrument stating the acceptance into the county road system and designating the name or number, or both, of the county road.  The designee shall report all acceptances and recordings to the board at the end of the fiscal year, or at more frequent intervals as determined by the board.



######### 941.1.  
The board of supervisors may lay out, acquire, construct, and maintain any section or portion of any street or highway within the county as a freeway or expressway and may make any existing street or highway a freeway or expressway.



######### 941.2.  
Boards of supervisors may close any street or highway within their jurisdiction at or near the point of its intersection with any freeway, or may make provision for carrying such street or highway over, under, or to a connection with the freeway, and may do any and all work on such street or highway as is necessary therefor.

No public highway shall be converted into a freeway except with the consent of the owners of abutting lands or the purchase or condemnation of their right of access thereto.



######### 941.3.  
Before taking any action authorized by Section 941.2 affecting any state highway, such action must be approved by the Department of Public Works.



######### 941.4.  
(a) The board of supervisors, with the consent of any city in which the proposed system is located, in whole or in part, may designate a system of expressways within the county.  The designation shall be based on a study of the transportation needs of the county, which shall  include a financing plan for the expressway system.

(b) The purpose of the county expressway system is to provide a level of service that is greater than that of city streets and county roads, but less than that provided by the state system of freeways.  The designated county expressway system shall serve both incorporated and unincorporated areas of a county, as appropriate.

(c) The board of supervisors may enter into an agreement with the city council or other governing body of a city to close any city street at or near its intersection with an expressway or to provide for carrying the street over, under, or to a connection with the expressway, and to perform any work necessary for this purpose.  No city street may be closed by the construction of an expressway except pursuant to such an agreement.  No city street may be connected with an expressway unless the board of supervisors, by resolution, consents and specifies the terms and conditions of that connection.  The board of supervisors may permit or prohibit, or specify the terms and conditions of, a connection as, in its opinion, will best serve the public interest of the county.  This subdivision does not apply to any connection constructed prior to January 1, 1989.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, the designated county expressway system may be planned, designed, acquired, constructed, reconstructed, rehabilitated, maintained, operated, and owned by the county in both incorporated and unincorporated areas.

(e) The board of supervisors may delegate any authority under this section to any local agency which it finds and determines has the capability to plan, design, acquire, construct, reconstruct, rehabilitate, maintain, operate, and own an expressway.

(f) The boards of supervisors of two or more adjacent counties into which an expressway is proposed to extend may enter into an agreement to plan, design, acquire, construct, reconstruct, rehabilitate, maintain, operate, or own the expressway.  The agreement shall provide for the creation of a governing body with representation from each county.

(g) Any county having an existing expressway system which was designated by the board of supervisors before January 1, 1989, shall be deemed to have met the conditions of this section.  Any new expressway project within such a system is subject to this section.

(h) As used in this section, “expressway” means a highway having partial or complete control of access, whether or not divided or with separations of grade at intersections.



######### 941.6.  
If the boundary line between two adjacent counties lies within a county highway, the boards of supervisors of the affected counties may, by agreement, provide for the improvement, maintenance, construction, or reconstruction of all or part of the highway by either or both counties, and each county may expend funds available to it for the improvements and maintenance of county highways as necessary for its performance of the agreement.



######### 942.  
Such boards may enact and enforce ordinances and regulations for the construction, improvement or maintenance of county highways, and for the protection, supervision, management, control, or use of such highways. Any such board may by a four-fifths vote of all its members let county equipment used in the maintenance and construction of county roads, when such equipment is not in use upon the roads under the jurisdiction of the board, and may charge for the use thereof a rental, and arrange the basis of compensation, in keeping with the general conditions prevailing in the county in which the transaction is made.



######### 942.5.  
The board of supervisors may restrict the use of, or close, any county highway whenever the board considers such closing or restriction of use necessary:

(a) For the protection of the public.

(b) For the protection of such county highway from damage during storms.

(c) During construction, improvement or maintenance operations thereon.

No liability shall attach to the county, or to the board of supervisors, for the restriction of use, or closing, of any county highway for the above public purposes.

This section does not constitute a change in, but is declaratory of, the pre-existing law.



######### 942.6.  
The board of supervisors may delegate the powers contained in Section 942.5 to the county road commissioner.



######### 943.  
Such board may:

(a) Acquire any property necessary for the uses and purposes of county highways.  When eminent domain proceedings are necessary, the board shall require the district attorney to institute such proceedings.  The expense of and award in such proceedings may be paid from the road fund or the general fund of the county, or the road fund of any district benefited.

(b) Lay out, construct, improve, and maintain county highways.

(c) Incur a bonded indebtedness for any of such purposes, subject to the provisions of Section 944.

(d) Construct and maintain stock trails approximately paralleling any county highway, retain and maintain for stock trails the right-of-way of any county highway which is superseded by relocation.  Such stock trail shall not be included in the term “maintained mileage of county roads” as that term is used in Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 2100) of Division 3 of this code.



######### 944.  
No bonded indebtedness shall be incurred for any purpose specified in section 943 until after the question of the issue of bonds therefor has been submitted to the qualified electors of the county, at the next general election or at a special election called for that purpose, and two-thirds of the electors of the county voting at such election have voted in favor of issuing such bonds. The election shall be called and held and the bonds, if authorized, shall be issued, sold, and made payable as prescribed by law.



######### 945.  
Such boards may expend from the county general fund the moneys necessary to pay the whole or any part of the cost of the improvement of any highway lying within any city in the county, whenever any real property belonging to the county and used for public purposes is included within the assessment district formed to pay for any such improvement. Such expenditures shall not exceed the amount which, but for such public ownership and use, would be properly chargeable to and assessed against such real property under the provisions of the law governing such improvement.



######### 946.  
No liability shall be created against the county in connection with any such improvement conducted by a city unless the board, by resolution, determines and declares the amount to be expended and directs that such sum be set apart and reserved out of any moneys available for such purpose in the general fund of the county, to be used exclusively for paying the expense of such improvement.



######### 947.  
Every instrument or judgment which constitutes evidence of title to a right of way, or incident thereto, in relation to county highways shall particularly describe the lands included in such right of way or incident.



######### 948.  
The board of supervisors of each county shall cause to be recorded with the county recorder, in relation to every county highway within the county, proper evidences of title to every right-of-way, and all incidents thereto. The board of supervisors may, by ordinance, delegate this duty to a county officer or employee.

In cases of acquisitions by conveyance or condemnation, the property or incidents conveyed or condemned shall be particularly described in the instruments recorded.



######### 949.  
The board of supervisors may plant shade and ornamental trees on the county highways, and provide for their care. The cost of planting and caring for such trees may be paid from the county general fund.

The board may also encourage, under such regulations as it adopts, the planting and preservation of shade and ornamental trees on the county highways, and may pay a sum not exceeding one dollar to any person planting and cultivating a living tree, payment to be made when the tree is four years of age.



######### 950.  
For the purpose of sprinkling county highways with oil or water, the board of supervisors may erect or maintain waterworks, tanks or reservoirs, and may purchase or lease real or personal property therefor.

The board may charge the cost of erecting or maintaining such waterworks, tanks or reservoirs and of such sprinkling to the county general fund, the road fund, or the district fund of any district benefited.



######### 951.  
(a) Such board may set apart on any county highway a strip of land for a side path, and make an order designating the width of such path, and cause the lines separating the path from the highway to be located and marked by stakes, posts, curbs, dikes, trees, or other physical delineations, placed at such distances apart as the board considers proper.

(b) After a path is set apart, and the lines separating it from the highway are located and marked, as provided in subdivision (a) of this section, the use of such path is restricted to pedestrians, riders of horses, and riders of vehicles propelled solely by the power of the rider.

(c) The board may charge the expense of erecting and maintaining such path to the county general fund, the road fund, or the district fund of any district benefited.



######### 952.  
Such board shall cause properly inscribed guideposts to be erected and maintained at all county highway crossings and forks lying outside of any city.



######### 953.  
A board of supervisors may, acting separately or in conjunction with State or Federal agencies, or with another county, burn or remove debris, rubbish, brush, and grass from the county highways. When acting in conjunction with other agencies or counties, a board may so act outside its county.

The expense incurred by a county, acting pursuant to this section, shall be paid out of any road fund of the county.  When a county is acting in conjunction with another agency or county the share of the expense to be borne by each shall be arrived at by agreement.



######### 954.  
All county highways which for a period of five consecutive years are impassable for vehicular travel, and on which during such period of time no public money is expended for maintenance, are unnecessary highways. The board of supervisors of any county on its own motion, or on the petition of any interested taxpayer of the county, may designate such county highway a stock trail. The board of supervisors shall cause notices to be posted upon such stock trails, and also at the entrance of such stock trails, directing all persons to drive all untethered stock thereon.

After a stock trail has been established or designated as provided in this chapter, the county is not liable for death or injury to a vehicle owner or operator or passenger, or for damage to a vehicle or its contents, resulting from a dangerous condition of the stock trail.

Such stock trails shall not be included in the term “maintained mileage of county roads” as that term is used in Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 2100) of Division 3.



######### 954.5.  
(a) The board of supervisors may, by resolution, terminate the maintenance of any county highway if it finds that the highway is unnecessary for the public convenience.

(b) Evidence that a county highway is unnecessary for the public convenience shall be taken at a public hearing set in accordance with the procedures for vacation of a public street, highway, or service easement in Sections 8323 and 8324.  Notice of the hearing shall be mailed to the owner of any property served by that portion of a county highway subject to the termination of maintenance.  A county highway may be deemed unnecessary for the public convenience on the basis  of any of the following:

(1) The county highway does not provide the primary access to occupied properties.

(2) Traffic on the county highway is intermittent and of low volume.

(3) The county highway is impassable for more than six months and there is no demand that it be reopened.

(c) A certified copy of the resolution terminating maintenance shall be recorded as provided in Section 8325.

(d) If the board of supervisors resumes maintenance of a county highway on which maintenance was terminated under this section, a notice of maintenance shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder.

(e) If a determination is made that maintenance is no longer necessary, the county shall post signs clearly visible from the traveled highway at each intersection of the highway for which maintenance is being terminated with a maintained highway indicating that the county no longer maintains the highway.  The sign shall read as follows:  “This road is not maintained.  ____ County is not responsible for any loss or injury suffered by reason of its use.”  The county shall provide adequate maintenance to ensure that the signs remain posted in the appropriate places and the message is legible for a period of one year.  Once such action is taken and duly recorded and the required signs are posted, the county shall not be held liable for the death of or injury to a vehicle owner, operator, or passenger, or for damage to a vehicle or its contents, resulting from a dangerous condition on such highway.



######### 954.6.  
(a) A board of supervisors, by resolution, may terminate the maintenance of all or a portion of a county highway if it finds that another public agency will maintain the highway or that portion of it pursuant to an agreement meeting the requirements of Section 941.6.  The resolution terminating maintenance shall identify the county highway, or portion of it, for which maintenance will be terminated and also the agency that will perform the maintenance.  A certified copy of the resolution shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder.

(b) As to each county highway, or portion of a county highway, for which the board terminates maintenance pursuant to subdivision (a), the county shall post signs at each intersection of that highway with a maintained highway, if any, indicating that the county no longer maintains the highway.  The signs shall be clearly visible from the traveled highway and shall read:  “This road not maintained by ____ County.  ____ County is not responsible for any loss or injury resulting from use of this road.”  The county shall provide adequate maintenance for the signs to ensure that for a period of one year each sign remains posted in the appropriate place and the message is legible.

(c) After a resolution adopted pursuant to subdivision (a) is duly recorded in the office of the county recorder and the signs required by subdivision (b) are posted, while the agreement entered into pursuant to subdivision (a) is in effect, the county shall not be liable for the death of, or injury to, any person or for damage to any real or personal property resulting from a dangerous condition of the highway or portion of the highway, as described in the resolution, caused by inadequate maintenance.



######### 960.  
Whenever the board of supervisors determines that any real property, or interest therein, acquired by the county for highway purposes is no longer necessary for those purposes, the county may sell or exchange the real property, or interest therein, in the manner and upon the terms and conditions approved by the board of supervisors. Any conveyance under this section shall be executed on behalf of the county by the chairman of the board of supervisors, and the money received for the real property shall be paid into the county treasury to the credit of any fund available for highway purposes, which the board of supervisors designates.



######### 960.5.  
The term “county highway” as used in Sections 954 and 954.5 shall be deemed to include, but not be limited to, any public highway, road, street, avenue, alley, lane, drive, way, place, court, or trail, or any purported county highway, public highway, road, street, avenue, alley, lane, drive, way, place, court, or trail.



######### 960.6.  
The board of supervisors may, by ordinance or resolution, delegate to a county official, subject to rules or regulations as the board may impose, the authority to lease any real property acquired by the county for highway purposes for a renewable term not exceeding three years. Proceeds from the lease of the property shall be paid into the county treasury to the credit of any fund designated by the board of supervisors which is available for highway purposes.

At least five working days prior to entering into a lease under this section, a notice of intention to enter into a lease shall be posted in a public place.



######### 964.  
Whenever the board finds that any county highway has been damaged or is in danger of being damaged by storm waters or floods, the board shall adopt all measures necessary to repair or prevent such damage. The board may condemn the right of way for, and may construct, flumes, ditches or canals for the purpose of carrying off such storm waters or floods.

The board may cause any expense incurred under this section to be paid out of the county general fund, or out of the funds of any road districts in which the highways are protected from damage or repaired by the work done.



######### 965.  
The board of supervisors shall, by order, direct the district attorney of the county to institute eminent domain proceedings, in the name of the county, whenever it is necessary to acquire real property or any interest therein to do any of the following things for the protection of a county highway:

(a) Raise the banks along any stream.

(b) Remove obstructions from any stream.

(c) Widen, change, deepen or straighten the channel of any stream.

(d) Construct flumes, ditches or canals, or make any improvements for the purpose of carrying off storm waters or floods.



######### 966.  
(a) The board of supervisors may provide for the erection and maintenance of gates on the county highways to avoid the necessity of building highway fences.  The board may prescribe rules and regulations for closing such gates, and penalties for violating such rules and regulations.

(b) The person, for whose immediate benefit the gates are erected or maintained, shall in all cases bear the expense of such erection and maintenance.



######### 967.  
Whenever a right of way for a highway is conveyed to a county and the sole consideration for the conveyance is an agreement by the county to construct and maintain a highway on the right of way and to construct highway fences on the right of way boundaries, and thereafter such right of way becomes a county highway, the board of supervisors may, within five years from the date of such conveyance, construct highway fences along the boundaries of such right of way.



######### 968.  
The board may cause the expense of constructing such fences to be charged to and paid from the county general fund, the road fund of the county or the district fund of each district benefited, but not more than one-half of the expense may be paid from the county general fund.



######### 969.  
Whenever a road is of general utility and of public convenience and constitutes the only or principal means of communication between one town or village and another town or village in the same county, the board of supervisors may determine, by a two-thirds vote of its membership, that the public convenience and necessity demand the acquisition and reconstruction of such road. Thereafter, by a resolution passed by a two-thirds vote of its membership, the board may determine to, and after such determination may proceed to, acquire and reconstruct such road although it is not of the width required by Section 906. The board shall charge the expense of such acquisition and reconstruction to the county general fund, the road fund of the county, or the district fund of each district benefited, or to any two or more of such funds in such proportions as the board considers just and equitable.



######### 969.5.  
Such boards may, after they have determined by a resolution adopted by a four-fifths vote of their membership that general county interest demands the improvement or repair of a privately owned road, improve or repair such road in consideration of the grant or lease of a right of way to the county for its own use or the use of the State, any political subdivision or other appropriate public agency for the public purposes specified in the resolution.

Such improvements or repairs shall be made and paid for in like manner as improvements or repairs of county highways.

By the same authorization the board may rent to the owner of land over which such a road has been open to the public for more than five years the machinery and equipment necessary to repair such road and the approaches thereto and any protecting embankments there may be, charging therefor by way of rental the cost of labor and other necessary expenses in addition to a reasonable allowance for depreciation of machinery.

Proceedings under this section shall not cause the road to become a county highway.



######### 969.6.  
Notwithstanding Section 969.5 or any other provision of this code, if a state of local emergency is declared by the board of supervisors as a result of locally heavy rainfall or flood, the board may authorize the expenditure of road funds for the purpose of emergency repairs to public roads which are not county highways and not in the county maintained system, without obtaining a grant or lease of right-of-way, if the repairs are necessary to provide minimum public access necessary for the protection or preservation of health or safety of residents. The county shall not be responsible for the maintenance of any road so repaired, and it shall not be liable for the condition of the road after the emergency repairs are made.



######### 970.5.  
Whenever the board of supervisors or a county officer designated by the board to be in charge of naming county highways finds that a name should be adopted and applied to any county highway, or that the existing name of any county highway should be changed, the board or the designated county officer shall hold a public hearing on the proposed name for, or the change of name of, such highway. Notice of such hearing shall be given by posting notice in at least three public places along the street or streets proposed to be affected, such posting to be complete at least 10 days before the day set for the hearing. At the time set for the hearing or at any time to which the hearing may be continued the board or the designated county officer shall hear and consider proposals to adopt a name for, or change the name of, the highway mentioned in the notice and objections to such proposals. At or after the conclusion of the hearing the board or the designated county officer may adopt a name for, or change the name of, such highway, and upon the adoption or change thereof shall make an order and file said order with the board of supervisors officially designating the name for such highway. Thereafter such highway shall be known by the name so designated.



######### 971.  
Any county highway which has not been officially named may be officially named by the board of supervisors or a county officer designated by the board without any hearing, or notice. Such naming shall be by an order duly made and filed with the board of supervisors. Thereafter the highway shall be known by the name thus designated.



######### 972.  
A board of supervisors may, by ordinance, permit the use of any county highway which connects with a main county highway of an adjoining county, by the board of supervisors of such adjoining county for the purpose of constructing and maintaining thereon a highway serving the needs of residents of both counties.



######### 973.  
The board of the county seeking the use, if it accepts the provisions of the ordinance adopted by the board of the county granting the use, may:

(a) Construct and maintain any such highway.

(b) Construct and maintain on such highway such bridges as it deems necessary. 

(c) Improve such highway in such manner as it determines.

(d) Acquire real property or interests therein adjacent to such highway in an adjoining county for county purposes, and expend thereon such amounts as the board deems necessary for county purposes.



######### 974.  
The expense of any work done or acquisition made pursuant to section 973 shall be paid by the county to which the use is granted out of the county general fund, or such other fund of the county as the board designates or makes available.



######### 975.  
The board of any county to which the use is granted, pursuant to the provisions of section 972, may, by mutual consent expressed through ordinances of the respective boards, retransfer the use, control, and maintenance of any highway, constructed under the provisions of sections 972 and 973, to the county originally granting the use.



######### 976.  
The board of supervisors of any county may purchase or lease with the consent of the owner, or may obtain by gift, and may hold, improve or maintain any real property or interest therein for the uses and purposes of county highways. Such real property or interest need not be within the boundaries of the county acquiring it, if it is convenient thereto in an adjoining county. In all such cases such property or interest is subject to the control of the county acquiring it and to the ordinances, rules, and regulations of such county.

Nothing in this section shall affect the power of any county to acquire property within its boundaries by proceedings in eminent domain in the manner prescribed by law.



######### 977.  
The board of supervisors of any county desiring to act under section 976 may, by unanimous vote of its membership, determine what real property is necessary and proper for the uses and purposes of county highways. Any county thus desiring to purchase or lease with the consent of the owner, or to obtain, hold, improve or maintain, real property or an interest therein situated within an adjoining county shall first obtain the consent by resolution of the board of supervisors of the adjoining county.



######### 978.  
Whenever the United States government grants real property to a county for highway uses and purposes, the county may take and dispose of such real property and the board of supervisors shall have, with regard to such real property, the powers of management, control and disposition provided by law for other county property.



######### 979.  
The board of supervisors shall keep in repair all objects or markers adjacent to a county highway which have been erected to mark registered historical places and shall keep such markers free from all vegetation which may obscure them from view.



######### 982.  
Except as provided in this section, the board of supervisors shall have power to temporarily close all or any part of any public highway, road, street, avenue, alley, lane or place and grant the possession and use thereof, together with the management and control thereof, to any person, firm or corporation operating, managing and controlling any exposition or fair in aid of which the granting of public moneys or other things of value has been authorized by the Constitution or laws of this State upon such terms and conditions, and for such periods of time, as the board of supervisors may determine, such possession, use, management and control to terminate not later than one year after the closing of such exposition or fair. As to State highways, the exercise of any power granted hereby shall be subject to the approval of the department.



######### 985.  
The board of supervisors may construct, install and maintain cattle guards on or adjacent to the county highways. The cost of constructing, installing, and maintaining such cattle guards may be paid from the general county fund.

The board of supervisors may, under such restrictions, plans and specifications as it may deem proper, permit any property owner to construct, install or maintain at his own expense, cattle guards on or adjacent to any county highway.  The construction and maintenance of such cattle guards shall be under the direction and supervision of the board of supervisors, and they may require such bond as they deem proper as a condition of the granting of permission to erect such cattle guard.



######### 989.  
(a) (1) Upon the incorporation of a city or upon the annexation of territory to a city, all right, title, and interest of the county, including the underlying fee where owned by the county, in and to any county highway within the territory involved, which had been accepted into the county road system pursuant to Section 941 shall vest in the city and shall thereupon constitute a city street.  

(2) All right, title, and interest of a county in and to any county highway included within territory heretofore incorporated as a city or annexed to a city is hereby determined to have vested in the city as a city street.  

(b) Subdivision (a) does not apply to a road or highway which had been accepted into the county road system pursuant to Section 941 after the date of the first signature on a petition for annexation or incorporation, the adoption of a resolution of application by an affected local agency, or a date mutually agreed upon by the city and county.  

(c) Nothing in subdivision (a) requires a city to improve the affected road or highway to city standards.



######### 990.  
Where practical or desirable, the board of supervisors shall, along any highway under its jurisdiction, possession, or control, replace trees that have been destroyed or removed because of projects undertaken to widen the highway.

Money received by county from the Highway Users Tax Fund available for the widening of highways is also available for the planting of trees pursuant to this section.



######### 991.  
Before any bridge on a county highway is constructed over any navigable river, the board of supervisors, after a study and public hearing on the question, shall determine and shall prepare a report on the feasibility of providing public access to the river for recreational purposes and a determination as to whether such public access shall be provided.







##### CHAPTER 3. Road Districts [1020 - 1029]  

######### 1020.  
The boards of supervisors may divide their respective counties into suitable road districts, may change the boundaries thereof, and may create new districts. The board shall not include in such road district any city wherein street work and improvements are done by virtue of any law relating to street work and improvements within such city.



######### 1026.  
Whenever the board of supervisors finds that any road district in such county is or will be unreasonably burdened by the expense of constructing or maintaining any county highway, or any bridge or tunnel connecting or forming a part of such highway, or by the expense of the purchase of any toll roads the board may:

(a) Order the whole or any portion of the aggregate expense to be paid out of the road fund of the county.

######### 1027.  
When the alteration of an old or the opening of a new county highway necessitates the removal of fences on real property acquired for highway purposes, the road commissioner shall serve upon the owner, his occupant or his agent, a notice to remove the fences, or in lieu of such service may post such notice on the fences which are to be removed.

If, within ten days after such service or posting, the removal is not completed, or is not commenced and then being prosecuted with due diligence, the road commissioner may cause the fence to be carefully removed at the expense of the owner, and may recover judgment of him for the cost of such removal.  The road commissioner may sell the fence material and apply the proceeds toward the satisfaction of the judgment.



######### 1028.  
The board of supervisors may call, at such times as in the judgment of the board may be required, a special meeting of the board for hearing highway and road matters. At such special meetings the board shall hear highway and bridge reports and complaints from officers and citizens, and shall take such action regarding the reports and complaints as the public welfare demands.



######### 1029.  
The consolidation of road districts as provided in Section 2006 shall be without prejudice to the legal requirement that all road district taxes collected in any one such district shall be expended in that district.







##### CHAPTER 3.5. Private Byroads [1050 - 1054]  

######### 1050.  
For the purposes of this chapter, “private byroads” are roads opened, laid out, or altered for the purpose of providing access to parcels of contiguous private land of more than 100 acres which have been cut off by a change in the course of a navigable stream. Except as provided in this chapter, private byroads may be opened, laid out, or altered for the necessity of one or more residents or landowners of any road district in the same manner, and using the same procedure, as specified for the opening, laying out, or altering of public roads as provided in Article 3 (commencing with Section 1160) of Chapter 4; provided, however, that only one petitioner is necessary.



######### 1051.  
The petitioner shall be a landowner in the road district.



######### 1052.  
The petitioner shall accompany the petition with a bond, approved by the board of supervisors, in double the amount of the probable cost of the proceedings, including the market value for land taken and any severance damage resulting from the taking, and shall be conditioned that the petitioner will pay all costs of the proceedings, including any compensation which may be awarded to any landowner. The bond shall be further conditioned that the petitioner will pay to the person over whose land the private byroad is sought to be opened or altered, the necessary costs and disbursements in contesting the opening or alteration of the private byroad, in case the petition is not granted or the private byroad is finally not opened or altered.



######### 1053.  
The board of supervisors may, by resolution, order the private byroad to be opened, laid out, or altered. The clerk shall cause such order to be recorded in the office of the county recorder within five days, naming the owner of the dominant tenement as “grantee” and the owner of the servient tenement as “grantor.”



######### 1054.  
The person for whose benefit the private byroad is required shall pay the landowner the market value for land taken and any severance damage resulting from such taking and shall build and maintain the private byroad.






#### CHAPTER 4. Methods of Performing Highway Work [1070 - 1197]  


##### ARTICLE 1. By Boards of Supervisors [1070- 1070.]  

######### 1070.  
Whenever a board of supervisors, by a four-fifths vote of its membership, determines that the public convenience and necessity demand the acquisition or construction of a new county highway or the improvement, repair or maintenance of any existing county highway, and that the expense of such new highway or the expense of improving, repairing or maintaining such existing highway is too great to pay out of the road fund of the district, the board may, by a resolution passed by a four-fifths vote of its membership, determine to make such acquisition or do such work, and charge the expense thereof to the county general fund, the road fund of the county or the district fund of any district benefited.








##### ARTICLE 3. By Permanent Road Divisions [1160 - 1197]  

######### 1160.  
As used in this article:

(a) “Division” means permanent road division.

(b) “Last equalized assessment roll” means the last assessment roll made up by the county assessor, including the changes ordered by the board of supervisors sitting as a board of equalization.

(c) “Highway” means any county road or highway or any public roadway right of way or any private easement or roadway not accepted or acceptable into the county highway system but upon which a permanent public easement is offered or any privately owned road which meets the requirements of and in connection with which the necessary findings of Section 969.5 of this code can be made.



######### 1160.5.  
This article shall be known and may be cited as the Permanent Road Division Law.



######### 1161.  
Any portion of a county, not already contained in a division, may be formed into a division under the provisions of this article. When formed, each division shall have the powers enumerated in this article. For the purpose of this article, a city is not a division, but may be included in a division.



######### 1162.  
A petition for the formation of a division may be presented to the board of supervisors of the county wherein the division is proposed to be formed. The petition shall contain:

(a) The name of the proposed division.

(b) The signatures of at least a majority of the landowners within the proposed division or the signatures of owners of more than 50 percent of the assessed valuation within the division.

(c) The boundaries of the proposed division.

(d) The number of acres therein and the assessed valuation of such acreage according to the last equalized assessment roll of the county.

(e) The value of the improvements on real estate and of the personal property within the proposed division according to the last equalized assessment roll.

(f) The number of inhabitants therein, as nearly as can be ascertained.

(g) A particular description of the location of any highway which it is desired to construct, improve or permanently maintain or maintain for a specified number of years, in the event of which such limited period of maintenance the period thereof shall be shown and a statement showing the necessity for such work.



######### 1162.5.  
(a) In lieu of submission of a petition pursuant to Section 1162, formation of a division may be initiated by a resolution of the board of supervisors.  The resolution shall meet all the requirements of Section 1162 except those relating to signatures of landowners.  In addition, the resolution shall fix a time and place for a public hearing on the establishment of the proposed division which shall not be less than 30 nor more than 60 days after the adoption of the resolution.

(b) The clerk of the board of supervisors shall publish a notice of the hearing pursuant to Section 6061 of the Government Code in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county, or, if there is no newspaper published in the county, in a newspaper of general circulation which is circulated in the territory proposed to be included within the division. Publication shall be complete at least seven days prior to the date of the hearing.  The notice shall contain the text of the resolution, the time and place for the hearing, and a statement that at the hearing the testimony of all interested persons for or against the establishment of the division will be heard.

At least 20 days before the date set for the hearing, the clerk of the board of supervisors shall mail copies of the notice to all affected landowners whose names appear on the last equalized assessment roll.

(c) At the hearing, protests against the establishment of the division may be made orally or in writing by any interested person.  Any protests pertaining to the regularity or sufficiency of the proceedings shall be in writing and clearly set forth the irregularities and defects to which objection is made.  All written protests shall be filed with the clerk of the board of supervisors on or before the time fixed for the hearing and may be withdrawn in writing at any time before the conclusion of the hearing.  The board may waive any irregularities in the form or content of any written protest and at the hearing may correct minor defects in the proceedings.

(d) If written protests are received from at least 25 percent but not more than 50 percent of the affected landowners, or landowners who would be required to pay any proposed special tax or parcel charge which represents more than 25 percent of the total amount of the expected revenue necessary to finance the division, and those protests are not withdrawn by the end of the hearing, the proposed division shall be submitted to the landowners for majority voter approval.

If written protests are received from 50 percent or more of the affected landowners, or landowners who would be required to pay any proposed special tax or parcel charge which represents more than 50 percent of the total amount of the expected revenue necessary to finance the division and those protests are not withdrawn by the end of the hearing, the proposed division shall be abandonded for at least one year.

(e) The board of supervisors may conduct, by mail, any election held to approve or disapprove a proposed division.

(f) If no election is required pursuant to subdivision (d), the division may be formed pursuant to Section 1166.

(g) If an election is required pursuant to subdivision (d), the board of supervisors may include on the same ballot the question of whether a special tax shall be levied within the division.  The board of supervisors may submit the question of levy of a special tax to the voters separately from the question of formation of the division, or may consolidate both questions into a single measure.  Sections 1173 to 1178, inclusive, are applicable to an election held pursuant to this subdivision.



######### 1162.6.  
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the board of supervisors may form a permanent road division without reference to a specific permanent road project.  The division may include the entire unincorporated area of the county.  The board may create zones within the division for specific permanent road projects, with differing special taxes or parcel charges. Parcel charges shall be deemed to be assessments within the meaning of Article XIII D of the California Constitution.

(b) Formation of the division shall be initiated by resolution of the board of supervisors that sets a time and date for a hearing on the matter. Notice of the hearing shall be given pursuant to Section 6061 of the Government Code in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county, or, if there is no newspaper of general circulation published in the county, in a newspaper of general circulation that is circulated within the territory proposed to be included within the division.  Publication shall be complete at least seven days prior to the hearing.

(c) At the hearing, the board of supervisors shall hear all objections to the establishment of the division and shall determine whether to form the division.

(d) Proceedings to form a division or zones may be consolidated with an assessment ballot proceeding pursuant to Section 53753 of the Government Code.



######### 1163.  
Such petition shall be accompanied by an affidavit stating that affiant has compared the valuations given in the petition with those on the last equalized assessment roll and that such valuations are complete and correct. The affiant shall be a person over the age of eighteen who is not a signatory to the petition and who owns no taxable property in the division.



######### 1164.  
Such petition shall be published in the manner authorized by Section 1196, together with a notice stating the time of the meeting at which the board will consider the petition.



######### 1165.  
Such petition shall be presented either at a regular meeting of the board or at a special meeting called to receive and consider it. On the day stated in the notice the board shall hear the petition and may adjourn such hearing from time to time, but not longer than one month in all.



######### 1166.  
Following the hearing or election, as the case may be, the board shall decide if the proposed division is to be formed. If the board decides to form the division, it may make changes in the boundaries as it finds proper and shall define and establish the boundaries. The changes shall not include any territory outside of the boundaries described in the petition or resolution unless the board has given at least 15 days’ notice of its intention to include that territory in the division. The notice shall be given by publication, in the the manner authorized by Section 1196, and by leaving a copy of the notice at each place of abode in the outside territory.



######### 1167.  
The boundaries established by the board shall be the boundaries of the division until such boundaries are changed in the manner provided in this article.



######### 1168.  
If the board finds that the boundaries thus established for such division are incorrectly described, it shall direct the county surveyor to ascertain and report a correct description of the boundaries in conformity with the orders of the board. At the first regular meeting of the board after the filing of the county surveyor’s report, the board shall cause to be published, in the manner authorized by section 1196, a notice that the report will be considered at the next regular meeting of the board, stating the day. At the appointed meeting the board shall ratify the report of the surveyor, with such modifications as the board considers necessary. The boundaries established pursuant to this section shall be the legal boundaries of the division.



######### 1168.5.  
Any landowner whose property is located within the division may file a verified petition with the board alleging that the property will not be benefited by any construction, improvement, or maintenance project proposed to be undertaken by the division.

In such case, the board shall set the petition for hearing.  Notice of the hearing shall be published in accordance with Section 1196.  If, after hearing all of the evidence introduced at such hearing, the board finds and determines that the property will not, in fact, be benefited by the proposed project to be undertaken by the division and if there are no outstanding obligations owed by the landowner to the division, the board may order the property withdrawn and the boundaries modified accordingly.  Thereafter, the boundaries as modified shall be the legal boundaries of the division.



######### 1168.7.  
The board may hold a hearing to determine if any property located outside of a division will benefit from any construction, improvement, or maintenance project proposed to be undertaken by the division.

Notice of the hearing shall be published in accordance with Section 1196. Notice shall also be mailed by the board, at least 10 days prior to the hearing, to all landowners whose property located outside of the division may benefit from the proposed project.  The failure to mail any notice, or the failure of any person to receive such notice, shall not affect the validity of any action taken by the board under this section.

If, after hearing all of the evidence introduced at the hearing, the board finds and determines that property located outside of the division will benefit from the project proposed to be undertaken by the division, the board may order the boundaries of the division to be modified so as to include such property.  Thereafter, the boundaries as modified shall be the legal boundaries of the division.



######### 1168.8.  
(a) Property may be annexed to or detached from a permanent road division in the same manner and under the same procedures provided in Sections 1162 to 1168, inclusive, for the formation of a division.  Any reference to “proposed division” in any of these sections shall be deemed to be a reference to the area proposed for annexation to or detachment from the existing division.

(b) If the board finds that the proposed annexation or detachment should occur, with or without modification, the board may by resolution declare the change to be made and establish a date upon which the boundaries of the division, as amended, shall become effective.

(c) Property annexed to a division in which bonds are outstanding for work performed pursuant to this article shall not be deemed to be property in the division for the purpose of Section 1184.

(d) Property detached from a division in which bonds are outstanding for work done pursuant to this article shall be deemed to be property in the division for purposes of Section 1184 until the bonds are retired.

(e) This section is alternative to any other provision of this article providing for a change in boundaries of a permanent road division.



######### 1168.9.  
(a) The board may order two or more divisions consolidated if the board finds that their boundaries are contiguous at any point or that a consolidated program of construction, improvement, or maintenance will reduce the costs of or increase the efficiency of providing highway construction, improvement, or maintenance.

(b) Property within a division proposed to be consolidated with another division and in which bonds are not outstanding for work performed pursuant to this article shall not be deemed to be property in the division for the purpose of Section 1184 as it applies to the consolidated division.



######### 1169.  
At, or at any time after, the time of forming a division, any 10 or more freeholders thereof may petition the board to have plans prepared for the construction, improvement, or maintenance of all or any part of any highway lying within the division, whether or not such highway is mentioned in the petition for the formation of the division. In the event that there are 10 or fewer freeholders thereof, such petition will be sufficient if it bears the signatures of at least a majority of the landowners within the proposed division and the signatures of owners of more than 50 percent of the assessed valuation within the division.



######### 1170.  
Such petition for construction or improvement shall state if appropriate:

(a) The recommendations of the petitioners as to the materials to be used and the manner of constructing or improving such highway.

(b) An estimate of the probable expense of such work.

(c) A request that the board appropriate for such work a specified sum of money from the road fund of the county.

(d) A request that the board appropriate for such work a specified sum of money from the road district funds of the road districts in which any part of the division is located.

(e) A request that, in order to raise the balance necessary for such work, a special tax be levied or bonds of the division be issued.

(f) A request that annually for the period for which maintenance is proposed the board levy a special tax upon the division in amount sufficient for maintenance and annually appropriate such amount for maintenance purposes.



######### 1171.  
Upon receiving such petition the board shall cause to be prepared estimates, plans, and specifications for the work mentioned in the petition exclusive of maintenance, and for any other highway or work which the board considers a necessary part of the highway mentioned in the petition.



######### 1172.  
When it has adopted plans and specifications for such work exclusive of maintenance, the board may set apart therefor from the road fund of the county, and from the funds of any district of which the division is a part, such sums as the board considers equitable.

The board shall not set apart from the funds of any such district less than 75 percent of the sum which bears the same ratio to the whole fund of the particular district as the assessed valuation of that part of the division lying in the district bears to the whole assessed valuation of the district. The board may set apart more than this percentage.  The board shall cause the sums to be set apart in a fund known as the “permanent road fund of ____ division,” specifying the division by name.



######### 1173.  
When a special tax is petitioned for, the board shall immediately order an election within the division to determine whether such tax will be levied. The board may submit to the electors at such election the question whether the balance of the estimated cost of the proposed work will be raised by a special tax in one year or spread equally over 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 successive years and whether the amount annually estimated to be needed for maintenance will be raised by the annual levy of a special tax for the period appropriate to the period indicated in the petition. The electorate at such an election shall consist of the registered voters residing within the boundaries of the division if there are 10 or more registered voters residing within the division at the time of ordering the election or if there are less than 10 registered voters within the boundaries of the division at the time of ordering the election the electorate shall consist of the legal owners of the land lying within the boundaries of such division as shown on the last equalized assessment roll unless proof of transfer of legal title satisfactory to the board is submitted to the board at least 10 days prior to the date of election in which event the transferee shall be an elector in the place and stead of the transferor unless the transferor is the legal owner of other property within the boundaries of the division.



######### 1174.  
The board shall call such election by posting notices in the manner provided in section 1195, and by publishing notice of the election in the manner authorized by section 1196.



######### 1175.  
Such notice of election shall contain:

(a) The time and place of holding the election.

(b) The amount of money proposed to be raised for construction or improvement. 

(c) The purpose for which such money is to be used, including a brief description of the proposed work and materials to be used.

(d) Whether it is proposed to raise the amount in one or more years, stating the number of years and the amount to be raised each year.

(e) Whether it is proposed to levy a tax annually for maintenance and for what period any such tax is proposed.



######### 1176.  
For the purposes of this election, the board shall establish, by order, one or more precincts and appoint three judges for each precinct to conduct the election. The election shall be conducted as nearly as practicable in conformity with the general election laws, but no particular form of ballot need be used. The ballots shall contain the words “Tax—Yes” and “Tax—No”.  No informality in conducting the election shall invalidate the election if it was otherwise fairly conducted.



######### 1177.  
The officers of the election shall certify the result of the election to the board, giving the whole number of votes cast, and the number for and the number against the tax. If the majority is against the tax, the money transferred to the fund of such division shall revert to the funds from which it was taken.



######### 1178.  
If two-thirds of the votes cast are for the tax, the board shall annually, at the time of levying the county taxes, levy a special tax in the division sufficient to raise the amount voted for the current fiscal year, sufficient to meet estimated costs of maintenance for the current fiscal year, and sufficient to reimburse the county for any expenses recoverable under Section 1197.



######### 1178.5.  
When the levy of a special tax has been authorized, the board of supervisors may advance to the permanent road division the division’s share of the cost of the improvements or the board of supervisors may determine to proceed with such work at such time as the estimated expense has been raised by taxes levied within the division.



######### 1179.  
The tax so levied shall be collected in the same manner as county taxes and, when collected, shall be paid into the county treasury for the use of the division in which the tax is collected.



######### 1179.5.  
In lieu of, or in addition to, any special tax levied pursuant to Section 1178, the board may fix and collect parcel charges for any permanent road division pursuant to the assessment ballot procedures in Section 53753 of the Government Code.



######### 1179.6.  
(a) In addition to any other authority granted under this article, the board may issue bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness on behalf of a permanent road division or a zone to finance capital improvements for a term of not more than 10 years, to be repaid solely from special taxes or parcel charges levied within the division or zone.

(b) The provisions of Sections 53356.1 to 53356.6, inclusive, of the Government Code shall apply within the division or zone with regard to the collection of the special taxes or parcel charges and to the foreclosure of liens when the board has issued bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness on behalf of the division or zone.



######### 1180.  
If the petition proposing the work asks for the issuance of bonds of the division, the board shall call an election in such division and submit to the electors thereof the question whether the bonds of the division shall be issued. The board shall call such election by posting notices in the manner provided in section 1195 and by publishing notice thereof in the manner provided in section 1196.



######### 1181.

(g) The signature of the chair of the board, attested by the clerk of the board of supervisors.



######### 1182.  
The election shall be conducted as nearly as practicable in accordance with the general election laws, but no particular form of ballot need be used. No informality in conducting the election shall invalidate the election if it was otherwise fairly conducted. At such elections the ballots shall contain the words “Bond—Yes” and “Bond—No.”



######### 1183.  
The officers of the election shall certify the result of the election to the board, giving the whole number of votes cast and the number for and the number against the bonds. If two-thirds of those voting on the proposition are in favor of issuing the bonds, the board shall cause an entry of that fact to be made upon the minutes of the board.



######### 1184.  
The board may then issue the bonds of the division to the number and amount provided for in the election proceedings. The bonds shall be payable out of the funds of the division, and the money for the redemption of and the interest on the bonds shall be raised by taxation upon the property in the division. The total amount of bonds so issued shall not exceed fifteen per cent of the taxable property of the division as shown by the last equalized assessment roll of the county.

######### 1186.  
The interest on the bonds shall be payable annually.  Each bond and each coupon shall bear the signature or facsimile printed signature of the chair of the board and of the clerk of the board of supervisors.  The county treasurer shall, after reasonable notice, sell the bonds to the highest and best bidder, but not for less than par plus any accrued interest.



######### 1187.  
If, at the election on the question of whether or not bonds are to be issued, the bonds are not authorized, the money transferred to the fund of the division shall revert to the funds from which it was taken.



######### 1188.  
The board shall cause the highway work provided for in this article to be done in accordance with the provisions of Sections 20391 to 20395, inclusive, of the Public Contract Code, except that the notice calling for bids shall be published in a newspaper published in the division if there is such a newspaper. The successful bidder shall deposit a bond in the amount the board requires, conditioned on the faithful performance of the contract and on the payment for all labor employed and all material used in the work.



######### 1189.  
Before opening the bids for doing any work provided for in this article, the board may appoint such inspectors as it considers necessary and fix their compensation, or may proceed as provided in either section 1075 or section 1191. Such compensation shall be paid out of the funds of the division. Such inspectors shall:

(a) Inspect from time to time the work being done under the contract.

(b) File with the board at least once a month reports on the manner in which the contractor is performing the work, setting forth in detail any objections they or any of them have to the manner in which the work is being done, with recommendations as to changes desirable and provided for in the plans and specifications.

######### 1190.  
The board shall make no payment on account of work which is reported by the inspectors to be unsatisfactory, until the objections are investigated and determined to be unfounded, or until the contractor has performed the work in strict compliance with the plans and specifications.



######### 1191.  
In lieu of the appointment of inspectors as provided in section 1189, or in lieu of proceeding pursuant to section 1075, the board may employ an engineer who shall prepare plans and specifications, supervise the work, and perform such other services as the board requires.

From time to time as the work progresses, the board may make payments on account, but shall not, before the completion of the contract, pay more than seventy-five per cent of the contract price of the amount completed. The board shall not make final payment until the work is accepted by the board.

Any money in the fund of the division, after completion of, and final payment for, the work contracted for, shall remain in such fund and be expended solely in maintaining the highways of that division.



######### 1194.  
On payment of all debts of the division or on the failure of the division within two years after formation to vote a special tax or bonds for any proposed work, the division shall cease to exist, unless the division also exists for the purpose of maintenance.



######### 1194.5.  
A permanent road division formed for the purpose of maintenance that has ceased to exist as a result of the amendments made to Section 1194 by Section 3 of Chapter 1025 of the Statutes of 1969 may be reinstated as an active and functioning division upon order of the board of supervisors adopted by resolution, if the board finds that the necessity for maintenance work within the division continues to exist and any limited period of maintenance set forth in the petition for the formation of the division has not expired.



######### 1195.  
The board shall cause the notices, which are required to be posted by sections 1174 and 1180, to be posted at least fifteen days before the election along every highway proposed to be constructed or improved, at distances not more than one mile apart, and not less than three such notices.



######### 1196.  
The board shall cause all publications, required by this article, particularly sections 1164, 1166, 1168, 1174 and 1180, in any proceeding or election, to be published in a newspaper published within the division, if any newspaper is published therein. If there is no newspaper published within the division, the board shall cause such publication to be made in a newspaper published within the county and considered by the board best adapted to give notice to the residents of the division. One publication each week for three successive weeks shall be a sufficient publication under this article, the last publication to be not less than seven days prior to the event of which the publication is notice.



######### 1197.  
The expenses of organizing a division, conducting any necessary election, and providing engineering services, pursuant to this article, shall be a county charge payable out of the county general fund.

Whenever any county has appointed a road commissioner for all road districts in the county as authorized by Section 2006, or whenever any county has adopted a county charter pursuant to Section 4 of Article XI of the California Constitution, providing for the appointment of a road commissioner as a county officer, and for the organization of a permanent road department for the construction, improvement, and maintenance of highways and bridges, the road commissioner has charge of the construction and maintenance of all county bridges in the county, under the order and direction of the board of supervisors as provided in Section 1332.








##### ARTICLE 3. Joint Bridges [1390 - 1404]  

######### 1390.  
Any bridge crossing the line between a city and a road district may be constructed and maintained, as provided in section 1391, by the city and by the county from the road fund of the district into which such bridge extends.

Any bridge crossing the line between cities may be constructed and maintained by such cities as provided in section 1391.



######### 1391.  
Any bridge referred to in section 1390 may be constructed by contract, let as provided by law, by any city into which the bridge extends, or by the county into which such bridge extends or in which such bridge is located. Any such city or county may contribute toward the expense of the construction or maintenance of such bridge by the appropriation for such purpose of any money in its treasury not otherwise appropriated, upon such terms and conditions as are prescribed by ordinance or resolution of the governing body of such city.



######### 1392.  
If the proportion to be paid by any such city or county can not be otherwise determined, the expense of construction or maintenance of any such bridge shall be borne equally by the city and from the road fund of the road district into both of which the bridge reaches, or by the cities into which the bridge reaches.



######### 1393.  
The proceeds of any bonds authorized by the voters of any such city or county for the acquisition, construction or completion of any such bridge, or any portion thereof, may be expended or contributed as provided in sections 1391 and 1392.

(a) Any county may join with any city located within such county in the acquisition, construction or maintenance of any bridge or viaduct within the county, whether such bridge or viaduct is or is to be located within or without any such city.

(b) The expense of the acquisition, construction or maintenance of any such bridge or viaduct shall be borne by such county and such city in such proportion as the legislative bodies thereof determine by resolution or ordinance and may be paid out of any funds available for such purpose.

(c) The authority and responsibility for the acquisition, construction or maintenance of any such bridge or viaduct shall vest in the county or in the city, or in both, as provided in the ordinances or resolutions apportioning the expense.



######### 1395.  
Any bridge which crosses the line between counties, unless otherwise specially provided for, shall be constructed by the counties into which such bridge reaches. Each of the counties into which any such bridge reaches shall pay that portion of the expense of the bridge previously agreed upon by the boards of supervisors of such counties, even though such bridge reaches within the limits of a city.



######### 1396.  
The boards of supervisors in their respective counties may erect free county bridges on county highways across navigable bodies of water in this State.



######### 1397.  
If a navigable body of water is the boundary line between counties, the boards of such counties may join in the construction of a free county bridge upon the terms to which they agree. In the event of a failure to agree, either county may build a bridge and retain control thereof.



######### 1398.  
The board of supervisors of any county may declare that it is necessary for the public convenience to construct a bridge across any body of water or swampland which lies in or extends into the county, and may prescribe the points between which such bridge will be built. Thereafter the board may let any contract to build the bridge, and pay for any such work out of the county general fund.



######### 1399.  
The boards of supervisors of two adjoining counties may enter into an agreement with any person with whom such boards desire to collaborate for the purposes specified in section 1400, if such boards find that any of the following circumstances exist:

(a) That any bridge is necessary for highway purposes over any navigable body of water lying between such counties.

(b) That any existing bridge over any navigable body of water lying between such counties, and used wholly or in part for highway purposes, whether owned by either county or both counties, or used by either or both by agreement with the owner of the bridge, requires, in the interest of commerce or because of lack of repair:

(1) Reconstruction.

(2) Replacement by a new structure.

(3) Relocation at a place on such navigable body of water better suited to the use of the bridge or to the use of such navigable water.



######### 1400.  
The agreement authorized by section 1399 may provide for any of the following:

(a) The construction of a bridge.

(b) The reconstruction of the existing bridge or its replacement by a new structure.

(c) The rebuilding of the bridge at another location.

(d) The joint use of the resulting bridge thereafter by such person and the public.

(e) The apportionment of the expense of any bridge work between each of the counties and such person jointly using or to use the bridge.  In no event shall either county agree to contribute more than one-third of the expense of construction, reconstruction, relocation, replacement or repair of any such bridge.

(f) The construction and use of the bridge in the manner and upon the terms and conditions agreed upon between such counties and such person.



######### 1401.  
Any work done pursuant to such an agreement is exempt from any provisions of law regarding the letting of contracts by counties for the performance of any work upon bridges.

The board of supervisors of any county now controlling or maintaining, by virtue of any statute, any bridge across any navigable stream, which bridge is wholly or in part within any city, may whenever necessary:

(a) Reconstruct all or any part of such bridge.

(b) Replace such bridge by a new structure.

(c) With the consent of the governing body of such city, change the location of such bridge to a location on the stream better suited to the use of the bridge or to the use of the navigable stream.  The board of supervisors may abandon any such existing bridge and build a new bridge at such changed location.



######### 1403.  
The board of supervisors reconstructing, replacing or relocating such bridge may enter into an agreement with any person who is then maintaining any bridge across any such navigable stream, for the building of a joint bridge in order to prevent the impeding of commerce on such navigable stream, and to apportion the expense between the county and the person in any manner mutually agreed upon.



######### 1404.  
The expense of such reconstruction, or of the building of a new bridge is payable from the same fund provided by law for the maintenance and repair of any such bridge. If the county makes such an agreement with any person for the building of a joint bridge, the county shall pay from such fund only its portion of the cost of the joint bridge, as settled by the agreement. In no event may the county pay more than one-half the expense of construction, repair or reconstruction of any such joint bridge.








##### ARTICLE 4. Subways [1430 - 1436]  

######### 1430.  
For the purposes of this article, “subway” includes tube or tunnel.



######### 1431.  
Whenever in the interests of commerce, for the benefit of the residents of the county, or for the purpose of expediting travel between points on opposite sides of any navigable body of water, the board of supervisors of any county finds it advisable to construct for the public use any subway under any such navigable body of water, at a location determined upon by the board, the board shall call an election and submit to the electors of the county the question whether bonds of the county will be issued and sold for the purpose of constructing such a subway.



######### 1432.  
The order calling such an election shall be valid and effectual when signed by two-thirds of the members of the board. The election shall be held and the bonds issued in accordance with the provisions of law governing county bond elections and the issuance of county bonds.



######### 1433.  
The board of supervisors of any county may, for the purpose of ascertaining the probable expense of any proposed subway, expend out of the county general fund a sum not exceeding thirty-five hundred dollars. When any such proposed subway reaches partly into one county and partly into another, such counties shall equally divide the expenditure necessary to ascertain the probable expense of any such proposed subway, but such expenditure shall not exceed in the aggregate the sum of thirty-five hundred dollars.



######### 1434.  
Whenever any such subway is proposed to be constructed under any navigable body of water forming the dividing line between counties, the boards of supervisors of each of the counties into which any such subway will reach shall first agree as to what portions of the expense of such subway will be paid by each county. Thereafter the board of each county may take the proceedings it considers proper under the provisions of this article.



######### 1435.  
Such a subway shall not be constructed under any navigable body of water forming the dividing line between counties, unless all the counties into which such subway reaches first authorize such work and also authorize the issue of bonds therefor in the manner provided in this article.



######### 1436.  
Whenever any such proposed subway will reach within the limits of any city, if the governing body of each such city and the board of supervisors of the county in which each such city is situated first so agree, the board of supervisors may call an election and submit to the electors of the county, in the manner provided in this article, the question whether bonds of the county will be issued and sold for the purpose of constructing such a subway in the manner prescribed in this article.

Any permit issued under the provisions of this chapter may provide that the permittee will pay the entire expense of replacing the highway in as good condition as before, and may provide such other conditions as to the location and the manner in which the work is to be done as the road commissioner finds necessary for the protection of the highway.



######### 1463.  
Any permit issued to a public agency or a public utility having lawful authority to occupy the highways shall contain a provision that in the event the future improvement of the highway necessitates the relocation of such encroachment the permittee will relocate the same at his sole expense. In said event the road commissioner shall serve on the permittee his written demand specifying the place of relocation, and specifying a reasonable time within which the work of relocation must be commenced. The permittee must commence such relocation within the time specified in said demand and thereafter diligently prosecute the same to completion.

All permits other than those issued to public agencies or a public utility having lawful authority to occupy the highways are revocable on five days’ notice and the encroachment must be removed or relocated as may be specified by the road commissioner in the notice revoking the permit and within a reasonable time specified by the road commissioner unless the permit provides a specified time.

The road commissioner may, but is not required to, supervise any work done under any permit issued under the provisions of this chapter, in which event the permittee shall pay the reasonable cost of such supervision to the road commissioner, but no cost of supervision shall be charged by the road commissioner to any public corporation, provided, however, this section shall not operate to prevent charges made pursuant to Government Code Section 6103.6.



######### 1465.  
(a) Permittees may excavate openings in county highways to make repairs in cases of emergency requiring immediate action.  In such cases the appropriate representative of the road commissioner shall be promptly notified of any such action, and such permittee, at his own expense, shall immediately replace such county highway in as good condition as before such excavation.

(b) A public agency supplying water service to its inhabitants may, within its corporate limits, excavate a county highway without a permit in cases of emergency requiring immediate action; but in such cases the county highway shall, at the expense of the public agency, be replaced in as good condition as before such excavation.



######### 1466.  
The road commissioner may delegate to any city any of the road commissioner’s powers, duties, and authority, other than those of approval, under this chapter as to any county highway, or any part thereof, within such city, and may withdraw any such delegation of authority.



######### 1467.  
The road commissioner may require the applicant to file with the road commissioner a satisfactory bond payable to the people of the county in such amount as the road commissioner deems sufficient, conditioned on the proper compliance by the permittee with the provisions of this chapter.



######### 1468.  
Except as otherwise provided in this section, such a bond shall not be required of any public agency or public utility having lawful authority to occupy the highways which is authorized by law to establish or maintain any works or facilities in, under or over any public highway, nor shall the application of any such public agency or public utility for a permit be denied.

The road commissioner may require of any such applicant a bond in a sum not to exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), if such applicant has in fact prior to such application failed to comply with the provisions of this chapter or with the provisions of a previous permit.



######### 1469.  
Any city, municipal utility district, municipal water district, public utility having lawful authority to occupy the highways or metropolitan water district is entitled to a blanket permit issued by the road commissioner, renewable annually, for the installation of its service connections and for ordinary maintenance of its facilities located or installed in county highways; but the road commissioner may revoke any such blanket permit if the permittee fails to comply with the provisions of this article.

######### 1550.1.  
The board of supervisors may form special road maintenance districts in unincorporated areas of the county wholly outside of incorporated cities. Formation of these districts may be ordered by the board when in its opinion additional road funds are necessary to properly maintain highways and roads in specific unincorporated areas of the county. These districts shall be formed by order of the board setting forth the boundaries thereof. A district shall be in existence until the board shall by its order discontinue the district. If a district is to be formed, the board shall set a date for a hearing on the formation. This hearing shall not be held in less than three weeks after the date of the order for the hearing, and prior to the date of the hearing, a notice of the hearing shall be published twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the area, and, in addition, at least three notices shall be posted in public places within the proposed district.

##### ARTICLE 3. Other Highway Funds [1622 - 1630]  

######### 1622.  
All amounts paid to each county, out of money derived from the Highway Users Tax Fund shall be deposited in a “road fund” which each board of supervisors shall establish for that purpose.

Interest received by a county from the investment of money in its road fund shall be deposited in the fund and shall be used for road purposes.



######### 1623.  
The board of supervisors of any county may expend any portion of the amounts thus received by that county in the construction, maintenance, improvement or repair of streets, bridges, and culverts within those cities in the county the governing bodies of which by ordinance or resolution authorize such work of acquisition of any real property or interest therein, or rights-of-way, construction, maintenance, improvement or repair.

None of the amounts paid to the counties shall be used for the construction or improvement of any highway or street if the contract for such construction or improvement specifies the use of any patented or proprietary paving material, unless the contract has been awarded to the lowest responsible bidder therefor after alternate bids have been called for and opportunity afforded for bids to be submitted for nonpatented or nonproprietary paving material in competition with an equal thickness and like design of such patented or proprietary paving material. This section shall not be deemed nor construed to prohibit the use of any patented or proprietary paving material in the maintenance of any highway or street when such highway or street has been constructed of such material and, in the opinion of the body, board or officer ordering such maintenance, it would be impractical to use a different paving material for such maintenance.



######### 1624.  
The board of supervisors of any county may, as provided in Section 1625, expend any portion of the amounts paid to that county, and deposited in the road fund, for the acquisition of rights-of-way and the construction of any public highway outside of its county limits, whenever such construction is authorized by ordinance or resolution of the board of supervisors of the county in which the highway is to be constructed or for the acquisition of rights-of-way for, or the construction, improvement or maintenance of, any State highway pursuant to a contract made as provided in Section 130.

Where such authorization is given, the board of supervisors of the county desiring the construction may:

(a) Expend, through its own officers or agencies, the amounts authorized by section 1624.

(b) By resolution transfer such amounts to the account of the commission or to the account of the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States, and may by such resolution specify and determine the location and type of construction of such highway.  The amount thus transferred shall, if accepted by the Commission or the Secretary of Agriculture, be expended exclusively for the purpose specified and determined in the resolution.



######### 1626.  
Power hereby is granted to the board of supervisors of any county, to construct, maintain, improve and repair any county highway which in whole or in part forms the boundary line between said county and another county in this State or any other state, or which in its meanderings crosses and recrosses such boundary line; and to acquire by purchase or condemnation any lands or rights-of-way within this State, necessary for such boundary highway; and to enter into joint contracts with authorities of adjoining counties within or without the State, for the construction, maintenance, improvement and repair of such highways. Any such highway shall be considered a county highway and expenditures may be made thereon from funds received by the county from the Highway Users Tax Fund to the extent provided by law for county highways.



######### 1627.  
The board of supervisors of any county, by resolution adopted by four-fifths of the members thereof, may establish a county highway right of way acquisition revolving fund, to be used in acquiring rights of way for county highway purposes through purchase or condemnation. Money on deposit in said fund shall at no time exceed one-half of 1 percent of the assessed valuation of the county.



######### 1628.  
The board of supervisors of any county which has established a county highway right of way acquisition revolving fund, may by resolution call an election to obtain authorization for the issuance and sale of bonds to finance the acquisition of rights of way for county highway purposes. Such bonds may be issued if approved by two-thirds of the electors voting at any regular or special election called for such purpose, and shall be limited in amount to one-half of 1 percent of the current assessed valuation of the county.



######### 1629.

##### CHAPTER 9. Treasure Island Transportation Management [1967 - 1967.11]  

######### 1967.  
This act shall be known and may be cited as the Treasure Island Transportation Management Act.



######### 1967.1.  
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) It is essential for the economic well-being of the state and the maintenance of a high quality of life that the people of California have efficient transportation systems that will reduce traffic congestion, vehicle miles traveled, and greenhouse gas emissions, and improve travel times and air quality.

(b) In 2006, the Legislature passed Assembly Bill 32 (Ch. 488, Stats. 2006), which enacted the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code), a landmark act that establishes a first-in-the-world comprehensive program of regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve real, quantifiable, cost-effective reductions of greenhouse gases.

(c) Implementation of the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 will require creative and innovative solutions, including strategies designed to integrate land use and transportation measures to reduce vehicle miles traveled and traffic congestion, improve travel times, and encourage transit use.

(d) The proposed development of Treasure Island includes an innovative and comprehensive land use and transportation program designed to discourage motor vehicle usage, reduce vehicle miles traveled, encourage public transit, and serve as a model of sustainable neighborhood development. An element of the transportation program is the use of congestion pricing.

(e) Congestion pricing is a potentially useful tool for influencing the behavior of drivers of private motor vehicles, controlling traffic congestion, and reducing vehicle miles traveled and the production of greenhouse gases. The potential of congestion pricing for this purpose is well documented and has been implemented or is under consideration in a number of prominent, high-traffic cities around the world, including London, Stockholm, and Singapore.

(f) Because Treasure Island is located adjacent to an urban area with a single point of vehicular access, but is easily served by multimodal public transit, it is an ideal candidate for a demonstration program designed to test the feasibility of congestion pricing as a tool to encourage and fund public transit use and reduce vehicle miles traveled in furtherance of the state’s goals to improve regional air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and traffic congestion.

(g) The proposed development of Treasure Island is a leading example of performance-based infrastructure that uses private innovation, access to financing, and management efficiencies to build infrastructure, combined with the social responsibility, environmental awareness, local knowledge, safety requirements, and job generation concerns of the public sector. The proposed transportation program for Treasure Island, including congestion pricing, will further these goals by allowing private development to advance funding and resources for construction of a public transit infrastructure and mixed-use development in a transit-oriented and sustainable manner, then generating from that development congestion pricing fees that will maximize use of public transit and generate revenues to offset the public sector’s costs of public transit facilities and equipment design, construction, operation, and maintenance.

(h) The purpose of the Treasure Island transportation program is to accomplish all of the following:

(1) To facilitate the implementation of an innovative, sustainable transportation program for Treasure Island that will encourage public transit, bicycle, pedestrian, and waterborne modes of transportation, reduce vehicle miles traveled, and minimize the impact of Treasure Island development on the system of state and local roadways affected by the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, as well as on the bridge itself, in furtherance of the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code).

(2) To develop a comprehensive set of transportation demand management programs to encourage and facilitate transit use and to minimize the environmental and other impacts of private motor vehicles traveling to, from, and on Treasure Island.

(3) To manage Treasure Island-related transportation in a sustainable manner, to the extent feasible, with the goal of reducing vehicle miles traveled and minimizing carbon emissions and impacts on air and water quality.

(4) To create a flexible institutional structure that can set parking and congestion pricing rates, monitor the performance of the transportation program, collect revenues, and direct generated revenues to transportation services and programs serving Treasure Island.

(5) To promote multimodal access to, from, and on Treasure Island by a wide range of local, regional, and statewide visitors by providing a reliable source of funding for transportation services and programs serving Treasure Island that will include bus transit service provided by the city’s municipal transportation agency, or its successor agency, and ferry service.

(i) The congestion pricing demonstration program authorized by this act includes an important reporting requirement to the Legislature that will allow the Legislature to assess the success of the program in achieving its goals.

(j) The Treasure Island Development Authority and its private development partner have undertaken numerous technical and economic feasibility studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the transportation program to conserve energy, discourage motor vehicle usage, reduce vehicle miles traveled, increase transit ridership, and deliver significant public infrastructure improvements through public-private partnership.



######### 1967.2.

(c) The commission may amend the adopted guidelines after conducting at least one public hearing.

(d) The guidelines may include streamlining of project delivery by authorizing local or regional transportation agencies to seek commission approval of a letter of no prejudice that allows the agency to expend its own funds in advance of an allocation of funds by the commission, and to be reimbursed at a later time for eligible expenditures. A letter of no prejudice shall only be available to local or regional transportation agencies for moneys that have been identified for future allocation to the applicant agency. Moneys designated pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 2032 shall only be reimbursed when there is funding available in an amount sufficient to make the reimbursement.

######### 2034.  
(a) (1) Before receiving an apportionment of funds under the program pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (h) of Section 2032 from the Controller in a fiscal year, an eligible city or county shall submit to the commission a list of projects proposed to be funded with these funds. Two or more eligible cities, or one or more cities and a county, may propose a project to be jointly funded with these funds. Each city or county that proposes to jointly fund a project shall include its participation in the project in its list of projects submitted to the commission. All projects proposed to receive funding shall be adopted by resolution by the applicable city council or county board of supervisors at a regular public meeting. A proposed jointly funded project shall additionally be endorsed by a memorandum of understanding that is approved by the entities proposing to jointly fund the project and that includes the identity of the project’s lead agency and a description of the individual contributions of each participating city and county to the project. The list of projects proposed to be funded with these funds, including jointly funded projects, shall include a description and the location of each proposed project, a proposed schedule for that project’s completion, and the estimated useful life of the improvement. The project list shall not limit the flexibility of an eligible city or county to fund projects in accordance with local needs and priorities so long as the projects are consistent with subdivision (b) of Section 2030.

(2) The commission shall submit an initial report to the Controller that indicates the cities and counties that have submitted a list of projects as described in this subdivision and that are therefore eligible to receive an apportionment of funds under the program for the applicable fiscal year. If the commission receives a list of projects from a city or county after it submits its initial report to the Controller, the commission shall submit a subsequent report to the Controller that indicates the cities and counties that submitted a list of projects after the commission submitted its initial report.

(3) The Controller, upon receipt of the initial report, shall apportion funds to eligible cities and counties.

(4) (A) For any city or county that is not included in the initial report submitted to the Controller pursuant to paragraph (2), the Controller shall retain the monthly share of funds that would otherwise be apportioned and distributed to the city or county pursuant to paragraph (3).

(B) If the Controller receives a subsequent report from the commission within 90 days of receiving the initial report from the commission that a city or county has become eligible to receive an apportionment, the Controller shall apportion the funds retained pursuant to subparagraph (A) to the city or county.

(C) The Controller shall reapportion to all eligible cities and counties pursuant to the formula in clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 2103 any funds that were retained pursuant to subparagraph (A) but that were not apportioned and distributed pursuant to subparagraph (B).

(b) For each fiscal year, each city or county receiving an apportionment of funds shall, upon expending program funds, submit documentation to the commission that details the expenditures of all funds under the program, including a description and location of each completed project, the amount of funds expended on the project, the completion date, if applicable, and the estimated useful life of the improvement. For projects jointly funded pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), each participating city and county shall submit to the commission the documentation required pursuant to this subdivision.

(c) Before receiving an apportionment of funds under the program pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (h) of Section 2032, an eligible city or county may expend other funds on eligible projects and may reimburse the source of those other funds when it receives its apportionment from the Controller over one or more years.



######### 2036.  
(a) Cities and counties shall maintain their existing commitment of local funds for street, road, and highway purposes in order to remain eligible for an allocation or apportionment of funds pursuant to Section 2032.

(b) In order to receive an allocation or apportionment pursuant to Section 2032, the city or county shall annually expend from its general fund for street, road, and highway purposes an amount not less than the annual average of its expenditures from its general fund during the 2009–10, 2010–11, and 2011–12 fiscal years, as reported to the Controller pursuant to Section 2151. For purposes of this subdivision, in calculating a city’s or county’s annual general fund expenditures and its average general fund expenditures for the 2009–10, 2010–11, and 2011–12 fiscal years, any unrestricted funds that the city or county may expend at its discretion, including vehicle in-lieu tax revenues and revenues from fines and forfeitures, expended for street, road, and highway purposes shall be considered expenditures from the general fund. One-time allocations that have been expended for street and highway purposes, but which may not be available on an ongoing basis, including revenue provided under the Teeter Plan Bond Law of 1994 (Chapter 6.6 (commencing with Section 54773) of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code), shall not be considered when calculating a city’s or county’s annual general fund expenditures.

(c) For any city incorporated after July 1, 2009, the Controller shall calculate an annual average expenditure for the period between July 1, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inclusive, that the city was incorporated.

(d) For purposes of subdivision (b), the Controller may request fiscal data from cities and counties in addition to data provided pursuant to Section 2151, for the 2009–10, 2010–11, and 2011–12 fiscal years. Each city and county shall furnish the data to the Controller not later than 120 days after receiving the request. The Controller may withhold payment to cities and counties that do not comply with the request for information or that provide incomplete data.

(e) The Controller may perform audits to ensure compliance with subdivision (b) when deemed necessary.

(1) For any city or county that has not complied with subdivision (b), the Controller shall withhold from its apportionment pursuant to Section 2032 for a fiscal year following an audit an amount up to the amount of funds that the city or county received during the fiscal year that was audited. The amount withheld shall be reapportioned in one annual payment pursuant to paragraph (3).

(2) If the amount to be apportioned pursuant to Section 2032 is less than the amount to be withheld pursuant to paragraph (1), the city or county shall reimburse the state for the difference between the amount withheld and the apportionment that was received during the fiscal year that was audited. If the city or county is ineligible for an apportionment pursuant to Section 2032, the city or county shall reimburse the state in an amount equal to the allocation or apportionment it received in the fiscal year that was audited.

(3) Any funds withheld or returned as a result of a failure to comply with subdivision (b) shall be reallocated or reapportioned to the other counties or cities whose expenditures are in compliance during the fiscal year that the funds are withheld or returned. The reallocation or reapportionment shall be pursuant to the formula in clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 2103.

(4) The Controller may adopt any rules, regulations, and procedures necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.

(f) If a city or county fails to comply with the requirements of subdivision (b) in a particular fiscal year, the city or county may expend during that fiscal year and the following fiscal year a total amount that is not less than the total amount required to be expended for those fiscal years for purposes of complying with subdivision (b).

(g) For the 2019–20 fiscal year, cities and counties are not required to comply with the annual expenditure requirements set forth in subdivision (b) or (c).

(h) For the 2020–21 fiscal year, the Controller shall adjust the annual expenditure requirements in subdivisions (b) and (c) in proportion to any decrease in taxable sales within the applicable city or county from the 2018–19 fiscal year to the 2019–20 fiscal year. The Controller shall not make an adjustment if taxable sales increased.

(i) For the 2021–22 fiscal year, the Controller shall adjust the annual expenditure requirements in subdivisions (b) and (c) in proportion to any decrease in taxable sales within the applicable city or county from the 2018–19 fiscal year to the 2020–21 fiscal year. The Controller shall not make an adjustment if taxable sales increased.

(j) A city or county may petition the Controller to use transient occupancy tax revenues, in lieu of taxable sales, for purposes of adjusting the calculation in subdivision (i), if transient occupancy tax revenues in the 2018–19 fiscal year exceeded the amount determined in subdivision (b) and the amount of decrease in transient occupancy tax revenues from the 2018–19 fiscal year to the 2020–21 fiscal year exceeds the amount of decrease in sales and use tax revenues from the 2018–19 fiscal year to the 2020–21 fiscal year.



######### 2037.  
A city or county may spend its apportionment of funds under the program on transportation priorities other than those allowable pursuant to this chapter if the city’s or county’s average Pavement Condition Index meets or exceeds 80.



######### 2038.  
(a) The California Workforce Development Board shall develop guidelines for public agencies receiving Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Account funds to participate in, invest in, or partner with, new or existing preapprenticeship training programs established pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 14230 of the Unemployment Insurance Code. The department and local agencies that receive Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Account funds pursuant to this chapter shall, not later than July 1, 2023, follow the guidelines set forth by the board. The board shall also establish a preapprenticeship development and training grant program, beginning January 1, 2019, pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 14230 of the Unemployment Insurance Code. Local public agencies that receive Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Account funds pursuant to this chapter are eligible to compete for such grants and may apply in partnership with other agencies and entities, including those with existing preapprenticeship programs. Successful grant applicants shall, to the extent feasible:

(1) Follow the multicraft core curriculum implemented by the State Department of Education for its pilot project with the California Partnership Academies and by the California Workforce Development Board and local boards.

(2) Include a plan for outreach to and retention of women participants in the preapprenticeship program to help increase the representation of women in the building and construction trades.

(3) Include a plan for outreach to and retention of minority participants and underrepresented subgroups in the preapprenticeship program to help increase their representation in the building and construction trades.

(4) Include a plan for outreach to and retention of disadvantaged youth participants in the preapprenticeship program to help increase their employment opportunities in the building and construction trades.

(5) Include a plan for outreach to individuals in the local labor market area and to formerly incarcerated individuals to provide pathways to employment and training.

(6) Coordinate with local state-approved apprenticeship programs, local building trade councils, and to the extent possible the California Conservation Corps and certified community conservation corps, so individuals who have completed these programs have a pathway to continued employment.

(b) As a condition of receiving a grant, grantees shall collect demographic data from participants and shall report this data to the California Workforce Development Board. The California Workforce Development Board shall provide technical assistance to grantees on the manner in which to collect this data. The California Workforce Development Board shall annually report this demographic data to the Legislature, detailing the racial, ethnic, and gender makeup of participants in the grant programs. This report shall include demographic data on participation, completion, and placement.







##### CHAPTER 3. Highway Users Tax Account [2100 - 2127]  

######### 2100.  
The Highway Users Tax Fund is continued in existence as the Highway Users Tax Account in the Transportation Tax Fund.

Any reference in any law or regulation to the Highway Users Tax Fund shall be deemed to refer to the Highway Users Tax Account in the Transportation Tax Fund.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Controller may use the funds in the Highway Users Tax Account in the Transportation Tax Fund for cashflow loans to the General Fund as provided in Sections 16310 and 16381 of the Government Code. Any such loan shall be exempt from paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of Section 16310 of the Government Code. Interest shall be paid on all moneys loaned to the General Fund and shall be computed at a rate determined by the Pooled Money Investment Board to be the current earning rate of the fund from which the money is loaned. This subdivision does not authorize any transfer that would interfere with the carrying out of the object for which these funds were created.



######### 2101.  
Notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, all moneys in the Highway Users Tax Account in the Transportation Tax Fund and hereafter received in the account are appropriated for all of the following:

(a) The research, planning, construction, improvement, maintenance, and operation of public streets and highways, including their related public facilities for nonmotorized traffic, the mitigation of their environmental effects, the payment for property taken or damaged for those purposes, and the administrative costs necessarily incurred in the foregoing purposes.

######### 2102.  
Net revenue derived from a tax means the amount of revenue derived from a tax that is deposited into the Highway Users Tax Account in the Transportation Tax Fund.



######### 2103.  
(a) Notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, of the net revenues deposited to the credit of the Highway Users Tax Account that are derived from the increases in the rates of taxes that are imposed pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 7360 and Section 7361.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the following shall occur on a monthly basis:

(1) (A) By the 15th day of every month, the Treasurer’s office, in consultation with the Department of Finance, shall notify the Controller of the amount of debt service that will be paid on each transportation bond during that month.

(B) Within two business days following the 28th day of each month, the Controller shall transfer to the Transportation Debt Service Fund an amount equal to the amount of monthly debt service paid by the General Fund on any bonds issued pursuant to the Seismic Retrofit Bond Act of 1996 (Chapter 12.48 (commencing with Section 8879) of Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code) or any other bonds issued for highway or eligible guideway projects consistent with the requirements applicable to the expenditure of revenues under Article XIX of the California Constitution as identified by the Department of Finance pursuant to Section 16965 of the Government Code, and three-quarters of the amount of monthly debt service paid on any bonds issued pursuant to the Highway Safety, Traffic Reduction, Air Quality, and Port Security Bond Act of 2006 (Chapter 12.49 (commencing with Section 8879.20) of Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code) for reimbursement of the General Fund for these costs. If revenues available pursuant to this subdivision in any given month are insufficient to fully reimburse the General Fund for the debt service payments made, the first revenues available pursuant to this subdivision in the following month or months shall be transferred to the Transportation Debt Service Fund so that all debt service payments made on these bonds from the General Fund in a given fiscal year are fully reimbursed. No further transfers shall be made pursuant to this subparagraph once the transfers for the months of July to October, inclusive, in 2010 have been made. Any transfers made from the net revenues identified in this paragraph for highway and eligible guideway bond debt service for months after October 2010 shall be reversed and shall instead be made from weight fee revenues in the State Highway Account, as described in subparagraph (F).

(C) Beginning November 2, 2010, the Controller shall transfer to the State Highway Account within two business days following the 28th day of each month all of the monthly net revenues identified in subparagraph (B) that were designated for highway and eligible guideway bond debt service reimbursement but that have not been transferred, or that were transferred by means of a transfer that was reversed, pursuant to that subparagraph. To the extent the Controller has distributed any of those net revenues to cities and counties pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph (3) between November 2, 2010, and March 24, 2011, the Controller shall subsequently reduce the amount transferred to cities and counties on a monthly basis pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph (3) and shall instead transfer these funds to the State Highway Account until all of the revenues that would otherwise have been transferred to the State Highway Account on and after November 2, 2010, pursuant to this subparagraph have been so transferred. For the 2011–12 fiscal year, the Controller shall transfer to the State Highway Account within two business days following the 28th day of each month an amount equal to the weight fee revenues transferred to the Transportation Debt Service Fund pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 9400.4 of the Vehicle Code, including forty-three million seven hundred thousand dollars ($43,700,000) authorized pursuant to Item 2660-013-0042 of Section 2.00 of the Budget Act of 2011 and an amount equal to weight fee revenues transferred to the General Fund as a loan pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 9400.4 of the Vehicle Code. To the extent the Controller has distributed any of those revenues to cities and counties pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph (3), the Controller shall subsequently reduce the amount transferred to cities and counties on a monthly basis pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph (3) and instead transfer these funds to the State Highway Account until all of the revenues that would otherwise have been transferred to the State Highway Account in the 2011–12 fiscal year pursuant to this subparagraph have been so transferred.

(D) Notwithstanding subparagraph (C), commencing with the 2012–13 fiscal year and every fiscal year thereafter, the Controller shall transfer to the State Highway Account within two business days following the 28th day of each month an amount equal to the amount of weight fee revenues transferred to the Transportation Debt Service Fund for highway and eligible guideway bond debt service and to the General Fund as a loan pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 9400.4 of the Vehicle Code.

(E) Beginning July 1, 2011, transfers made under subparagraphs (C) and (D) during a fiscal year shall not exceed the annual revenue generated from weight fees, as determined by Sections 9400.4 and 42205 of the Vehicle Code, at the rates in effect as of March 24, 2011, as determined by the Department of Finance.

(F) Any remaining amount of the highway or eligible guideway bond debt service reimbursement authorized by this paragraph that has not been made pursuant to subparagraph (B) on and after November 2, 2010, shall instead be made pursuant to subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) of Section 9400.4 of the Vehicle Code from revenues in the State Highway Account derived from weight fees deposited in the account pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 9400.1 and Section 42205 of the Vehicle Code.

(2) (A) In the 2010–11 fiscal year, after the monthly transfer made pursuant to paragraph (1), the sum of fifty-four million one hundred sixty-seven thousand dollars ($54,167,000) per month shall be held in the account for future appropriation by the Legislature.

(B) Notwithstanding any other law, with respect to the monthly net revenues described in subparagraph (A), no further transfers of these revenues for the purpose of loans to the General Fund shall be made pursuant to Item 2660-011-0062 of Section 2.00 of the Budget Act of 2010 once the loan transfers for the months of July to October, inclusive, in 2010 have been made. Notwithstanding the loan repayment date specified in the provisional language for that item, the funds loaned shall be repaid by June 30, 2021. Any transfers made from the monthly net revenues in subparagraph (A) for months after October 2010 shall be reversed and shall instead be made from weight fee revenues in the State Highway Account, as described in subparagraph (D). The revenues from loan repayments shall be held in the Highway Users Tax Account for future appropriation by the Legislature.

(C) Beginning November 2, 2010, all of the monthly net revenues described in subparagraph (A) shall instead be transferred by the Controller to the State Highway Account within two business days following the 28th day of each month. To the extent that the Controller has distributed any of the revenues identified in this paragraph to cities and counties pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph (3) between October 14, 2010, and March 24, 2011, the Controller shall subsequently reduce the amount transferred to cities and counties on a monthly basis pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph (3) and shall instead transfer these funds to the State Highway Account until all of the revenues that would have been transferred to the General Fund as a loan pursuant to Item 2660-011-0062 of Section 2.00 of the Budget Act of 2010 on and after November 2, 2010, have instead been transferred to the State Highway Account.

(D) Any remaining amount of the loans to the General Fund authorized pursuant to Item 2660-011-0062 of Section 2.00 of the Budget Act of 2010 that has not been made pursuant to subparagraph (B) on and after November 2, 2010, shall instead be made pursuant to Section 9400.4 of the Vehicle Code from revenues in the State Highway Account derived from weight fees deposited in the account pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 9400.1 and Section 42205 of the Vehicle Code.

(3) The Controller shall transfer any remaining net revenues subject to this subdivision as follows:

(A) Forty-four percent shall be transferred to the State Highway Account to fund projects in the State Transportation Improvement Program that are consistent with Section 2 of Article XIX of the California Constitution.

For purposes of apportioning funds under this subclause, any roads within the boundaries of a city and county that are not state highways shall be deemed to be county roads.

(b) After the transfers or other actions pursuant to subdivision (a), at least 90 percent of the balance deposited to the credit of the Highway Users Tax Account in the Transportation Tax Fund by the 28th day of each month shall be apportioned or transferred, as applicable, by the Controller by the seventh working day thereafter. These apportionments or transfers shall be made as provided for in Sections 2104 to 2122, inclusive.

(b) (1) The amount to be allocated to a city, including a city and county, equals the amount available for allocation to the cities pursuant to subdivision (a) times the ratio of the total allocation it received pursuant to Section 2107 over all allocations made pursuant to that section during the prior fiscal year. 

(2) In the case of a city whose incorporation was effective between July 1, 1984, and October 2, 1986, inclusive, and which did not receive the equivalent of a full year allocation of funds appropriated for allocation pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 7 of Chapter 1600 of the Statutes of 1985 or pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, the amount calculated for allocation pursuant to subdivision (b) of that Section 7 shall be increased by an amount which will provide the city an amount equivalent to the total allocation it would have received pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) of that Section 7 and subdivision (a) of this section.

(c) Fifty-five percent of the funds payable under this section to counties, including a city and county, shall be apportioned among the counties in the proportion that the number of fee-paid and exempt vehicles registered in each county bears to the total number of fee-paid and exempt vehicles which are registered in the state.

Forty-five percent of the funds payable under this section to counties, including a city and county, shall be apportioned among the counties in the proportion that the number of miles of maintained county roads in each county bears to the total number of miles of maintained county roads in the state.

(d) For purposes of this section:

(1) “Maintenance” means (A) patching and (B) overlay and sealing.

(2) “Reconstruction” does not include widening to increase the traffic capacity of a street or highway, but does include any widening of the roadway if the widening is necessary to bring the roadway width to the desirable minimum width consistent with the geometric design criteria of the department for nonfreeway 3R (reconstruction, resurfacing, and rehabilitation) projects.

(e) The Controller shall allocate the funds available for that Item 9675-101-890 within 30 days after they become available to the state.



######### 2127.  
(a) (1) Except in the case of a city or county which has made an election pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3) of this subdivision, in order to receive any allocation pursuant to Section 2126 or Section 7 of Chapter 1600 of the Statutes of 1985, the city or county, as the case may be, shall expend for the maintenance and reconstruction, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 2126, of its local street and highway system during the fiscal year that it receives an allocation pursuant to Section 2126 or that Section 7 not less than its base year expenditure, excluding the allocation received pursuant to Section 2126 or that Section 7, or both, during the fiscal year. 

(2) A city or county may elect to expend during the two fiscal years that it receives an allocation, a total amount which is not less than twice the amount of its base year expenditure. 

(3) A city may elect to expend, during the two fiscal years that it receives an allocation and the following fiscal year, a total amount which is not less than three times the amount of its base year expenditure. This paragraph applies only to the Cities of Bakersfield, El Segundo, Novato, Oceanside, San Mateo, San Rafael, Santa Maria, Seal Beach, and Westminster. For the purposes of this paragraph, either actual expenditures or funds encumbered by contractual obligations in the 1987–88 fiscal year shall qualify as expenditures in the year after allocations are received. 

(4) Any city, except the Cities of Bakersfield, El Segundo, Novato, San Rafael, and Santa Maria, or county making an election pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3) shall so notify the Controller by December 31, 1987, and a city or county which fails to do so shall be governed by paragraph (1). 

(5) Any city or county with a population of 40,000 or less which makes an election pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3) and which expends funds pursuant to that election by October 30, 1988, shall be deemed to have notified the Controller pursuant to paragraph (4). 

(6) This subdivision does not apply to a city or a county, including a city which filed a notice with the Controller pursuant to subdivision (g), with a population of 10,000 or less, as most recently determined by the Department of Finance. 

(b) The amount allocated to a city or a county, as the case may be, shall be expended by October 30, 1988.

(c) (1) For purposes of this section, “base year expenditure” means the amount that the city or county, as the case may be, expended for patching, overlay, and sealing, and reconstruction of its local street and highway system during the 1984–85 fiscal year, as reported to the Controller pursuant to Section 2151. Any city or county, with a population of 100,000 or less as of October 1, 1986, which filed a notice with the Controller pursuant to subdivision (g), may elect to have its “base year expenditure” determined on the basis of its 1983–84 fiscal year expenditures. A city or county making this election shall so notify the Controller by December 31, 1987, and the election shall not be available to a city or county which does not so notify the Controller. 

(2) If the sum of the revenue received by a city or county during the fiscal year pursuant to Section 500 of Title 16, Section 104(b)(2) and (6) and Sections 125 and 144 of Title 23, and Chapter 68 (commencing with Section 5121) of Title 42 of the United States Code, and from the federal Community Block Grant Program, the federal Revenue Sharing Program, and transit assistance funds from the Transportation Planning and Development Account, which was expended for the maintenance and reconstruction of its local street and highway system during the 1984–85 fiscal year, as reported to the Controller pursuant to Section 2151, is more than the sum of funds it received from those sources during any fiscal year, the base year expenditure of the city or county, as the case may be, for the fiscal year shall be reduced by the difference between the sums. For purposes of this paragraph, “revenue received” means that percentage of the project expenditures or the maximum reimbursable amount of eligible project costs as agreed upon by the federal government and the local agency for those projects eligible under this paragraph. 

(d) For each fiscal year during which an allocation was made pursuant to Section 2126 or Section 7 of Chapter 1600 of the Statutes of 1985, or both, the Controller shall audit the amount each county and city expended for the maintenance and reconstruction, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 2126, of its local street and highway system during the fiscal year. For amounts allocated to counties and cities for expenditure by October 30, 1988, the audit shall be completed by October 30, 1990. 

(e) (1) If the Controller determines pursuant to subdivision (d) that a county or city, for the fiscal year, expended for the maintenance and reconstruction of its local street and highway system less than the required amount determined pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b), its allocation pursuant to Section 2104 or 2107, as the case may be, shall be reduced during the next fiscal year by the amount that its expenditure is less than the required amount, but the amount of the reduction shall not exceed the amount allocated to the city or county in each fiscal year that the city or county received funds pursuant to Section 2126 or Section 7 of Chapter 1600 of the Statutes of 1985. 

(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a city or county during the fiscal year in which it returns to the Controller the allocation it received pursuant to Section 2126 or that Section 7, or both. The city or county shall return the allocation plus any accrued interest within 30 days after receipt of the allocation. 

(f) Any funds withheld or returned as a result of subdivision (e) shall be reallocated to the other counties and cities whose expenditure is not less than its required amount pursuant to subdivision (b) or (c) of Section 2126, as the case may be. 

(g) In the case of a city or county which on or before October 1, 1986, files with the Controller a written notice declaring the inability of the city or county to comply with the matching requirement of subdivision (a), the Controller shall postpone the penalty provisions of paragraph (1) of subdivision (e) and shall not reallocate the funds, as provided for by subdivision (f), until September 1, 1987. The notice to the Controller shall contain all of the following: 

(1) The amount of 1984–85 base year matching requirements as determined by the Controller’s audit. 

(2) The amount the local entity will fall short of the base year matching requirement. 

(3) The reasons why the city or county is unable to meet the base year matching requirement. 

(4) The amounts expended by the local entity on patching, overlay, sealing, and reconstruction of its street and highway system in fiscal years 1981–82, 1982–83, and 1983–84. 

The Controller shall, by November 1, 1986, transmit to the Chairpersons of the Senate and Assembly Transportation Committees and the Joint Legislative Budget Committee the information submitted by counties and cities in the written notices provided for in this subdivision.

For construction and maintenance by day labor, the amount shall include the cost of material, labor, equipment, and overhead for work performed thereunder.

(c) The board of supervisors of each county shall by appropriate action, at any regular or special meeting, designate either the county road commissioner or the county auditor as the person responsible for making and signing the report required by this section. When the road commissioner is designated to make and sign the report, the county auditor shall certify the report before it is filed with the Controller. When the county auditor is designated to make and sign the report, the road commissioner shall certify the report before it is filed with the Controller.

##### CHAPTER 4.6. Intercity Corridor Demonstration Program [2170 - 2182.1]  

######### 2170.  
The Legislature finds as follows:

(a) The Sacramento-Stockton-San Franciso corridor and the Los Angeles-San Diego corridor represent unique locations for multimodal transportation demonstration programs with modern low-capital intensive transportation improvement techniques to encourage greater utilization of ground public transportation facilities.  

(b) The conclusions and recommendations contained in the Sacramento-Stockton-San Francisco Bay Area Corridor Study, filed with the Legislature in February of 1975, contained a number of proposals that should be implemented on a demonstration basis.

(c) The conclusions and recommendations contained in the report relating to the Los Angeles-San Diego corridor prepared pursuant to Chapter 1427 of the Statutes of 1974 also contained a number of proposals that should be implemented on a demonstration basis.



######### 2170.5.  
It is the intent of the Legislature that any statewide passenger rail planning shall include consideration of the California Passenger Rail Corridor defined in Section 14036.9 of the Government Code.



######### 2171.  
The department shall undertake three-year demonstration projects to encourage improved ground public transit services along the Sacramento-Stockton -San Francisco corridor and along the Los Angeles-San Diego corridor. The projects shall consist of the following three elements—project administration and evaluation as described in Section 2172, low-capital intensive improvement programs as described in Sections 2173 and 2176.5, and operating assistance as described in Sections 2174, 2175, and 2176.



######### 2172.  
The department shall be responsible for the administration, implementation, marketing, and evaluation of the projects. The department shall seek the assistance of an advisory group for each corridor.

The director shall appoint the advisory groups, which shall include representatives from user groups, consumer groups, the various public and private transit  operators serving the area in which the corridor is located, the transportation planning agencies having jurisdiction of the areas within the corridor, the Public Utilities Commission, and other public and private entities affected by projects in the corridor.



######### 2173.  
From funds appropriated for such purposes, the department shall enter into an agreement with the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, pursuant to Section 403(b) of the National Railroad Passenger Service Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. Sec. 563(b)), for improvement of railroad track and passenger facilities along the Sacramento-Oakland and Los Angeles-San Diego corridors.

First priority shall be given to those improvements which the department determines make possible time savings, such as those identified in the report prepared pursuant to Chapter 1427 of the Statutes of 1974.



######### 2174.  
From funds appropriated for such purposes, the department shall enter into an agreement with the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, pursuant to Section 403(b) of the National Railroad Passenger Service Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. Sec. 563(b)), for additional passenger rail service along the Sacramento-San Francisco and Los Angeles-San Diego corridors.



######### 2174.5.  
No funds shall be allocated for improvements along the Los Angeles-San Diego corridor until the director determines that an average of four or more passenger trains per day are operating over the facilities to be improved.



######### 2175.  
From funds appropriated for such purposes, the department may undertake a program to provide feeder bus service between major population or activity centers and the nearest rail terminal served under Section 2174. The service shall be provided by operators, as defined in Section 99210 of the Public Utilities Code, or by passenger stage corporations, as defined in Section 226 of the Public Utilities Code.



######### 2176.  
From funds appropriated for such purposes, the department may undertake a program to provide express bus service between Stockton and a station of the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District selected by the department and the district or between Stockton and Sacramento. The service shall be provided by operators, as defined in Section 99210 of the Public Utilities Code, or by passenger stage corporations, as defined in Section 226 of the Public Utilities Code.



######### 2176.5.  
From funds appropriated for such purposes, the department may undertake the construction of intermodal transfer facilities located in conjunction with other rail and bus facilities in communities between Stockton and communities in the San Francisco Bay area or between Stockton and Sacramento.

From funds appropriated by Section 4 of Chapter 1130 of the Statutes of 1975, the director shall make allocations to extend corridor rail services beyond the terminals identified in Section 2171 to population and activity centers which the director determines would give the greatest increase in patronage, relative to cost.



######### 2178.  
The department shall seek federal and local financial assistance in financing the projects.



######### 2180.  
When considering the feasibility of rail access from the San Francisco Bay area to Sacramento and Stockton, the department shall explore, for future development, the feasibility of providing such access through connection to the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District transit system in the vicinity of corridors formed by State Highway Routes 4, 24, and 680. The department, in consultation with the district, shall also explore the feasibility of limited extension of the district’s rail system to the vicinity of Concord along the Sacramento Northern rights-of-way.



######### 2182.  
(a) The funds appropriated from the Traffic Congestion Relief Fund pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 14556.5 of the Government Code shall be allocated by the Controller to cities and counties for street and road maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction.  Four hundred million dollars ($400,000,000) shall be allocated to the counties, including a city and county, and cities, including a city and county, as follows:

(1) Fifty percent to the counties, including a city and county, in accordance with the following formulas:

(A) Seventy-five percent of the funds payable under this paragraph shall be apportioned among the counties in the proportion that the number of fee-paid and exempt vehicles that are registered in the county bears to the number of fee-paid and exempt vehicles registered in the state.

(B) Twenty-five percent of the funds payable under this paragraph shall be apportioned among the counties in the proportion that the number of miles of maintained county roads in each county bears to the total number of miles of maintained county roads in the state.  For the purposes of apportioning funds under this subparagraph, any roads within the boundaries of a city and county that are not state highways shall be deemed to be county roads.

(2) Fifty percent to cities, including a city and county, apportioned among the cities in the proportion that the total population of the city bears to the total population of all the cities in the state.

(b) Funds received under this section shall be deposited as follows in order to avoid the commingling of those funds with other local funds:

(1) In the case of a city, into the city account that is designated for the receipt of state funds allocated for transportation purposes.

(2) In the case of a county, into the county road fund.

(3) In the case of a city and county, into a local account that is designated for the receipt of state funds allocated for transportation purposes.

(c) Funds apportioned to a city or county under this section shall be used only for street and highway pavement maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction of necessary associated facilities such as drainage and traffic control devices.  Rehabilitation or reconstruction may include widening necessary to bring the roadway width to the desirable minimum pavement width consistent with accepted design standards for local streets and roads, but does not include widening or increasing the traffic capacity of a street or road.

(d) For the purpose of allocating funds under this section to cities, counties, and a city and county, the Controller shall use the most recent population estimates prepared by the Demographic Research Unit of the Department of Finance.  For a city that incorporated after January 1, 1998, that does not appear on the most recent population estimates prepared by the Demographic Research Unit, the Controller shall use the population determined for that city under Section 11005.3 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

##### CHAPTER 6.5. Federal Aid for Highway Safety Improvements [2330 - 2334]  

######### 2330.  
This chapter may be cited as the Federal Aid for Highway Safety Improvements Act.



######### 2331.  
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act-A Legacy for Users of 2005 (Public Law 109-059), also known as SAFETEA-LU, elevated the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) to a core program (23 U.S.C. Sec. 148). SAFETEA-LU authorized appropriations for programs relating to highway safety improvements that can reduce the number of fatal and serious injury accidents. The core HSIP program includes two set-aside programs: the railway-highway crossing program (23 U.S.C. Sec. 130) and the high-risk rural roads program (23 U.S.C. Sec. 148(f)). The purpose of this chapter is to implement these programs in this state. The commission, the department, boards of supervisors, and city councils are authorized to do all things necessary in their respective jurisdictions to secure and expend federal funds in accordance with the intent of that federal act and this chapter, and to coordinate with local law enforcement agencies’ community policing efforts.



######### 2332.  
All funds received pursuant to these federal programs shall be deposited in the State Highway Account in the State Transportation Fund. All funds apportioned to the state for such programs are appropriated for allocation by the commission in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.



######### 2333.  
In each annual proposed budget prepared pursuant to Section 165, there shall be included an amount equal to the estimated apportionment available from the federal government for the programs described in Sections 2331 and 2333.5. The commission may allocate a portion of those funds each year for use on city streets and county roads. It is the intent of the Legislature that the commission allocate the total funds received from the federal government under Section 148 of Title 23 of the United States Code in approximately equal amounts between state highways and local roads. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the share of any railroad of the cost of maintaining railroad crossing protection facilities funded, in whole or in part, by funds described in Section 2331 shall be the same share it would be if no federal funds were involved and the crossing protection facilities were funded pursuant to an order of the Public Utilities Commission pursuant to Section 1202 of the Public Utilities Code; and in case of dispute, the Public Utilities Commission shall determine that share pursuant to this section.



######### 2334.  
Expenditure of such funds on local streets and roads shall be exempt from the provisions of Sections 188 and 188.8.






#### CHAPTER 7. Federal Aid for Urban Systems [2350 - 2360]  


##### ARTICLE 1. General Provisions [2350 - 2352]  

######### 2350.  
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Federal Aid for Urban Systems Act.



######### 2351.  
The Federal-Aid Highway Acts of 1970 and 1973 have authorized appropriations for expenditure on the federal-aid urban system within the designated boundaries of urban and urbanized areas for street and highway projects and for public mass transit projects, including the purchase of equipment. The purpose of this chapter is to implement such program in this state. The boards of supervisors, city councils, the department, and the commission are authorized to do all things possible in their respective jurisdictions to secure the federal funds for use on construction of county highways, city streets, and state highways, and for public mass transit projects, in accordance with the intent of the federal act and of this chapter.



######### 2352.  
The Legislature recognizes that federal aid for urban systems was deleted from federal law by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-240), and that a period of time is required to account for expenditures of apportionments of federal funds provided for these purposes under previous federal transportation acts. This chapter shall remain in effect until the director determines that apportionments of all federal aid for urban systems have been expended. Upon making that determination, the director shall submit a notice to that effect to the Secretary of State, and this chapter shall be repealed on the January 1 following the receipt of that notice by the Secretary of State.








##### ARTICLE 2. Administration [2356 - 2360]

(b) Expenditures of federal urban system funds, or federal general funds substituted therefor, shall be exempt from the provisions of Sections 188 and  188.8.

(c) Counties and cities may use any funds available to them to match funds made available to them, if the use of funds for such matching purposes is not prohibited by federal law or regulations.



######### 2360.  
Funds apportioned by the United States Secretary of Transportation to public entities in California for federal-aid urban system projects shall be obligated by the recipient public entity within three years of the year of the apportionment of the funds to the state by the secretary.

Any federal-aid urban funds that are not obligated within the three-year period shall be reapportioned by the department to other projects under terms and conditions established by the department and approved by the FAU Systems Advisory Committee.  The public entity receiving a reapportionment shall compensate the recipient of the original apportionment in an amount equal to at least 60 percent of the amount of the reapportionment.

The director shall notify each public entity six months prior to the end of the three-year period in which the public entity is required to obligate the funds that the department intends to reapportion under this section.  A public entity receiving notification may request a hearing before the FAU Systems Advisory Committee for an extension of the three-year requirement.  The FAU Systems Advisory Committee may grant the public entity an extension of time in which to obligate the funds if it makes a finding that the public entity has shown that the extension is justified.

The department, in cooperation with the FAU Systems Advisory Committee, shall certify that a recipient agency will be able to expend funds based on project readiness and its ability to meet funding requirements.  The department shall provide to the commission all information relating to the reallocation of federal-aid urban funds on the state highway system.  The commission may amend the state transportation improvement plan to reflect changes deemed appropriate by the commission resulting from reallocations.

This section applies to federal-aid urban funds apportioned prior to January 1, 1986, but the three-year period for any funds apportioned prior to January 1, 1986, shall begin on that date.

##### CHAPTER 11. Federal Aid for Rural Highway Public Transportation [2500 - 2507]  

######### 2500.  
This chapter may be cited as the Rural Highway Public Transportation Act.



######### 2501.  
Federal law has authorized appropriations for expenditure for public mass transportation on highways in rural areas in order to enhance access of rural area populations to employment, health care, retail centers, education, and public services. The purpose of this chapter is to implement that program in this state. The boards of supervisors, city councils, and the department are authorized to do all things necessary and proper in their respective jurisdictions to secure the federal funds for use on rural highway public mass transportation projects in accordance with the intent of federal law and of this chapter.



######### 2503.  
As used in this chapter, “rural areas” means areas as defined in Section 101 of Title 23 of the United States Code.



######### 2505.  
The department shall establish operating procedures and take such other appropriate actions to comply with the provisions of this chapter and with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.



######### 2506.  
All applications for federal funds for rural public mass transportation projects under Section 147 of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1973 (Public Law 93-87) shall be made through the department.

#### CHAPTER 12. Federal Aid for Safer Off-System Roads [2520 - 2537]  


##### ARTICLE 1. General Provisions [2520 - 2521]  

######### 2520.  
This chapter may be cited as the Federal Aid for Safer Off-System Roads Act.



######### 2521.  
By the Federal-Aid Highway Amendments of 1974, and the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1976, Congress has enacted Section 219 of Title 23 of the United States Code establishing a Safer Off-System Roads Program for the construction, reconstruction, and improvement (including, but not limited to, the correction of safety hazards, the replacement of bridges and the elimination of high-hazard locations and roadside obstacles) of any toll-free road, which is not on any federal-aid system and which is under the jurisdiction of and maintained by a public authority and open to public travel. Boards of supervisors, city councils, the department, and the commission may do all things necessary and proper in their respective jurisdictions to secure the federal funds available under this program for local roads and state highways in accordance with the intent of the federal act and this chapter.








##### ARTICLE 2. Administration [2530 - 2537]  

######### 2530.  
(a) The federal act provides that sums apportioned to a state under this program be made available for projects throughout the state on a fair and equitable basis.  It is in the interest of the state and its counties and cities that the federal funds made available for the Safer Off-System Roads Program be made available by the commission for use on county roads and city streets.

(b) The funds shall be apportioned among the counties in accordance with the formula prescribed by federal law for apportionment among the states, except that no county shall receive less than one-half of 1 percent of each year’s apportionment.

(c) The distribution of funds among the cities within each county and the county shall be determined by agreement between the county and a majority of the cities, which cities shall include a majority of the municipal population within the county.  A copy of the agreement shall be filed with the department.



######### 2532.  
Within 60 days after the apportionment is made pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 2530, each county shall notify the department as to the amount of the apportionment the county and its cities wish to claim.



######### 2533.  
The county or city responsible for the construction of a safer off-system road project shall prepare the plans, specifications, and estimates of costs for the construction of the project in conformance with federal requirements for off-system roads, shall certify the necessary right-of-way, and shall submit such documents to the department in order to qualify for federal funds.



######### 2534.  
All funds not claimed pursuant to Section 2532 shall lapse.

The lapsed funds of a county may be reallocated for expenditure upon safer off-system road projects of counties and cities within the other counties of the county group, as specified in Section 187, which included that county, based upon their proportional share of the original apportionment within that county group.



######### 2535.  
By agreement with the department, a county or city may transfer all or part of the funds apportioned to it under this chapter to a qualifying safer off-system roads project on a road under other governmental jurisdiction in the same county, or to a qualifying project in another county under such terms and conditions as are agreed upon by the department and the counties or cities, as the case may be, involved.



######### 2537.  
The counties and cities may use any funds available to them to match federal funds made available under this chapter, if the use of funds for such matching purposes is not prohibited by federal law. “Match,” as used in this chapter, means to provide for the payment of the cost of any project to the extent that such cost is not to be reimbursed from federal funds.







##### CHAPTER 13. Abandoned Railroad Lines [2540 - 2549]  

######### 2540.  
The Legislature hereby declares that it is the policy of the state to acquire abandoned railroad lines when the right-of-way for such lines has a potential public transportation use including, but not limited to, a use for highways, busways, bicycles, pedestrians, or guideways.



######### 2542.  
The Abandoned Railroad Account is hereby created in the State Transportation Fund. The money in the Abandoned Railroad Account is appropriated to the department for carrying out the purposes of this chapter.



######### 2544.  
The department shall prepare and submit to the Legislature not later than July 1, 1976, a priority list of abandoned railroad lines having rights-of-way that may be developed for public transportation uses.

In preparing the list, the department shall consider the State Rail Plan prepared pursuant to Section 7701 of the Public Utilities Code and shall also consult with any city, county, transit district, or regional transportation planning entity within whose boundaries those abandoned railroad lines are located.

The department may consider contributions by local agencies toward the purchase of those rights-of-way as a factor in ranking the rights-of-way on the priority list.



######### 2546.  
With money made available for such purpose, the department may acquire any of the rights-of-way included in the priority list prepared pursuant to Section 2544 and shall offer such property to all cities, counties, and transit districts within whose jurisdiction such property is located for development for public transportation purposes. If such public entities indicate an intent to develop such property, the department shall enter into an agreement with them providing for the conveyance of the property for the development of the public transportation use and for such other matters as may be agreed to. If no agreement is reached within three years of the acquisition of the property by the department, such property shall be sold to the highest bidder and the money received shall be deposited in the Abandoned Railroad Account. The department shall acquire the properties in sequence as listed in the priority list unless, for a particular property, the department reasonably determines that (1) the railroad owner is seeking an unreasonably high price for the property; (2) there does not appear to be a public entity willing to enter into an agreement pursuant to this section to develop the property, or (3) the price of the property exceeds the amount of funds available in the Abandoned Railroad Account in the State Transportation Fund.



######### 2548.  
In the name of the people of the State of California or, upon authorization from a city, county, or transit district, in the name of such city, county, or transit district, the department may condemn for public transportation purposes, under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to eminent domain, any right-of-way underlying an abandoned railroad line in fee or any lesser interest found by the department to be necessary.

The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the acquisition of such property is a public necessity and is compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury.



######### 2549.  
(a) Any city, county, transit operator, or the department may submit an application to the department for an advance of funds for the purchase of abandoned railroad rights-of-way pursuant to Section 99317 of the Public Utilities Code.  The department shall evaluate the applications in accordance with criteria and procedures adopted by the commission and shall submit the applications and its recommendations thereon to the commission not later than February 1 of each year.

(b) The commission shall adopt criteria and procedures for the evaluation of applications by the department.  The criteria shall include, but not be limited to all of the following:

(1) The viability of the right-of-way as a transit corridor.

(2) The extent of local financial participation in the acquisition.

(3) The degree to which the unacquired right-of-way is jeopardized by encroaching development.

(c) The commission shall annually adopt a priority list for the advance of funds available for the purpose of this section.  The commission shall establish and forward to all applicants a preliminary list at least 30 days prior to the date of a commission hearing on the list.  The commission shall adopt the priority list, as proposed or as amended, at a subsequent commission hearing following the initial hearing.  The commission shall advance funds available for the purposes of this section in accordance with the adopted priority list.

(d) Any advance of funds pursuant to this section shall be repaid within a three-year period and shall be repaid with interest at a rate equal the interest rate earned on moneys in the Pooled Money Investment Fund.







##### CHAPTER 14. Service Authority for Freeway Emergencies [2550 - 2559]  

######### 2550.  
The Legislature declares that its intent in enacting this chapter is to encourage a motorist aid system comprising multiple service elements and infrastructure along the California Freeway and Expressway System to enable motorists in need of aid to obtain assistance. However, it is not intended that a motorist aid system be considered an emergency system.



######### 2551.  
(a) A service authority for freeway emergencies may be established in any county if the board of supervisors of the county and the city councils of a majority of the cities within the county having a majority of the population of cities within the county adopt resolutions providing for the establishment of the authority.

(f) As used in this chapter, “authority” and “service authority” mean a service authority for freeway emergencies created pursuant to this chapter.



######### 2551.5.  
The board of supervisors, and the city councils of the cities in the county, may authorize the members of the service authority to receive for each attendance at meetings of the service authority, and for each day any member is engaged in authorized service authority business other than attendance at meetings of the service authority, the maximum sum of one hundred dollars ($100), but not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500) in any calendar month, and to be allowed their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the discharge of their duties.



######### 2551.6.  
A service authority may agree to operate the freeway service patrol in the county or region in which the service authority was created.  If another agency is operating a freeway service patrol in the county or region, the service authority shall obtain approval from that agency before operating the freeway service patrol.



######### 2552.  
When the Metropolitan Transportation Commission or the Sacramento Area Council of Governments functions as the service authority for two or more counties, the revenues which it receives pursuant to Section 9250.10 of the Vehicle Code, after retention of amounts necessary to reimburse the commission or the council for its reasonable and necessary administrative costs, shall be expended for implementation, maintenance, and operation of a motorist aid system within those counties. The amount expended for each of those counties shall be in the same proportion as the revenues generated within the county bears to the total revenues received by the commission or the council. Expenditures may be made in a county in addition to revenues proportionately generated if the expenditures are approved by all of the donor county representatives on the service authority.



######### 2553.  
An authority, other than the Metropolitan Transportation Commission or a county transportation commission or a council of governments designated pursuant to Section 2551, shall have seven members, with two members selected by the board of supervisors and five members selected jointly by the city councils of cities within the county.

In addition, a service authority that has entered into one or more leases or lease-purchase agreements for facilities of a motorist aid program may also pledge, as security for the payment of amounts due under the leases or agreements, revenues to be received from those fees.  The pledge of revenues provided for in this subdivision shall be a first and prior lien and, without any action other than the adoption by the members of a resolution providing for the pledge, the lien of the pledge shall attach and become perfected as to each fee imposed pursuant to Section 9250.10 of the Vehicle Code as and when the fee becomes due and payable.  However, if a service authority has, at the same time, existing obligations under one or more issues of revenue bonds, one or more leases or lease-purchase agreements, or both, the respective priorities of the liens of pledges of revenue shall be determined on the basis of the respective dates on which resolutions providing for those pledges were adopted, with the highest priority being accorded the pledge of revenues provided for in the earliest of those resolutions.  Bond proceeds shall not be used for operation of a motorist aid system of call boxes.

(d) This section shall be operative only if funds are appropriated for its purposes in the annual Budget Act.



######### 2562.3.  
In determining the baseline annual funding allocation, regional or local entities shall apply to the department in accordance with operational standards as outlined in the program guidelines and in accordance with the eligibility requirements described in Sections 2561.5 and 2562.1.

######### 2904.  
Whenever an improvement contract has been awarded, the county or city or district or other public corporation, the legislative body of which is conducting the proceeding, shall, if the actual cost of the improvement, including incidental expenses, exceeds the amount that may be specially assessed upon benefited property, pay such excess cost from the general or any fund available and the balance shall be specially assessed under the statute under which the proceeding is conducted.

If the property to be specially assessed is within the jurisdiction of more than one legislative body and consents to such proceeding have been given by all the legislative bodies having jurisdiction, any such legislative body whose consent has been so given may appropriate all or any part of such excess cost from any available funds under its control, and may pay the amount so appropriated into the treasury of the county or city or district or other public corporation whose legislative body has jurisdiction over the proceeding to be applied in payment of such excess.

##### PART 6. MAJORITY PROTEST [2930 - 2932]  

######### 2930.

Any such protest may be withdrawn by the owner making the same, in writing, at any time prior to the conclusion of the protest hearing held pursuant to the law under which it is proposed to proceed or any adjournment thereof.



######### 2931.  
If any majority protest is against only a portion of the improvement or acquisition then all further proceedings to construct that portion of the improvement or to acquire that portion of the acquisition so protested against shall be barred for a period of one year, but the legislative body shall not be barred from commencing new proceedings not including any part of the improvement or acquisition so protested against. Nothing in this act contained shall prohibit the legislative body, within said one-year period, from commencing and carrying on new proceedings for the construction of a portion of the improvement or the acquiring of a portion of the acquisition so protested against if it finds, by the affirmative vote of four-fifths of its members, that the owners of a majority of the property within the area of the assessment district to be established under said new proceedings are in favor of going forward with said portion of the improvement or acquisition.



######### 2932.  
If the acquisition or improvement is for sewerage or drainage facilities only and is deemed by the legislative body conducting the proceedings to be necessary for the inhabitation or use of the property benefited, and such body shall, by a four-fifths vote of all members thereof entered upon its minutes, determine that said project is feasible and that the lands to be assessed will be able to carry the burden of such proposed assessment, it may by like vote overrule a majority protest in the proceedings hereunder or in the improvement proceedings to follow. Such finding and conclusion shall be final and conclusive in the absence of fraud.

The legislative body may establish, change or modify the grade of and order to be done in, over or under the whole, or any portion, either in length or width, of any one or more of the public streets, places, sidewalks, highways, roads, or property or rights of way (including tidelands and submerged lands owned by any city) within the limits of the city which is carrying through the proceeding in question, and also into the limits of other cities or extending from the city through or over one or more other cities, or extending through or over one or more cities and into a county or extending along the exterior boundary between a city and a county, or along the boundary between two cities, whether wholly or partly within or without the boundary, either singly or in any combination thereof, any of the work mentioned in this division under the proceedings described in this division.



######### 5117.  
The city may include within the boundaries of an assessment district created pursuant to this division lands lying within the boundaries of any one or more cities, or counties, when such lands, in the opinion of the legislative body conducting the proceeding, will be benefited by the proposed work if the consent of the legislative body of any territory proposed to be assessed shall first be obtained to the formation of the assessment district and, if any of the proposed work is to be done within such territory, to the work described in the resolution of intention and the assumption of jursidiction thereover for the purposes aforesaid prior to the adoption thereof.



######### 5118.  
The proposed resolution of intention shall be submitted to the legislative bodies which have jurisdiction over the territory into which the proposed work or the assessment district therefor may extend. When the resolution of intention is approved and the consent of the legislative bodies whose consent is necessary is obtained to the work and the formation of the assessment district described therein, the resolution of intention may be adopted. The consent if any shall, of itself, constitute assent to the assumption of jurisdiction thereover for all purposes of the proceeding and authorize the legislative body initiating the proceeding to take each and every step required for or suitable for the consummation of the work extending outside the limits of the city, and the levying, collecting and enforcement of the assessments to cover the expenses thereof and the issuance and enforcement of bonds to represent unpaid assessments.



######### 5119.  
Notwithstanding any other provision, upon obtaining the consent of any city as provided in Sections 5117 and 5118, the board of supervisors of a county may order any work and levy, collect and enforce assessments and issue and enforce assessment bonds to represent unpaid assessments in an assessment district created by it lying wholly within such city.








##### CHAPTER 2.5. Contribution Toward Cost of Work [5125 - 5129]  

######### 5125.  
Notwithstanding any other provision in this division, the legislative body may accept and provide for contribution toward the cost and expenses of any work done under this division, from any funds made available for the purpose by any local, state or national agency or authority, and it shall not be necessary to set forth or give notice of such contribution in the resolution of intention or in any other proceedings under this division.



######### 5126.  
At any time or times prior to confirmation of the assessment, the legislative body of a city conducting a proceeding may provide for a contribution or contributions by said city of part of the costs and expenses of the work.



######### 5127.  
If the assessment district includes property out of the territorial jurisdiction of the city conducting the proceeding, the legislative body of the city having jurisdiction thereover may in its discretion order by resolution, a copy of which shall be transmitted to the legislative body conducting the proceeding, that any part of the cost or expenses of the work shall be paid out of the treasury of the city. A liability for the portion of the cost set forth in the resolution shall thereby be created against the city ordering such contribution.



######### 5128.  
The legislative body may, in its discretion, provide that any contribution being made pursuant to Sections 5125 and 5126 may, to the extent of the fund so designated, be appropriated in such installments as the legislative body may determine provided that the total amount of such installments shall have been appropriated at or prior to the completion of the work.



######### 5129.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the legislative body, by resolution and in accordance with the terms and conditions under which federal funds were made available to it for the benefit of low- and moderate-income households owning and occupying lands, may apply those federal funds to the payment of assessments levied on such lands to finance any work done under this division.








##### CHAPTER 3. Resolution of Intention [5130 - 5136]  

######### 5130.  
Before ordering any work to be done under this division the legislative body shall require, except as provided hereunder, the engineer to furnish it with plans and specifications therefor together with careful estimates of the costs and expenses of such work.

In a county having a population of 4,000,000 or over an owner or owners of lots or lands liable to be assessed for work may engage a registered civil engineer, registered pursuant to Chapter 7, Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code, to prepare the plans for any work to be done under this division.  The legislative body may purchase said plans for use in proceedings under this division and may establish rules, regulations and procedures to be followed by registered civil engineers engaged by owners in preparing plans, submitting them to and obtaining their approval by the engineer and for the time, manner and determination of the amount to be paid for such plans; provided, however, that the amount paid for plans shall not exceed 8% of the engineer’s estimate of the cost of work shown on the plans and that no payment shall be made for any plans which have not been approved by the engineer.  The amount paid for any plans and any fee required to be paid, pursuant to the aforesaid rules and regulations, may be paid out of the city treasury and shall be charged against the district as an incidental expense.



######### 5131.  
Before ordering any work done which is authorized by this division, the legislative body shall pass a resolution of intention to do so, referring to the street by its lawful or official name, or the name by which it is commonly known. If the work is not to be done upon a public street or public way, then by briefly describing the property or right of way on which it is to be constructed, and briefly describing the work.



######### 5132.  
The resolution of intention shall be sufficient if it states in general terms the class or kinds of work contemplated, such as grading, paving, sewering and other work, and gives in general the location of the proposed work and refers to plans, profiles, detailed drawings and specifications or such of them as may be suitable or proper for the full and detailed description of the proposed work, and if it refers to any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 5103.  The resolution of intention shall contain also a notice of the day, hour, and place of the public hearing where any and all persons having any objections to the proposed work or work and acquisition may appear before the legislative body and show cause why the proposed work or work and acquisition should not be carried out in accordance with the resolution of intention.

The notice shall also contain the name and telephone number of a local department or agency designated by the legislative body to answer inquiries regarding the hearing proceedings.  That notice shall be omitted if the hearing of objections is not required as provided hereunder.  The hearing of objections shall not be less than 45 days from the date of the passage of the resolution.



######### 5132.05.  
(a) If the proceedings include any acquisition and the actual cost of the acquisition as finally determined is less than the amount included in the assessment as the cost of the acquisition, the excess may be spent as the legislative body may thereafter determine, either for the maintenance or repair of the work or improvement, or the excess shall be refunded or credited in proportion to the amount of the assessments that were levied for the acquisition cost, as follows:

(1) If the assessment and all installments thereof and all interest and penalties due thereon have been paid, the refund shall be returned in cash to the person who paid the corresponding assessment or installment, upon furnishing satisfactory evidence of the payment.

(2) If the assessment or any installment thereof is unpaid, the credit shall be applied upon the assessment or upon the earliest unpaid installment of principal and interest.

(b) If the legislative body determines that the excess shall be used for maintenance or repair, the legislative body shall establish a separate fund of the excess and shall use it solely for that purpose.



######### 5132.1.  
In addition to the notice included in the resolution of intention, the legislative body shall give notice by mail to the record owner of each identified parcel prior to levying a new or increased assessment, or an existing assessment that is subject to the procedures and approval process set forth in Section 4 of Article XIII D of the California Constitution.  Each such notice shall comply with the provisions of subdivision (b) of Section 53753 of the Government Code.



######### 5132.2.  
Each notice sent pursuant to Section 5132.1 shall contain an assessment ballot that includes that legislative body’s address for receipt of the form and a place where the person returning the assessment ballot may indicate his or her name, a reasonable identification of the parcel, and his or her support or opposition to the proposed assessment.  The form of the assessment ballot shall comply with the provisions of subdivision (c) of Section 53753 of the Government Code.



######### 5132.3.  
At the time, date, and place stated in the notice mailed pursuant to Section 5132.1, the legislative body shall conduct a public hearing upon the proposed assessment in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (d) of Section 53753 of the Government Code.  At the conclusion of the public hearing, the legislative body shall tabulate the assessment ballots submitted and not withdrawn, in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (e) of Section 53753 of the Government Code.  If there is a majority protest against the imposition of a new assessment, or the extension of an existing assessment, or an increase in an existing assessment, the legislative body shall not impose, extend, or increase the assessment.



######### 5132.4.  
If the legislative body has complied with the notice, protest, and hearing provisions set forth in this article, or if the legislative body is not required to comply with those requirements because the assessment is exempt from the procedures and approval process set forth in Section 4 of Article XIII D of the California Constitution, then those requirements shall not apply in subsequent fiscal years unless the assessment methodology is changed to increase the assessment, or the amount of that assessment is proposed to exceed an assessment formula or range of assessments adopted by an agency in accordance with Article XIII D of the California Constitution or Section 53753 of the Government Code.



######### 5133.  
The clerk shall cause the resolution of intention to be published. The first publication shall be made not less than 10 days prior to the date of public hearing stated in said resolution. If the hearing of objections is not required, the first publication shall be within 10 days after the date of passage of the resolution.



######### 5134.  
The legislative body may include in one proceeding, under one resolution of intention and in one contract, any of the different kinds of work mentioned in this division on any number of streets, properties and rights of way or portions thereof, contiguous or otherwise, and it may except therefrom any such work which has already been done.



######### 5135.  
The legislative body may elect to agree to purchase, and purchase, out of the general funds of the city or any other funds eligible for such purpose, an assignment of the warrant, assessment and diagram upon delivery thereof to the contractor, pursuant to Section 5375, at the option of the contractor. Any such purchase shall be at the total amount of the several assessments upon the assessment and diagram attached to the warrant. Any such election to purchase an assignment of the warrant, assessment and diagram by the city shall be stated in the resolution of intention and in the invitation for bids. Upon the purchase of such an assignment of the warrant, assessment and diagram by the city, the city shall succeed to all rights and liens of the contractor to collect and to enforce the payment of the assessments and all bonds issued to represent said assessments.



######### 5135.5.  
When the contractor, at the time of execution of the contract, exercises his option to assign the warrant, assessment, and diagram to the legislative body, payments of installments may be made in the manner provided under the provisions of Section 5374.1 for installment payment of contributions.



######### 5136.  
As an alternative procedure for the doing of work authorized by this division, the legislative body may pass a resolution of intention to do such work containing a provision that the work shall be done if any local, state or national agency or authority accepts the proposed work as a project for which a contribution of labor, or labor and any portion of materials, supplies or equipment will be made by such agency or authority. Under such alternative procedure the work to be done by the contractor shall consist of furnishing any or all of the materials, supplies or equipment necessary for the construction of the improvement. When this alternative procedure is adopted, the resolution of intention shall so state and shall recite what contribution is to be made and by whom. The resolution of intention shall also state what work shall be done by the contractor. In all other particulars, the resolution of intention shall be the same as any resolution of intention adopted pursuant to this chapter.








##### CHAPTER 4. Establishment of Grade for Work [5150 - 5152]  

######### 5150.  
The provisions of this chapter relating to grades are alternative provisions and shall not repeal any other provisions of this division or of this code relating to change of grade.



######### 5150.5.  
The legislative body may, by resolution, establish, change, or modify the official grade of any street, boulevard, park or place which is to be improved pursuant to this division, and the words “official grade” when used in this division shall mean the grade so established, changed, or modified.



######### 5151.  
The grade to which any work shall be done shall be that which is shown on the plans or profiles therefor or it may be done on the grade formally established by the legislative body. If any official grade has already been adopted or established for any of the streets, avenues, or other places or property proposed to be improved, it shall be lawful for the resolution of intention to provide that said work shall be done to new grades or grades different from those so established or adopted, and shall refer to plans, profiles or specifications for the description of the grade at which the work is to be done.



######### 5152.  
Any property owner whose property is to be assessed to pay the costs and expenses of the proposed work may at the time fixed in the resolution of intention for hearing of objections to the proposed work, appear before the legislative body and make objection to the proposed grade or proposed modification of grade. A failure to make objection at that time shall be deemed to be a waiver of all objections to the proposed grade or proposed change or modification of grade and shall operate as a bar to any claim for damages or any subsequent action looking to the prevention of the work or the recovery of damages on account of the performance of the work to such grade or changed grade.








##### CHAPTER 5. Work Affecting Distribution of Domestic Water Supply by Public Agencies [5170 - 5174]  

######### 5170.  
If the work proposed to be done includes the laying of conduits, pipes, hydrants, or any appliance for the supplying or distributing of a domestic water supply, and the distribution of such domestic water supply in the territory in which the work is contemplated is under the management and control of a municipal water district, a municipal utility district, a public utility district, a metropolitan water district, or any public agency other than the city ordering the work done, the conduits, pipes, hydrants, or other appurtenances for supplying or distributing such domestic water supply shall be installed under the proceedings specified in this chapter, which must be taken prior to the adoption of the resolution of intention.



######### 5171.  
Before requiring the plans, specifications and estimates provided for in Section 5130 the legislative body shall pass a resolution requesting the public agency having charge of the supplying and distribution of the domestic water supply in the district about to be improved to furnish to the legislative body plans and specifications for adequate and appropriate conduits, pipes, hydrants and other appurtenances necessary for that purpose. It shall be the duty of such public agency to furnish the plans and specifications so required, and the plans and specifications shall be submitted to the legislative body for its approval. The cost of the preparation of such plans and specifications shall form a part of the incidental expenses of the work.



######### 5172.  
The legislative body may adopt the plans and specifications furnished to it, but may not modify or change the same except with the consent of the public agency furnishing the plans and specifications. If no agreement can be reached the conduits, pipes and other appurtenances for supplying the water shall be omitted from the contemplated improvement. If the plans and specifications are adopted by the legislative body the engineer shall incorporate the plans and specifications in the plans and specifications furnished by him to the legislative body pursuant to Section 5130, and the plans and specifications shall thereupon be deemed incorporated in the plans and specifications for doing the work.



######### 5173.  
The public agency which supplies the plans and specifications may at all times maintain an inspector over the work to see that the plans and specifications which it has furnished have been complied with, and the cost of such inspection shall form a part of the incidental expenses of the work and be incorporated in the assessment as a part thereof.



######### 5174.  
After the work has been completed and accepted, title to the pipes, conduits, and other appliances for supplying or distributing water so installed shall vest in such public agency and constitute a part of its system supplying the water, and shall at all times thereafter be used, operated, maintained, and managed by it as a part of such system.








##### CHAPTER 6. Creating Assessment Districts [5180 - 5182]  

######### 5180.  
The legislative body shall make the expense of such work chargeable upon a district, which the legislative body shall, in its resolution of intention, declare to be the district benefited by the work, and to be assessed to pay the cost and expense thereof. The territory comprising said district may, but need not, include all, or be confined to, or extend beyond, the lots or lands fronting upon the improvement, or be contiguous, and the district may consist of separate and distinct areas or sections. The work performed in one section need not benefit the other section or sections.



######### 5181.  
The district may be described by:

(a) Stating its exterior boundaries; or

(b) Giving a description thereof according to any official or recorded map; or 

(c) Referring to a plat or map on file in the office of the clerk or engineer at the time of passing the resolution of intention, which shall indicate by a boundary line the extent of the territory included in the proposed district, and shall govern for all details as to the extent of the assessment district.



######### 5182.  
The assessment district need not be described in any of the notices, resolutions, orders or determinations provided for in this division, other than the resolution of intention. Any description of said district in any of the same shall be sufficient, if it refers to the resolution of intention for a description of the district.








##### CHAPTER 7. Notice of Improvement [5194 - 5198]  

######### 5194.  
The legislative body shall appoint the time and place of the hearing on the resolution of intention and shall cause notice of that hearing and the public meeting required by Section 54954.6 of the Government Code to be mailed as provided in subdivision (c) of that section.



######### 5196.  
If the doing of the work requires a change of grade of any railroad track or tracks, the legislative body shall direct the clerk to mail to the owner or reputed owner or operator or reputed operator thereof, at its last known address as the same appears on the tax rolls of the city, the legislative body of which is conducting the proceeding, or when no address so appears then to such owner or operator in care of general delivery in such city and to the Public Utilities Commission, printed copies of the resolution of intention within five days after the first publication thereof. Failure to mail said copies or failure of any such owner or operator to receive the same or any erroneous address thereon shall not affect the jurisdiction of the legislative body, but in such event the failure of the owner or operator of such tracks to make objection to the proposed grades shall not be deemed to be a waiver of all objections to the proposed grades or proposed change or modification of grade, nor operate as a bar to any claim for damages, if recoverable damages there be.



######### 5198.  
This chapter shall not apply if the hearing of objections is not required pursuant to Section 5132.








##### CHAPTER 8. Protest and Hearing [5221.5 - 5227]  

######### 5221.5.  
In lieu of hearing and passing upon protests as provided in Section 5221, the legislative body may continue the hearing of protests to a day certain and refer the protests to the superintendent of streets for investigation, report and recommendation as to the improvement and matters included in the protests. The report and recommendation of the superintendent of streets shall be in writing, and a copy thereof shall be mailed not less than five days prior to the continued hearing date for protests to each person owning property liable to be assessed who has made a written protest. At the time set for the continued hearing the legislative body shall hear and pass upon the report and recommendation of the superintendent of streets and its decision shall be final. The legislative body may adjourn the hearing from time to time. Protests may be withdrawn in the same manner as provided in Section 5221.



######### 5223.  
If it shall be necessary, in order to find whether a majority protest exists, to determine whether any or all of the signers of written protests are the “owners” of property to be assessed, the legislative body shall make such determination from the last equalized assessment roll, any written evidence submitted with a written protest and any other evidence received at the hearing. The legislative body shall be under no duty to obtain or consider any other evidence as to ownership of property and its determination of ownership shall be final and conclusive.



######### 5225.  
If no protests or objections in writing have been delivered to the clerk up to the hour set for the hearing thereon or if protests have been found by the legislative body to be insufficient, or have been overruled, or if protests against the extent of the proposed district have been heard and denied, immediately thereupon the legislative body shall acquire jurisdiction to order the proposed work to be done.

If the hearing of objections is not required, pursuant to Section 5132, immediately upon passage of the resolution of intention the legislative body shall acquire jurisdiction to order the proposed work to be done.



######### 5227.  
Nothing in this act contained shall prohibit the legislative body, within said one-year period referred to in Section 5222 hereof, from commencing and carrying on new proceedings for the construction of a portion of the improvement so protested against if it finds, by the affirmative vote of four-fifths of its members, that the owners of a majority of the property within the area of the assessment district to be established under said new proceedings are in favor of going forward with said portion of the improvement.








##### CHAPTER 13. General Provisions Relating to Assessments [5300 - 5305]  

######### 5300.  
Whenever a railroad, street, or interurban railroad right-of-way shall be included within any district to be assessed for the cost of any work provided in this division, such railroad right-of-way (whether it is owned in fee or as an easement) shall be included in the warrant, assessment, and diagram. Such railroad right-of-way shall be assessed only if, and to the extent that, it is found that it will benefit from the proposed improvement, and such railroad, street, or interurban railroad right-of-way shall be subject to sale for nonpayment of assessments as provided in this division. In determining whether or not such railroad right-of-way benefits its use as a right-of-way for a railroad shall be presumed to be permanent.



######### 5301.  
If a lot or parcel of land belonging to the United States, or to the state, or to a county, city, public agent, mandatory of the government, school board, educational, penal or reform institution, or facility for the housing of persons with developmental or intellectual disabilities or mental health disorders is in use in the performance of a public function, and is included within the district to be assessed to pay the costs and expenses thereof, the legislative body may, in the resolution of intention, declare that the lots or parcels of land, or any of them, shall be omitted from the assessment thereafter to be made to cover the costs and expenses of the work.



######### 5302.  
If any such lots or parcels of land are omitted from the assessment, the total expense of all work done shall be assessed on the remaining lots or parcels of land lying within the limits of the assessment district, without regard to such omitted lots or parcels of land.



######### 5302.5.  
If the legislative body, in the resolution of intention, declares that any lot or parcel of land owned and used as provided in Section 5301 shall be included in the assessment, or if no declaration is made respecting any such lot or parcel of land then any assessment upon such lot or parcel of land shall be an enforceable obligation against the owner of such property and shall be paid, within 30 days after the date of recording the assessment, by the officer, officers, or board having charge of the disbursement of the funds of the owner of such lot or parcel of land and, if not paid within said 30 days, shall bear interest until paid at the rate stated in the resolution of intention for the bonds proposed to be issued, and if no bonds are proposed to be issued then at the rate of not more than 7 percent per annum until paid; provided, however, that if said assessment is not paid within said 30-day period the city may, and if the city has so provided in its resolution of intention shall, at the expiration thereof, forthwith advance the necessary sum and pay the assessment and shall collect the amount of said assessment and interest thereon from the said obligated owner and may enforce the collection thereof by writ of mandate or other proper remedy.  If for any reason there are not moneys available for the payment of said assessment, then the legislative body of the public entity which owns said property so assessed may elect to cause said assessment to be payable in a number of installments not to exceed the number of installments of and at the same interest rate as bonds issued in the proceedings creating the assessment, or if no bonds are to be issued, for a number of installments not to exceed the number of installments of annual payments as provided by Section 6462 of this code for payment of bonds issued under the provisions of this division and for a rate of interest to be specified.  In the event the legislative body of the entity whose property is assessed decides that said assessment shall be payable in installments, then the officer, officers or board whose duty it is to levy taxes for said obligated owner, including school districts but not limited thereto, shall include in the next tax levy an amount, in addition to moneys for all other purposes, sufficient to pay the annual installment of principal and interest upon said assessment with interest on the unpaid principal of the assessment to date of the payments, and shall include in each succeeding tax levy a like amount or more, in addition to moneys for all other purposes, until the principal of said assessment and all interest on unpaid portions thereof, shall be paid in full. In the event the officer, officers, or board whose duty it is to levy taxes fails to discharge the principal of the assessment and the interest thereon, the owner of the assessment may compel the levy thereof in the manner hereinabove set forth by writ of mandate.  No statute of limitations shall bar any right provided for herein to enforce the collection of an assessment of the type described herein and any interest due thereon until four years after the due date of the last principal payment due upon said assessment.  The owner of an assessment described herein may use mandamus or other appropriate remedy to compel the officer, officers or board whose duty it is to levy taxes for said obligated owner to levy an amount in a given year equal to the amount necessary to pay the installment of principal and interest on the assessment in said year, and may continue to use mandamus or other remedy to cause like installments of the amount of principal and interest accruing to be levied each year until the whole of the assessment due has been paid.

If the owner of an assessment is successful in any action to compel the levy of a tax under this section he shall be awarded reasonable attorneys’ fees as fixed by the court and costs and said attorneys’ fees and costs shall be included in said tax levy.



######### 5302.6.  
As an alternative method to that method provided in Sections 5302.5 and 6467, for financing unpaid assessments against publicly owned property, as such property is defined in Section 5301, bonds may be issued to represent unpaid assessments against such public property. Bonds shall be issued in the manner and form as provided for in Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 6468), Part 5 of this division. The holders of such bonds and each individual holder of such bonds shall have all of the rights set forth for the holder of an assessment under Section 5302.5 and that of the owner of a certificate to represent assessment against public property as provided for in this code and other rights as provided by the provisions of Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 6468), Part 5 of this division. If bonds are to be issued to represent assessments against publicly owned property, it may be set forth by resolution of the legislative body of the entity conducting the proceedings at any time prior to the levy of assessment in the proceedings.



######### 5303.  
If the legislative body, in the resolution of intention, declares that any lot or parcel of land used as provided in Section 5301 and owned by the United States or any department thereof or the State of California or any department thereof shall be included in the assessment, then the city shall be liable for such sum as may thereafter be assessed against such lot or parcel of land and which is unpaid after 30 days from the recordation of the assessment.  Such sum shall be payable by the city out of the general fund unless the legislative body shall in its resolution of intention designate another fund.  The foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply to any assessment pursuant to Chapter 14 (commencing with Section 5320) of Part 3 of this division against any such land owned by the State of California or department thereof, but the city shall advance the amount of any such assessment in such assessment proceedings and shall in such case become the owner of such assessment and entitled to repayment of such amount with interest thereon at the rate provided in that chapter from the State of California or any department thereof.



######### 5305.  
The legislative body may provide for deferral of payment of assessments in accordance with procedures prescribed by Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 10700) of Division 12.








##### CHAPTER 14. Assessment of Property Owned by the State of California [5320 - 5325]  

######### 5320.  
Notwithstanding the terms and provisions of any other section of this division, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to and govern the assessment of property owned by the State of California or any department thereof.



######### 5321.  
All real property acquired by the State of California or any department thereof is property subject to assessment in proceedings conducted under this division, except real property which is acquired prior to the filing in the office of the county recorder of a copy of the map of the assessment district pursuant to Section 3111 and which is located within the right-of-way of a state highway or proposed state highway. For the purposes of this section, property shall be deemed to have been acquired upon the vesting of title, or the filing of a condemnation action, whichever occurs first. The local agency shall notify the Department of Transportation of any proceedings or hearings to be held relative to the establishment of a map of the assessment district pursuant to Section 3111.



######### 5322.  
The State of California or any department thereof that has jurisdiction over any real property subject to assessment as provided in this chapter shall pay the amount of money assessed against such real property together with any interest as herein provided. If the State of California or the department thereof having jurisdiction of the real property does not pay the amount of money so assessed against such property on or before the end of the second fiscal year following the date when the notice of assessment is recorded pursuant to Section 3114, the owner of such assessment shall, within six months after the end of the second fiscal year, have the right to file a claim against the State of California in the manner provided in Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 900) and Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 910) of Part 3 of Division 3.6 of Title 1 of the Government Code, and neither any provision of those chapters nor any statute of limitation nor any other statutory provision shall bar the filing of such a claim within such six-months’ period.



######### 5323.  
The State of California or any department thereof having jurisdiction over any real property subject to assessment as provided in this chapter shall have the same right provided for in this division or other applicable law to pay the amount of money assessed against such real property without interest as does a private person owning property assessed under this division or such other law.



######### 5324.  
Neither the State of California nor any department thereof that has jurisdiction over any real property assessed, as herein provided, shall be obligated to make payment thereof until the Legislature has appropriated the amount necessary to make payment of such assessment.



######### 5325.  
If the State of California or such department thereof does not pay the amount of money assessed within 30 days after the effective date of the legislation making the appropriation to pay the assessment, the amount of money assessed shall bear interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum until paid, commencing with the 31st day after the effective date of such appropriation.








##### CHAPTER 14.5. Assessments of Indian-Owned Property [5330 - 5335]  

######### 5330.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to, and govern the assessment of, Indian-owned property.



######### 5331.  
As used in this chapter, “Indian-owned property” means any tax exempt trust property to which an American Indian has rights as determined by federal laws, as administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of Interior.



######### 5332.  
Whenever Indian-owned property is leased, and a possessory interest is created thereby, the leasehold interest may be subject to assessment in proceedings conducted under this division. In such instances, the city shall first obtain the written consent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the owner of the underlying fee, and any owner of an existing prior recorded possessory interest in the property.



######### 5333.  
Any such assessment shall be secured by an assignment to the city of the possessory interest which shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the real property is located.



######### 5334.  
When bonds are to be issued to represent unpaid assessments against a possessory interest created by a lease in Indian-owned property, the term of the lease remaining at the time of issuance shall exceed, by at least 15 years, the term of the bonds issued.

If bonds are to be issued to represent assessments against such a possessory interest, the legislative body shall so declare in the resolution of intention.  



######### 5335.  
All notices required by this division to be given to the owner of property subject to an assessment, shall be given to the fee owner, the owner of an existing prior recorded possessory interest, and the assignor of the possessory interest created by a lease. The notices shall refer to the possessory interest against which the assessment is made.

Where the provisions of this division otherwise require any notice or documents to refer to the property subject to assessment, the notice or document shall refer instead to the possessory interest and shall contain a legal description of the possessory interest created by the lease on such property.  If the legal description of the possessory interest describes an area less than the entire property ownership, the notice or document shall also contain a reference to the record of the acquisition instrument to the entire parcel from which the possessory interest was created.








##### CHAPTER 15. District Assessments [5341 - 5344]  

######### 5341.  
The engineer shall prior to completion of the contract make a diagram of the property affected or benefited by the proposed work, as described in the resolution of intention, which is to be assessed to pay the costs and expenses thereof.



######### 5342.  
The diagram shall show each separate lot or parcel of land within the limits of the assessment district, and the dimensions of each such lot or parcel of land, and the relative location of the same to the work proposed to be done.



######### 5343.  
Immediately after its completion the diagram shall be delivered to the superintendent of streets, who shall immediately, after the contractor has fulfilled his contract to the satisfaction of the superintendent of streets or the legislative body, on appeal, proceed to estimate upon the lots or parcels of land within the assessment district, as shown by the diagram, the benefits arising from such work, and to be received by each such lot or parcel of land. He shall thereupon assess upon and against the lands in the assessment district the total amount of the costs and expenses of such work, and in so doing shall assess the total sum upon the several lots or parcels of land in the assessment district, benefited thereby, in proportion to the estimated benefits to be received by each of the said several lots or parcels of land.



######### 5344.  
In other respects the assessment shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 16.








##### CHAPTER 16. Making and Confirming the Assessment [5360 - 5375.1]  

######### 5360.  
After the contractor has fulfilled his contract to the satisfaction of the street superintendent, or the engineer if such power has been delegated to him, the superintendent or engineer, as the case may be, shall forthwith make an assessment to cover the sum due for the work performed and specified in the contract, including all incidental expenses, in conformity with the provisions of this part according to the character of the work done, and in the event an acquisition is included in the proceeding, including the amount then estimated by the street superintendent or engineer as the case may be, as the cost of the acquisition.



######### 5360.2.  
The street superintendent in making an assessment shall deduct from the total costs and expenses of the work any contributions authorized to be paid pursuant to Chapter 2.5 (commencing at Section 5125) of Part 3.



######### 5360.3.  
In assessing land, credit may be given for dedications and for improvements constructed at private expense.



######### 5361.  
The assessment shall briefly refer to the contract, the work contracted for and performed, and shall show the amount to be paid therefor, together with all incidental expenses, the amount of each assessment against each lot or portion of a lot, the number of each lot or portion or portions of a lot so assessed, the additional information required by subdivision (b) of Section 53753 of the Government Code, and shall have attached thereto a diagram exhibiting each street or street crossing, place, property or rights of way on which any work has been done, showing the relative location of each lot or portion of lot to the work done, numbered to correspond with the numbers of the assessments.



######### 5362.  
The assessment shall be filed with the clerk. The clerk shall give notice of the filing of the assessment and of a time to be therein fixed by the clerk when all persons interested in the work done or in the assessment will be heard by the legislative body. The notice shall be posted and in addition be published. The first publication shall be not less than 15 days before the time fixed for the hearing.



######### 5363.  
Such notice shall also be given by mail.



######### 5364.  
Such notice shall designate the property within the assessment district belonging to the owner by street number, or some other description sufficient to enable the property owner to identify the property, include a statement of the amount proposed to be assessed against such property, and state the name and telephone number of a local department or agency designated by the legislative body to answer inquiries regarding the making of an appeal pursuant to Section 5366.



######### 5365.  
Reference shall be made in the notices required by this chapter to the resolution of intention and the date of its passage for a description of the work therein mentioned and no other description thereof shall be necessary.



######### 5366.  
The owners, the contractor, or his assigns, and all other persons interested in any work done under this division, or in the assessment, feeling aggrieved by any act or determination of the superintendent of streets or engineer in relation thereto, or who claim that the work has not been performed according to the contract in a good and substantial manner or who claim that any portion of the work for any reason was omitted or illegally included in the contract or having or making any objection to the correctness of the assessment or diagram or other act, determination or proceedings of the superintendent of streets or engineer, shall prior to the day fixed for the hearing upon the assessment appeal to the legislative body by briefly stating in writing the grounds of appeal. Any objection, appeal or protest not made at the time and in the manner hereinabove provided shall be deemed to be waived voluntarily by any person who might have made such appeal, protest or objection, and such person shall be deemed to have consented to the proposed assessment and any other matter on which objection, protest or appeal could be made.



######### 5367.  
Upon such appeal, the legislative body may remedy and correct any error or informality in the proceedings, and revise and correct any of the acts or determinations of the street superintendent or engineer relative to said work; may confirm, amend, alter, modify or correct the assessment or diagram in such manner as to it shall seem just, and require the work to be completed according to the directions of the legislative body; and may instruct and direct the street superintendent to correct the warrant, assessment, or diagram in any particular.



######### 5368.  
All the decisions and determinations of the legislative body, upon notice and hearing as aforesaid, shall be final and conclusive upon all persons entitled to appeal to the legislative body, as to all errors, informalities, and irregularities which the legislative body might have avoided, or have remedied during the progress of the proceedings or which it can at that time remedy.



######### 5369.  
No assessment, warrant, or diagram, and no proceedings prior to the assessment, shall be held invalid by any court for any error, informality, or other defect in the same, where the resolution of intention of the legislative body to do the work, has been actually published as provided in this division. When no appeal is taken or when the orders and determinations of the legislative body upon appeal have been complied with, and the legislative body is satisfied with the correctness of the assessment, the legislative body shall forthwith confirm the proceedings and the assessment and the street superintendent shall attach thereto a warrant bearing the date of such confirmation.



######### 5370.  
Whenever the resolution of intention declares that a contribution of labor or of labor and any portion of materials, supplies or equipment for the proposed work will be made by any local, State or National agency or authority, an assessment shall be made to cover the sum due for furnishing the materials, supplies or equipment as specified in the contract including all incidental expenses. In all other particulars the assessment shall be made in conformity with this part relating to district assessments. However, if all of the work described in the resolution of intention is not completed because the agency or authority ceases to furnish the labor provided for in the resolution of intention, for a period of 90 days, the street superintendent shall notify the legislative body of such cessation in writing. The legislative body may by resolution declare the contract terminated and order the superintendent of streets to make the assessment to cover the portions of work completed and incidental expenses incurred, in accordance with the benefits to be received by each of the several lots or parcels of land in the district, pursuant to the provisions of this part relating to district assessments.



######### 5371.  
To the assessment shall be attached a warrant, which shall be signed by the superintendent of streets, and countersigned by the mayor or the city clerk. The warrant shall be substantially in the following form:

By virtue hereof, I (name of the superintendent of streets), of the City of ______, County of ______ (or County or City and County of ______), State of California, by virtue of the authority vested in me as said superintendent of streets, do authorize and empower (name of contractor) (his or their) agents or assigns, to demand and receive, the several assessments upon the assessment and diagram hereto attached and this shall be (his or their) warrant for the same.


|
Date: _____ 
|
|
(Name of superintendent of streets)
|
|
Countersigned by (name of mayor or city clerk).
|


######### 5372.  
The warrant, diagram and assessment shall be recorded in the office of the superintendent of streets and in accordance with Section 5372.1 and may be recorded at any hour of the calendar day. Immediately thereafter the clerk shall record a notice of assessment, as provided for in Section 3114, whereupon, as provided in Section 3115, said assessment shall attach as a lien upon the property assessed.



######### 5372.1.  
No assessment or bond hereafter levied or issued shall become a lien and no person shall be deemed to have notice thereof until a certified copy of the assessment and the diagram attached thereto shall be recorded in the office of the county surveyor if the improvement district or any part thereof is in unincorporated territory and with the superintendent of streets of the city or cities if the improvement district or any part thereof is in incorporated territory.



######### 5372.5.  
Upon the confirmation of the assessment by the legislative body, the clerk shall furnish the superintendent of streets with a list containing each assessment or parcel number, as shown on said recorded assessment, and the name and address of the owner or owners of the real property represented by each such number, as shown on the last equalized assessment roll or as on file in the office of the clerk. Such list shall be delivered to the contractor, or his agent or assigns, at the same time and under the same conditions as the delivery of the warrant, assessment and diagram, pursuant to Section 5374.



######### 5373.  
The lien, whether bonds issued to represent the assessment or otherwise, shall be subordinate to all fixed special assessment liens previously imposed upon the same property, but it shall have priority over all fixed special assessment liens which may thereafter be created against the property; and from and after the date of the recording of any warrant, assessment and diagram, all persons shall be deemed to have notice of the contents thereof.

The holder of a subordinate assessment or a bond representing a subordinate assessment shall have the rights of an inferior lienholder as provided in Section 2904 of the Civil Code.



######### 5374.  
The lien of a reassessment and a refunding assessment shall have the same priority as the original assessment to which it relates. A supplemental assessment is a new assessment.



######### 5374.1.  
The amount of any contribution for the cost and expenses of the work shall be paid by the city to the contractor, or his agent, or assigns, upon delivery of the warrant, assessment and diagram, or prior to said delivery, may be paid in installments, for work completed, during the progress of the work. Notice that there will be progress payments must appear in the invitation for bids.



######### 5375.  
After the warrant, assessment and diagram are recorded, the same shall be delivered to the contractor, or his agent or assigns, on demand, but not until after the payment to the superintendent of streets of the incidental expenses not previously paid by the contractor, his agent or his assigns, including the amount by which the amount included in the assessment as the cost of any acquisition exceeds the amount previously demanded of the contractor therefor, but with proper credit to the contractor in the event there was included in the assessment as the cost of any acquisition, an amount less than the amount demanded of the contractor therefor at the time of the execution of the contract pursuant to Section 5256; provided, however, that when the superintendent of streets has, by ordinance, been authorized and directed to receive payments pursuant to Section 5396 of this division said warrant shall not be delivered to said contractor or assigns nor shall such contractor or assigns be entitled to receive payment of assessments by virtue of said warrant within 30 days from the recordation of said warrant.



######### 5375.1.  
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5375 the legislative body may waive the requirement that the contractor, or his agent, or assigns pay the expenses incidental to the cost of the work, or work and acquisition paid for by contribution.








##### CHAPTER 17. Demanding Payment of the Assessment [5390 - 5397]  

######### 5390.  
The warrant, after its delivery to the contractor or his assigns, shall be and constitute full authority to the contractor, his agents or assigns, to collect the assessments.

At least 30 days prior to filing the written statement of all payments received upon the assessment, the contractor, his agents or assigns, shall mail a statement to each owner of real property within the assessment district as shown on the list delivered pursuant to Section 5372.5.  The statement shall specify a last date for payment of the assessment, which shall be not less than 30 days from the date of mailing.  The statements shall contain a designation of property assessed by the assessment or parcel number shown on the recorded assessment, by street number, or some other description sufficient to enable the property owner to identify the property, a statement of the amount of the assessment, and the place of payment, the effect of failure to pay within such time and that, if bonds are to be issued, a statement of that fact, designating the provisions of law pursuant to which the bonds are to be issued.  Upon completion of the mailing of the statements, the contractor or his assigns shall file with the superintendent of streets an affidavit setting forth the date and manner of compliance with the requirements of this section.

On or before the last date for payment specified in the notice, assessments may be paid in whole or in part.  No payments shall be received upon the assessment by the contractor, or his agents or assigns, without delivering receipts therefor.



######### 5391.  
After 30 days after the date of mailing by the contractor or his assigns of the statement to the property owners pursuant to Section 5390, the contractor, or his assigns, shall sign and file in the office of the superintendent of streets a written statement of all payments received upon the assessment. Thereupon, the superintendent of streets shall file the statement so made with the record of the warrant and assessment by attaching it in the assessment book immediately following the record of the assessment. If under the proceedings being taken bonds are to be issued to represent unpaid assessments, no further payments of assessments can be accepted by the contractor or his assigns after filing said statement, as to any assessment which is to be represented by a bond. When payments are made to the superintendent of streets pursuant to Section 5396 of this division, it shall not be necessary for the contractor or his assigns to file said written statement of payments received.



######### 5392.  
The superintendent of streets shall, at any time, receive the amount due upon any assessment and warrant heretofore or hereafter issued by him and give a good and sufficient discharge therefor, except that after the last date for payment of assessments, as specified in the statement provided by Section 5390, the superintendent of streets shall not receive any amount due upon any unpaid assessments for which the legislative body has provided for the issuance of bonds to represent said unpaid assessments. The legislative body may prescribe by ordinance that the duties imposed by this section on the superintendent of streets shall be performed only by the treasurer.



######### 5393.  
When suit has been brought to collect the amount due upon any assessment, the plaintiff shall file with the superintendent of streets a written notice of the pendency of the action showing the particular assessments affected by the action. After the filing of the notice, the superintendent of streets shall not receive any money on account of the assessment, and he shall have no authority to cancel the assessment or give any discharge thereof without the written consent of the owner of the assessment until judgment has been rendered in the action or the same has been dismissed and the street superintendent shall omit from the list of properties provided to be sent to the tax collector, any property upon which the assessment described in the notice is a lien.



######### 5394.  
If any warrant is lost, upon proof of such loss a duplicate can be issued upon which collections may be made with the same effect as on the original.



######### 5395.  
After the filing of the written statement of all payments received upon the assessment, all amounts remaining due on any assessment, except those assessments for which bonds have been issued or are to be issued, shall draw interest at the rate of 1 percent per month until paid, the interest to be computed from the 31st day after the recordation of the warrant.



######### 5396.  
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this division, the legislative body may, by ordinance, provide that all payments made upon any assessment and warrant within 30 days from the recordation thereof, shall be made to the superintendent of streets, who shall mail a statement to each owner of real property within the assessment district whose name appears on the last equalized assessment roll, at the address appearing on said roll or on file in the office of the clerk, or to both such addresses, if they are not the same. The statement shall contain a designation of the property assessed by street number, or some other description sufficient to enable the property owner to identify the property, statement of the amount of the assessment, and the time and place of payment, the effect of failure to pay within such time and that, if bonds are to be issued, a statement of that fact, designating the provisions of law pursuant to which such bonds are to be issued.

The legislative body may further provide by said ordinance that the superintendent of streets shall receive partial payments upon any assessment and that notice thereof be given to property owners by the statement.



######### 5397.  
If the superintendent of streets is authorized by ordinance to collect the assessments, the ordinance shall also provide that the superintendent of streets shall furnish to the contractor or his assigns a good and sufficient surety bond conditioned upon the full and prompt payment by the superintendent of streets to the contractor or his assigns of all assessments so collected by him. The bond shall be in an amount not less than 10 percent of the total amount of the assessment shown on the assessment roll if such total amount does not exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) and shall be in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) if the total amount of the assessments shown on the assessment roll exceeds the sum of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000). The premium on the bond shall be payable as a part of the incidental expenses of the proceeding.

As an alternative the legislative body, in its discretion, may provide in such ordinance that a blanket surety bond shall be maintained on file in the office of the city clerk, conditioned as above, in amounts herein provided. Such blanket bond shall cover and protect all contractors and their assigns holding warrants for assessments which the superintendent of streets is authorized to collect.  The premium on such blanket bond may be prorated to the several special assessment proceedings as a part of the incidental expenses of such proceedings.

As a further alternative, the legislative body, in its discretion, may provide in such ordinance that the official bond of the superintendent of streets shall guarantee the full and prompt payment by the superintendent of streets to the contractor or his assigns of all assessments collected by him.








##### CHAPTER 18. Collecting the Assessment by Action [5410 - 5423]  

######### 5410.  
The provisions of this chapter shall not be applicable to assessments represented by the issuance of bonds nor to assessments collected on the tax rolls but shall be applicable only to other cash assessments levied pursuant to this division.



######### 5411.  
At any time after the first day of July next succeeding nine months following the date of recording the assessment, the contractor or his assignee may sue in his own name the owner of the land, lots or portions of lots assessed on the day of the date of the recording of the warrant, assessment and diagram, and recover the amount of any assessment remaining unpaid together with interest and any penalties allowed under this chapter. If any State, county or municipal taxes or any other special assessment is delinquent on the property the action may be brought at any time after 90 days after the recording of the assessment.



######### 5412.  
When an action has been brought for the recovery of any assessments, the plaintiff shall be entitled to have and recover attorney fees on each assessment sued on. If the action is settled or a tender made prior to the trial of the action, or if judgment is taken on default, the attorney’s fees shall be five dollars ($5) plus one dollar ($1) additional for each lot or parcel of land included in one action. If the action proceeds to trial the court having jurisdiction of the cause shall fix and allow a reasonable attorney fee, which shall not exceed fifteen dollars ($15) plus one dollar ($1) additional for each lot or parcel of land included in one action. The attorney’s fee in either case shall be in addition to all taxable costs and the plaintiff may have judgment therefor.



######### 5413.  
If the court finds an unnecessary number of actions have been brought, where the parties are identical, it may allow the costs of one action only.



######### 5414.  
An action for the recovery of any assessment may be brought in the superior court within whose jurisdiction the city is, in which the work has been done. If any of the assessments are made against lots, portions of lots, or lands, the service of process in the action may be made in the manner prescribed by law. A single action may be brought under any assessment irrespective of the number of lots assessed where the parties defendant are identical. If separate actions are brought, they may be consolidated by order of the court.



######### 5415.  
The warrant, assessment and diagram, with proof of nonpayment shall be prima facie evidence of the regularity and correctness of the assessment and of the prior proceedings and acts of the superintendent of streets, and the legislative body upon which the warrant, assessment and diagram are based, and prima facie evidence of the right of the plaintiff to recover in the action.



######### 5416.  
The plaintiff in such action may recover the cost of any abstract or report of search of title procured in good faith in order to determine ownership. The search shall be made by a reputable abstractor or title company and the cost shall not exceed five dollars ($5) per lot. The abstract or report of search together with the affidavit of payment shall be filed in the action.



######### 5417.  
In a complaint in any action for the recovery of an assessment it shall be sufficient to allege briefly that the legislative body ordered the work, the performance of the work under the contract, the making of the assessment, the issuing of the warrant and the making of the diagram; that an assessment (naming the amount) was levied against that certain lot or parcel of land (describing it) which, according to the information and belief of the plaintiff, is owned by the defendant; and that payment of the assessment has not been made.



######### 5418.  
In describing a lot or parcel of land in a complaint for the recovery of any assessment it shall be sufficient to refer to the same by its number upon the diagram; provided, a certified copy of the warrant, assessment and diagram shall have been previously filed in the office of the recorder of the county in which the lot or parcel of land is situated. It shall be the duty of the recorder to so file any such certified copy presented to him upon payment of the filing fee.



######### 5419.  
Upon the entry of judgment or dismissal of the action the clerk of the court shall forthwith mail to the street superintendent of the city having jurisdiction over the proceeding in which the assessment was levied, a certified copy of the judgment or other evidence sufficient to advise the street superintendent of the judgment of the court in the action.



######### 5420.  
If the contractor or his agent or any person acting in behalf of the contractor shall, prior to the filing of a complaint for the recovery of any assessment, or subsequent to the filing of the action and prior to the allowance of attorney fees and costs, make any written demand upon or present any bill or notice in writing to the owner, demanding, requesting or notifying such owner to pay or that there is due, attorney’s fees or court costs in connection with the collection of the assessment, then the superintendent of streets is authorized, upon written demand of the owner, accompanied by the affidavit of the owner, that such written demand, bill or notice for the payment of attorney’s fees and costs, or either thereof, was made upon or presented to such owner prior to the commencement of the action, or subsequent to the filing of the action and prior to the allowance of attorney’s fees and costs, together with such written demand, bill or notice to mark said assessment “paid” and such assessment shall thereby be deemed to be paid and the lien thereof released. This section shall not apply to the service of summons and complaint in a civil action.



######### 5421.  
If an action is brought for the recovery of any assessment prior to the time permitted for bringing such action, the plaintiff shall not recover and the defendant shall be entitled to have and recover such attorney’s fees as the court may deem reasonable in addition to all taxable costs and he may have judgment therefor.



######### 5422.  
The court in which an action for the recovery of an assessment is commenced shall have power to adjudge and decree a lien against the premises assessed, and to order such premises to be sold on execution, as in other cases of the sale of real estate by the process of the courts. On appeal, the appellate courts shall be vested with the same power to adjudge and decree a lien and to order such premises to be sold on execution or decree as is conferred on the court from which an appeal is taken.



######### 5423.  
In all actions now pending or hereafter brought under this division to recover street assessments, the proceedings therein shall be governed and regulated by the provisions of this division, and also, when not in conflict herewith, by the laws of this State.








##### CHAPTER 18.1. Collecting the Assessment on the Tax Roll [5450 - 5458]  

######### 5450.  
As an alternative method for the collection of cash assessments or assessments of less than one hundred fifty dollars ($150) levied under the provisions of this division, the legislative body, upon the written request of the contractor or his assigns, shall, by resolution adopted on or before the third Tuesday in September, direct that such assessments be collected upon the tax roll upon which general taxes are collected.



######### 5451.  
Said resolution shall contain a description of the properties so assessed, the amount of such assessments, together with interest thereon from the date of filing the original list of unpaid assessments and at the rate of 1 percent per month to the next succeeding thirty-first day of December of the tax year for which such roll shall have been prepared, and the total amounts of principal and interest on each property.



######### 5452.  
A certified copy of said resolution shall be delivered immediately to the officer designated by law to extend city taxes upon the tax roll on which they are collected.



######### 5453.  
Said officer shall extend upon such roll the total amounts of such assessments and interest.



######### 5454.  
Said amounts shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner, as general municipal taxes are collected, and be subject to the same penalties and interest, and to the same procedure under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency, as provided for general municipal taxes, all of which laws for the levy, enforcement and collection of which are hereby made applicable to such special assessment taxes.



######### 5455.  
Said assessments and the interest so entered shall become due and payable to the contractor or his assigns at the office of the city treasurer on the second day of January next succeeding.



######### 5456.  
Upon default in payment, the lands so assessed shall be sold in the same manner in which real property in such city is sold for the nonpayment of general municipal taxes, and be subject to redemption within one year from the date of sale in the same manner as such real property is redeemed from such delinquent sale, and upon failure of such redemption, shall in like manner be sold or pass by deed to the city. The city shall not, however, be required to pay into the assessment fund any part of such delinquency until such property be redeemed or sold and money received therefor.



######### 5457.  
Upon receipt of such deed the city shall thereupon offer and sell such property at public auction in the manner provided by law for the sale of its tax-deeded property, and the amount of said assessment and the penalties and interest thereon shall be paid to said contractor or his assigns.



######### 5458.  
In the event there shall have been no bidder offering the amount then due on such property, it may, at the city’s election, be declared sold to the owner of such assessment, and in like manner be deeded to him, and such assessment ordered satisfied of record.








##### CHAPTER 19. Reassessments [5500 - 5511]  

######### 5500.  
If any assessment heretofore or hereafter made, issued or filed in the office of the clerk is void or unenforceable for any cause or if bonds have been or are issued to represent or be secured by any assessments and such issuance was or is not effective through the curative provisions in relation thereto, or any curative act that may be passed by the Legislature in relation thereto to make them valid and enforceable, then, in any of such events a reassessment therefor may be issued. A reassessment may be made upon the initiative of the legislative body.



######### 5501.  
The true intent and meaning of this chapter is to make the cost and expense of any work made through an attempted compliance with this division payable by the real estate benefited by such work by making a reassessment therefor.

Such power of reassessing embraces both a full and partial reassessment, and is not exhausted by a single attempted exercise thereof.



######### 5502.  
A reassessment shall be ordered under any one of the following circumstances:

(a) Whenever the owner or holder of any assessments, or bonds issued under this division to represent or be secured by assessments, or the person who would own or hold any such assessment or bonds if they were issued, requests the legislative body to order a reassessment.  In such event if the legislative body is of the opinion that the assessments or bonds in question are not enforceable, it shall order the making and issuing of a reassessment covering only the assessments owned or held by the petitioner, or the assessments represented or secured by the bonds owned or held by such petitioner, or which would be owned or held by petitioner if issued.

(b) Whenever any court of competent jurisdiction in any action to foreclose the lien of any assessment or to enforce the obligation of any bond issued to represent or be secured by any assessments issued under this division for any reason holds such lien unenforceable, then it shall in and by its decree direct the making of a reassessment to cover the assessments involved in such action.

(c) Whenever any court of competent jurisdiction in any action to set aside the lien of any assessment or of any bond representing any assessment or in any action to quiet title against the lien of any such assessment, or bond, or in any action to enjoin the making, filing, confirmation or issuance of any assessment or bond to pay for the cost and expenses of any work done under this division, in its judgment decrees such assessments or bonds to be void or unenforceable, or enjoins the making, filing or issuance or confirmation of any such assessment or bond, then it shall in and by its decree direct the making of a reassessment to cover the assessments involved in such action.

(d) Whenever any contractor or assignee of a contractor has done or performed any work pursuant to proceedings had and taken in attempted compliance with this division, and whenever prior to the issuance of any assessment, any court of competent jurisdiction in any action to invalidate the contract or any of such proceedings for any reason declares the contract or other proceedings to be invalid, then such court shall in and by its decree direct the making of a reassessment for the reasonable value of the work actually done and performed in good faith by the contractor, or such portion thereof as was of a kind that could lawfully have been ordered under the provisions of this division.



######### 5503.  
The superintendent of streets shall, upon the entering of a decree of court directing a reassessment or upon the making of an order by the legislative body directing a reassessment, proceed to make a reassessment in the following manner:

(a) If the reassessment is a partial one only, then it shall not be necessary for the diagram to show any other lots than the ones covered by such partial reassessment.

(b) If it is a full reassessment, the superintendent of streets shall prepare and file with the reassessment a diagram showing the lots or parcels of land deemed by him to have been benefited by the work.  The reassessment shall assess upon and against each of the lots or parcels of land contained therein an amount arrived at as follows:

The benefits derived, or to be derived, by each of the lots or parcels of land from the work estimated as of the date of the filing in the clerk’s office of the original assessment shall first be listed.  Then there shall be added thereto interest thereon from 30 days after the date of such filing of the original assessment at the rate of 7 percent per annum, and the total sum shall constitute and be the amount of the proposed several assessments in such reassessment.  The total of such reassessment, however, exclusive of interest, shall not exceed the cost and expenses of the work.

In the event such reassessment is not confirmed within seven months of the date of filing in the clerk’s office of the original assessment, the legislative body shall pay from its general funds the 7 percent interest added to the cost and expenses of the work in accordance with this section, plus the incidental expenses of such reassessment in the event that a reassessment is made.



######### 5504.  
The reassessment need not be in any prescribed form, but shall refer to the original assessment filed, give the date of filing of the original assessment and state that it is made pursuant to the order of the legislative body or decree of the court, as the case may be, and shall be accompanied by a diagram showing the lots or parcels of land to be reassessed and their relation to the work.



######### 5505.  
The reassessment shall then be presented to the legislative body, which shall fix a time for hearing before it. Such time must be at least 20 days after the reassessment is so presented. The clerk shall then advertise the time of such hearing before the legislative body by publishing a notice in the newspaper in which the notice of award of contract for the work for which the assessment was made was published, unless the legislative body directs publication in some other paper.



######### 5505.1.  
The clerk shall give notice of the presentation of the reassessment and the hearing thereon by mail, as provided in Sections 5070 and 5364, and by posting, as provided in Section 5065.



######### 5506.  
The notice shall describe the district by:

(a) Stating its exterior boundaries; or

(b) Giving a description thereof by any official or recorded map; or

(c) Referring to the reassessment diagram.Such notice shall be published pursuant to Section 6062a of the Government Code.



######### 5507.  
At the time fixed for the hearing, or at such time or times to which the hearing may be thereafter adjourned, the legislative body shall consider the objections to the reassessment and in its discretion informally direct the revision, correction or modification of such reassessment in such manner as is most equitable to apportion to each lot or parcel of land thereby benefited the amount of the actual benefits derived from the work. When the reassessment is revised, or corrected or modified so as to comply with the judgment of the legislative body, then it shall pass a resolution confirming the reassessment.



######### 5508.  
The street superintendent shall thereupon record the reassessment with a certificate at the end thereof by the clerk, that it is the reassessment approved by the legislative body. He shall also note opposite the several assessments in the original assessment that have been displaced by the reassessment the fact that the reassessment has been made, giving its date, and shall credit upon such reassessment all payments theretofore made upon the original assessment, or upon the bonds issued to represent the original assessment, together with interest on such payments at the rate of 7 per cent per year from and after the date of such payments.



######### 5509.  
The reassessment shall be collectible and payable in the same manner as an original assessment and shall be enforceable by action in the same manner provided in this division for enforcing an original assessment, and shall have the same weight in evidence. If bonds issued under or upon the security of the original assessment they shall also issue upon the reassessment for such sum as may be reassessed against the lots or parcels of land covered thereby.



######### 5510.  
When the reassessment is recorded the original assessment shall be canceled by the street superintendent so far as it affects the particular assessments involved. New bonds shall not be issued until the original bonds are delivered up to the treasurer, who shall cancel them. The lien of the reassessment shall hold its relative rank as to other special assessment liens as of the date of filing of the original assessment.



######### 5510.1.  
The expense of any county treasurer in issuing any new bonds and in carrying out any reassessment shall be paid by the city conducting the assessment proceedings.



######### 5511.  
If work done in attempted compliance with this division is fully completed to the satisfaction of the street superintendent or engineer, as the case may be, it shall nevertheless be the duty of the proper officer to make and file an assessment for the costs and expenses thereof, which shall form the basis of a reassessment if the assessment is unenforceable.








##### CHAPTER 19.1. Supplemental Assessment [5520 - 5525]  

######### 5520.  
In the event that the proceedings include an acquisition and it is ascertained after the filing of the original assessment, that the acquisition cost exceeds the acquisition cost as set forth in the original assessment, the legislative body may pay this deficit out of the general fund, or may order a supplemental assessment to pay the deficit.



######### 5521.  
The supplemental assessment shall be made and collected, and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner, as nearly as may be, as in the case of the original assessment. The superintendent of streets shall prepare and file with the supplemental assessment, a diagram showing the lots or parcels of land deemed by him to have been benefited by the acquisition. The superintendent of streets shall assess upon the said several lots or parcels of land shown in said diagram, the additional acquisition cost, in proportion to the estimated benefits to be received by each of said several lots or parcels of land.



######### 5522.  
Sections 5366, 5367, 5368, 5369, and 5372 apply to the supplemental assessment except that the objections, appeals, or protests referred to in Section 5366 are limited to the matter of the acquisition and not to the work or improvement.



######### 5523.  
At the time of ordering a supplemental assessment, the legislative body shall have the power to determine that bonds shall be issued to represent unpaid assessments of fifty dollars ($50) or more.



######### 5524.  
The lien of a supplemental assessment, whether bonds issue to represent the supplemental assessment or otherwise, shall be subordinate to all special assessment liens previously imposed upon the said property, but it shall have priority over all special assessment liens which may thereafter be created against the property; and from and after the date of the recording of any warrant, special assessment and diagram, all persons shall be deemed to have notice of the contents thereof.



######### 5525.  
The city shall have the power to sell the supplemental assessment and any bonds issued to represent the unpaid supplemental assessments (if the legislative body orders the issuance of said bonds) in such manner as the legislative body directs; provided, however, that the interest rate on the bonds (if ordered to be issued) shall not exceed 6 percent per year. The city shall also have the power to hold said unpaid supplemental assessments or bonds, and enforce the lien thereof, in the same manner as a private owner. Said supplemental assessments, bonds or the proceeds of the sale thereof may be used for the repayment of advances theretofore made by the city in the matter of the acquisition.








##### CHAPTER 19.2. Additional Assessment [5530 - 5533]  

######### 5530.  
In the event that the cost and expense of the improvement work payable by the real estate benefited by such work exceeds the construction costs set forth in the contract, because of an act or omission of the legislative body or its superintendent of streets, officers, or employees occurring prior to the award of the contract which subjects the legislative body to liability pursuant to Division 3.6 (commencing with Section 810), Title 1 of the Government Code, the legislative body may settle this liability out of court, or may pay a judgment rendered by the court as to this liability, by a payment out of the General Fund or by an additional assessment.



######### 5531.  
In the event payment is to be made by an additional assessment, the additional assessment shall be made and collected, and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner, as nearly as may be, as in the case of the original assessment. The superintendent of streets shall prepare and file with the additional assessment, a diagram showing the lots or parcels of land deemed by him to have been benefited by the work. The superintendent of streets shall assess the additional assessment upon the several lots or parcels of land shown in such diagram in the proportion to the estimated benefits to be received by each of the several lots or parcels of land.



######### 5532.  
Sections 5366, 5367, 5368, 5369 and 5372 of this code shall apply to the additional assessment except that the objections, appeals or protests referred to in Section 5366 shall be limited to the matter of the cost of liability and not relate to the work, acquisition or improvement.



######### 5533.  
The lien of an additional assessment, whether bonds issued to represent the additional assessment or otherwise, shall be subordinate to all special assessment liens previously imposed upon the property, but it shall have priority over all special assessment liens which may thereafter be created against the property; and from and after the date of the recording of any warrant, special assessment and diagram, all persons shall be deemed to have notice of the contents thereof.








##### CHAPTER 21. Miscellaneous Assessment Provisions [5580 - 5585.1]  

######### 5580.  
The legislative body, instead of waiting until the completion of the work may, in its discretion, and not otherwise, upon the completion of two blocks or more of any work, order the street superintendent to make an assessment for the proportionate amount of the contract completed, and thereupon proceedings and rights of collection of that assessment shall be the same as provided in this part for the making and collection of other assessments.



######### 5581.  
Any tenant or lessee of the lands or lots liable may pay the amount assessed against the property of which he is the tenant or lessee under the provisions of this division, or he may pay the price agreed on to be paid under the provisions of Section 5580, either before or after an action is brought, together with costs, to the contractor, or his assigns, or he may redeem the property, if sold on execution or decree for the benefit of the owner, within the time prescribed by law, and deduct the amount so paid from the rents due and to become due from him. For any sums so paid beyond the rents due from him, he shall have a lien upon and may retain possession of the land and lots until the amount so paid and advanced is satisfied, with legal interest, from accruing rents, or by payment by the owner.



######### 5584.  
If a county is conducting the proceedings under this division the legislative body may also purchase all or any part of the materials to be used in doing any of the work mentioned in this division and furnish the same therefor. The purchase may be made from such funds of the county as the legislative body may designate.

If the county has a purchasing agent, the materials shall be purchased by him; otherwise the materials shall be purchased by the legislative body by contract let to the lowest responsible bidder after notice calling for bids has been published at least five days in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.  If the county is to furnish materials the resolution of intention shall so provide.  When such provision is made, the execution of the contract for the improvements shall create a liability on the part of the county to furnish the materials provided for in the resolution.



######### 5585.1.  
In the event the city conducting the proceedings designates the county treasurer or tax collector to perform any service relating to collecting or receiving money, including but not limited to, printing, servicing and collecting any bonds, neither the treasurer nor the tax collector so designated shall perform any such service until there shall have been paid to him his estimate of the cost of service or services, provided, however, the city conducting the proceedings, in lieu of the prior payment of the estimated cost, may enter into a written agreement with the county treasurer or tax collector. Such agreement shall provide for the payment of the cost or estimated cost of any service rendered by the designated county officer.

In the event such cost or estimated cost is not included in the assessment, the city conducting the proceedings shall be liable for payment thereof from the general fund.

##### ARTICLE 2. Repairs [5610 - 5618]  

######### 5610.  
The owners of lots or portions of lots fronting on any portion of a public street or place when that street or place is improved or if and when the area between the property line of the adjacent property and the street line is maintained as a park or parking strip, shall maintain any sidewalk in such condition that the sidewalk will not endanger persons or property and maintain it in a condition which will not interfere with the public convenience in the use of those works or areas save and except as to those conditions created or maintained in, upon, along, or in connection with such sidewalk by any person other than the owner, under and by virtue of any permit or right granted to him by law or by the city authorities in charge thereof, and such persons shall be under a like duty in relation thereto.

##### ARTICLE 3. Collection of Cost of Repair [5625 - 5630]  

######### 5625.  
The cost of the repair may be assessed by the legislative body against the parcel of property fronting upon the sidewalk upon which such repair was made, and such cost so assessed, if not paid within five days after its confirmation by the legislative body, shall constitute a special assessment against that parcel of property, and shall be a lien on the property for the amount thereof which lien shall continue until the assessment and all interest thereon is paid, or until it is discharged of record.



######### 5626.  
The superintendent of streets may file in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the parcel of property is located, a certificate substantially in the following form:

# NOTICE OF LIEN


Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Improvement Act of 1911, I did, on the ____ day of ____, 19_, cause the sidewalk, curb, or park or parking strip, bulkheads, retaining walls, or other works (as the case may be) in front of the real property hereinafter described, to be repaired and improved, and the legislative body of said city (county, or city and county) did, on the ____ day of ____, 19_, by Resolution No. ____ assess the cost of such repair upon the real property hereinafter described, and the same has not been paid nor any part thereof, and the said city (county, or city and county), does hereby claim a lien on said real property in the sum of ____ dollars ($____), and the same shall be a lien upon said real property until the said sum, with interest at the rate of ___ percent per annum, from the said ____ day of ____, 19_ (insert date of confirmation of assessment), has been paid in full and discharged of record.

The real property hereinbefore mentioned and upon which a lien is claimed, is that certain piece or parcel of land lying and being in the (name of city, or city and county) the county of ____, State of ____, and particularly described as follows:

######### 5627.  
From and after the date of the recording of the notice of lien, all persons shall be deemed to have had notice of the contents thereof. The notice of lien may include claims against one or more separate parcels of property, whether contiguous or not, together with the amount due, respectively, from each such parcel. The statute of limitation shall not run against the right of the city to enforce the payment of the lien. If any such lien is not paid the city may file and maintain an action to foreclose such lien in the same manner and under the same procedure, so far as applicable, as that under which delinquent bonds are foreclosed under this division.



######### 5628.  
As an alternative method of collection of the amount of the lien, the legislative body, after confirmation of the report of the superintendent of streets, may order the notice of lien to be turned over to the assessor and the tax collector of the city, whereupon it shall be the duty of those officers to add the amount of the assessment to the next regular bill for taxes levied against the lot or parcel of land. If city taxes are collected by the county officials, the notice of lien shall be delivered to the county auditor, who shall enter the amount thereof on the county assessment book opposite the description of the particular property and the amount shall be collected together with all other taxes thereon against the property. The notice of lien shall be delivered to the county auditor before the date fixed by law for the delivery of the assessment book to the county board of equalization.



######### 5628.1.  
The legislative body shall have the power, in its discretion, to determine that the payment of assessments of one hundred dollars ($100) or more may be made in annual installments, not to exceed five, and that the payment of assessments so deferred shall bear interest on the unpaid balance at a rate to be determined by the legislative body, not to exceed the rate permitted for bonds by Section 53531 of the Government Code. Interest shall begin to run on the 31st day after the confirmation of the assessments by the legislative body. Determinations of the legislative body shall be expressed by resolution at any time prior to the confirmation of the assessments.



######### 5629.  
Thereafter the amount of the lien shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary city taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and interest and to the same procedure under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary city taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of city taxes and county taxes are hereby made applicable to such special assessment taxes.



######### 5629.1.  
If bonds are to be issued to represent the security of the unpaid assessments, upon confirmation of the report by the legislative body the superintendent of streets shall give notice to pay by mail and by publication substantially in the manner provided by Sections 4320 and 4321 of this code. The period for payment in cash stated therein shall be 30 days following the date of confirmation of the report. Upon completion of the cash payment period, the superintendent of streets shall file with the county recorder a certificate substantially in the form set out in Section 5626, giving notice therein that interest is payable at a rate to be fixed upon the sale of bonds, which rate shall not exceed the rate permitted for bonds by Section 53531 of the Government Code, and shall begin to run on the 31st day after the confirmation of the report. Thereafter the provisions of Part 5 (commencing with Section 6400) shall be applicable and payments on assessments at bond shall be made as therein provided. The bonds may be issued and sold as the legislative body directs and may be dated at any time after the expiration of the cash payment period.



######### 5630.  
Whenever the property fronting on a sidewalk required to be maintained and repaired pursuant to the provisions of this chapter lies within one city or unincorporated territory of a county, and the sidewalk required to be so maintained and repaired lies within another city or unincorporated territory of a county, the superintendent of streets of the city or county having jurisdiction over the sidewalk shall have full authority to serve notices to repair and do all work contemplated by Articles 2 and 3 of this chapter, notwithstanding the fact that the property fronting on the sidewalk lies within another city or unincorporated territory of a county. The legislative body of the city or county within which the sidewalk has been repaired pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall have jurisdiction to levy an assessment to pay the cost of any such sidewalk repairs against the parcel of property fronting on said sidewalk, notwithstanding the fact that said property lies within another city or unincorporated territory of a county and said assessment shall be a lien on said property for the amount thereof until the assessment and all interest thereon is paid or until it is discharged of record.

The provisions of Sections 5628 and 5629 of this code shall be applicable to the collection and enforcement of all liens levied pursuant to the provisions of this section and the amount so collected shall be paid to the treasurer of the city or county as the case may be which conducted the proceedings.

The board of supervisors may, in its resolution declaring its intention to order work done or improvements made or by separate resolution, declare its intention to order that the expenses of maintaining and operating any or all of said improvements or any or all other improvements such as are permitted to be constructed herein, including the cost of necessary repairs, replacements, fuel, power, electrical current, care, supervision, and any and all other items necessary for the proper maintenance and operation thereof, shall be assessed, either partly or wholly, upon the real property or upon the land only lying within the district to be benefited by and to be assessed to pay the cost of the construction of said improvement, or upon such district as the board of supervisors shall determine will be benefited by the maintenance and operation of the improvements proposed to be maintained; the amounts so assessed to be levied and collected in the same manner and by the same officers as taxes for county purposes are levied and collected.



######### 5821.1.  
The board of supervisors may, in its resolution declaring its intention to order work done or improvements made, declare its intention to order the territory within which the work is to be done or improvements constructed annexed to an existing maintenance district formed under the provisions of this chapter or under the provisions of Chapter 4, Part 3, Division 5, of the Health and Safety Code.

The resolution of intention may describe the territory to be annexed as having the same boundaries as those of the district to be assessed for the cost of constructing the improvements.



######### 5821.2.  
If the board of supervisors in its resolution of intention declares its intention to order the territory within which the improvements are to be constructed annexed to an existing maintenance district, the notice of improvement shall likewise give notice of such declaration of intention and that protests against such annexation may be filed and will be heard in accordance with the provisions of this chapter at the time and place provided for the hearing on the resolution of intention to perform the work.

The board of supervisors shall acquire jurisdiction to order the annexation of such territory to an existing maintenance district by giving notice within the territory proposed to be annexed in the same manner prescribed in this division for the acquiring of jurisdiction to order the construction of improvements, and within the district to which such territory is proposed to be annexed by giving notice as is provided to be given in such district by Section 5838.



######### 5821.3.  
In the event that an ordinance requires the installation of a sewer, drainage, or street lighting system by a subdivider, the resolution of intention may state that the territory owned by the subdivider comes under the terms of such ordinance and order that such territory be formed into a maintenance district, or annexed to an existing maintenance district, without notice and hearing.



######### 5822.  
The resolution of intention shall describe the boundaries of the district which is to be assessed for such maintenance and operation, or if the improvements or any part thereof to be maintained or operated are constructed in the same proceeding, it may describe the maintenance district as having the same boundaries as those of the district to be assessed for the cost of constructing the improvement. In either case the maintenance district may be designated by a name by which it may thereafter be referred to in all subsequent proceedings, including proceedings for the levy and collection of taxes.



######### 5823.  
The maintenance district may include property lying within one or more cities if the consent of the legislative body of each such city to the formation of such district expressed by resolution, is first obtained before the resolution of intention is adopted by the board of supervisors.



######### 5824.  
At any time not later than the hour for hearing objections to the proposed work as provided in this division, or at any time not later than the time fixed in the resolution of intention for the hearing of objections, if the resolution of intention provides for maintenance only, any person permitted by the provisions of this division to make written protest against the proposed work or against the extent of the district to be assessed therefor, or both, may make like protest and in like manner against the ordering of the formation of the maintenance district or against the extent of the maintenance district, or both.



######### 5824.1.  
If the resolution of intention contemplates annexation of the territory within which the improvements are to be constructed to an existing maintenance district, written protests against such annexation or the extent thereof may be filed by any interested person.



######### 5825.  
The board of supervisors, in addition to hearing protests against the proposed work and the extent of the district to be assessed therefor, shall hear and pass upon all protests against the formation of the maintenance district and against the extent thereof, and shall hear and pass upon all protests against the annexation of the territory within which the improvements are to be constructed to an existing maintenance district, and its decision shall be final and conclusive.



######### 5826.  
If the board of supervisors finds that the protest against the formation of the maintenance district is made by the owners of more than one-half of the area of the property included within such district, no further proceedings shall be taken, unless the protests are overruled by an affirmative vote of four-fifths of the members of the board of supervisors, for a period of six months from the date of the decision of the board of supervisors on the hearing. The board of supervisors may adjourn the hearing from time to time.



######### 5827.  
If the board of supervisors, in its resolution of intention, declares its intention to order a maintenance district formed, the notice of improvement shall likewise give notice of such declaration of intention and that protests against such maintenance district may be filed and will be heard in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.



######### 5828.  
The board of supervisors shall acquire jurisdiction to order that the maintenance district be formed in the same manner prescribed in this division for the acquiring of jurisdiction to order the construction of improvements, and it may thereupon by resolution order the formation of such a maintenance district, which order may be contained in the resolution ordering the construction of the work in those cases where such work is provided to be done in the resolution of intention.



######### 5828.1.  
When the board of supervisors adopts a separate resolution declaring its intention to form a maintenance district for sanitary sewers or for street lighting, the clerk shall be directed to give notice of the hearing. The notice shall have the heading “Notice of the proposed formation of ____ Sewer (or Street Lighting) Maintenance District,” stating the name of the proposed district. It shall:

(a) State the time and place for the hearing.

(b) Set forth the exterior boundaries of the territory proposed to be organized into a district.

In lieu of a description, the boundaries of the territory proposed to be included may be shown by means of a diagram printed upon the notice.  The board shall direct the clerk to publish the notice and shall also direct the clerk to post the notice in three public places in the proposed district at least 10 days prior to the date set for the hearing.  The heading of each posted notice shall be in letters not less than one inch in height.  Notice by mail is not required.



######### 5829.  
Upon adoption of the resolution ordering the formation of the maintenance district or the annexation of territory to an existing maintenance district, the legislative body adopting the resolution shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 54900) of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code. Thereafter, the property included within such district shall be segregated on the assessment roll under the designation contained in the resolution.



######### 5829.1.  
Any district may contract with the Federal Government of the United States or any branch thereof, or any county, city and county, municipal corporation, district or other public corporation, or with any person, firm or corporation, for the joint use of any sewer or sewers or other works or facilities for handling, treatment and disposal of sewage or industrial waste from the district and such other area as may be designated in said contract, when in the judgment of the legislative body of said district it is for the best interest of the district so to do. Any such contract may provide for the maintenance and operation of such sewer or sewers, or other works or facilities, and for the payment by or for the parties thereto of such proportionate part of the cost of the maintenance and operation of such sewer or sewers or other works or facilities as may be stated in said contract, the payment to be made at such time and in such amount as may be provided by said contract. Any such contract may provide for the joint use of any sewer or sewers, or works or facilities for the handling, treatment or disposal of sewage or industrial waste upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the parties thereto, and for the flowage, treatment or disposal of sewage or industrial waste from such area for each of the parties thereto as may be described in said contract.

Any district which has acquired or constructed or which proposes to acquire or construct, any sewer or sewers, or works or other facilities for the handling, treatment or disposal of sewage, may contract with the Federal Government of the United States or any branch thereof, or with any county, city and county, municipal corporation, district or other public corporation or with any person, firm or corporation for the use of any such sewer or sewers, works or facilities by any such county, city and county, municipal corporation, district or other public corporation, or for the flowage, treatment or disposal of sewage or industrial waste from any area designated by such person, firm or corporation so contracting, upon such terms and conditions as may be provided in said contract.



######### 5830.  
The board of supervisors shall thereafter, in each year, prior to the time of fixing the county tax rate, estimate the cost of maintaining and operating the improvements to be maintained and operated within the maintenance district during the ensuing year. The board of supervisors shall decide whether or not the cost of maintaining and operating the improvement shall be borne wholly or partially by the maintenance district and shall, in addition to all other taxes, fix a special tax rate for the real property within the maintenance district, or for lighting purposes levy an assessment on each parcel of real property within the maintenance district on the basis of the estimated benefit to the parcel, sufficient to raise an amount of money to cover the expense of maintaining the improvements during the ensuing year, or such portion of the amount as the board of supervisors shall determine shall be borne by the maintenance district, and the board of supervisors shall levy a special assessment tax or, for lighting purposes, an assessment each year upon the real property in the maintenance district sufficient to pay such expense, or the portion thereof, which shall be paid by the maintenance district.



######### 5830.1.  
Whenever the board of supervisors levies an assessment authorized by Section 5830 for purposes of lighting maintenance, the assessment shall be levied pursuant to Chapter 6.1 (commencing with Section 54701) of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code.



######### 5831.  
The special assessment tax shall be levied and collected at the same time and in the same manner as the general tax levy for county purposes and when collected shall be paid into the county treasury to the credit of the fund of the maintenance district and be used for the payment of the expenses of the district. The board of supervisors may control and order the expenditure thereof for such purposes.



######### 5832.  
The board of supervisors may determine that the whole or any part of the expense of such maintenance shall be paid by the county. If the county is to contribute toward the expenses of such maintenance the resolution of intention shall so provide. When such provision is made the execution of the contract for maintenance shall create an obligation in the county to make the contribution provided for in the resolution.



######### 5832.5.  
The board of supervisors may temporarily transfer moneys to the maintenance district fund from other funds in which such moneys are not immediately needed. The money so transferred shall bear interest at a rate to be fixed by the board and shall be used for the purposes provided in this chapter and be retransferred from the maintenance district fund out of the first available receipts.



######### 5832.6.  
If a maintenance district is organized in any year too late for the levy of a special assessment tax or an assessment, as the case may be, in that year or in the next ensuing year, the board of supervisors is hereby authorized to transfer funds of the county not immediately needed for county purposes to the maintenance district fund of the district to be used for the payment of the expenses of the district until such time as special assessment tax or assessment, as the case may be, receipts are available therefor. The board of supervisors shall include in the levy of special assessment taxes or assessments for the district for the first fiscal year in which a tax or an assessment may be levied, a sum sufficient to repay to the county the amounts so transferred to the district for the portion or portions of the preceding fiscal year or years for which no levy of taxes or assessments was made for that purpose and the amounts so transferred shall be retransferred to the county treasury from the maintenance district fund of the district out of the first available receipts from the tax or assessment levy.



######### 5832.7.  
Any area of a maintenance district, or of a temporary zone formed pursuant to Section 5855 in a district, which is included in a city by annexation or incorporation after a loan has been made shall continue to be taxed or assessed for the repayment of its proportionate share of the unpaid balance of the loan.



######### 5832.8.  
(a) The board of supervisors may adopt an ordinance proposing the imposition of a special tax for the purpose of maintaining improvements. Such ordinance shall be submitted to the voters of the maintenance district and shall take effect upon approval of two-thirds of the voters of the district voting on the ordinance.  The approval of the voters may be secured at a district or countywide election, or by a ballot mailed to each registered voter in the district.  The election shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of the Elections Code.  

(b) The ordinance submitted to the voters for approval pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (a) shall specify the terms of the special tax to be imposed which shall include the manner in which the obligation of each taxpayer is determined, when the special tax is to be levied, and the method of collection.  The ordinance may also specify that the special tax imposed by the ordinance may be adjusted annually by the percentage change in the total appropriations subject to limitation of the local government for purposes of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.

(c) Upon approval of the voters under subdivision (a), the board may levy the special tax as authorized by the ordinance, until superseded by a new ordinance adopted pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (a), or until repealed pursuant to an ordinance adopted by the board.

(d) The provisions of this section shall apply only to maintenance districts located wholly within the Town of Portola Valley.



######### 5833.  
The board of supervisors of the county in which a maintenance district is formed shall:

(a) Make and enforce all rules and regulations necessary for the administration, operation and government of such district.

(b) Execute all contracts and make all necessary provisions for the maintenance and operation of the district, except that the board of supervisors may authorize a designated county officer to make, execute and administer contracts for the installing, maintaining and servicing a system of lights in accordance with standards adopted by the board of supervisors and in accordance with this chapter. 

(c) Appoint and employ all necessary agents, superintendents, engineers and labor for the proper performance of the work.

(d) Perform all other acts necessary or proper to accomplish the purposes of this chapter.



######### 5835.  
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the county itself from maintaining and operating any or all of the improvements when ordered by the board of supervisors and from purchasing the materials and supplies and employing the labor necessary for those purposes.



######### 5835.1.  
“Sewers” as used in this chapter includes lateral and collecting sewers, septic tanks, and all other means of handling, gathering, and disposing of sewage in the district.



######### 5835.2.  
“Maintenance of sewers” as used in this chapter includes the extension and enlargement of sewers within the district, and the acquisition or construction of other works or improvements useful in the proper operation of those sewers.



######### 5835.3.  
“Maintenance” as used in this chapter in relation to lighting systems, includes the replacement of any obsolete equipment with new modern equipment found by the board of supervisors or legislative body of a city to be necessary for the proper operation of the district. The replacement of any such obsolete equipment with any such new modern equipment, except for work done by a utility district or a private utility company under contract with the maintenance district, shall be subject to the requirements of Article 56 (commencing with Section 20840) of Chapter 1 of Part 3 of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code.



######### 5835.4.  
The board of supervisors of any lighting maintenance district may provide for the establishment of an accumulative capital outlay fund for the replacement of obsolete lighting system equipment. The fund shall be held in reserve until appropriated in whole or in part to a specific project.

At any time after the creation of the fund, the board may transfer to it any unencumbered surplus funds remaining on hand at the end of the fiscal year after the payment of the expenses of the district.



######### 5835.5.  
Pursuant to a resolution adopted by its board of supervisors, a county may lend any available county funds to a county maintenance district for the replacement of obsolete equipment, or to defray unusual maintenance costs. Any such loan may be restricted for use in a temporary zone formed under the provisions of Section 5855 in a district. The loan shall bear interest at a rate to be fixed by the board of supervisors, and shall be repaid in approximately equal installments over a period not to exceed 10 years. Any funds lent to the district, or zone, are appropriated for the purposes for which the loan was made. Any area of a district, or of a temporary zone in a district, which is included in a city by annexation or incorporation after a loan has been made shall continue to be taxed or assessed for the repayment of its proportionate part of the unpaid balance of the loan.

If a zone is formed to be responsible for the loan, the  board of supervisors shall, in the first fiscal year in which a special tax or assessment may be levied in the zone, and in each succeeding year of the duration of the zone, levy a special tax or assessment upon the taxable property in the zone for the purpose of repaying with interest the amount lent to the district by the county.  When the loan has been repaid, the zone shall terminate.

In case of emergency, the board of supervisors may also borrow funds from another maintenance district and the board of supervisors may lend available district funds to another maintenance district.  Such loans shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as loans made from county funds.



######### 5836.  
The title to all property acquired by a maintenance district shall be vested in the county. Upon the dissolution of the district by reason of all of its territory being included within a city, such property shall thereupon become the property of such city, and if all of the district is included within more than one city then such property shall be subject to the disposition of the board of supervisors of the county. Such disposition shall be between the several cities in such manner as to the board seems most just and equitable.



######### 5837.  
The boundaries of any maintenance district may be altered, and contiguous or noncontiguous territory whether it is within incorporated or unincorporated territory may be annexed thereto. If incorporated territory is sought to be annexed, consent thereto shall first be obtained from the legislative body of the city.

The board of supervisors may by resolution fix a time and place for hearing upon the question of annexation of such territory to an existing maintenance district.  The resolution shall describe the boundaries of the territory proposed to be annexed.

The board of supervisors may by resolution determine that each parcel of the territory annexed or to be annexed to a sewer maintenance district should pay its proportionate share of the cost of outfall and/or pumping plant construction previously paid for by other properties within said district and shall in said resolution fix the amount to be contributed by each said parcel.  No parcel so annexed or to be annexed shall be issued a permit to connect to the sewer until the full amount of contribution so fixed has been paid.  Any contribution whether heretofore or hereafter collected for such purposes shall be deposited in the county treasury to the credit of said district, or shall be held in trust until the parcel is included within the boundaries of the district at which time such contributions shall be transferred to the credit of said district.

The date set for the hearing on the proposed annexation shall be at least three weeks from and after the date of the adoption of the resolution setting the hearing.



######### 5838.  
The board of supervisors shall cause notice of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing to be given by mail to each owner whose name and address appears on the last equalized assessment roll and who owns real property within the boundaries of the territory sought to be annexed. The notice shall contain the name and telephone number of a local department or agency designated by the board of supervisors to answer inquiries regarding the hearing proceedings. The person directed by the board of supervisors to mail the notices shall file, upon the completion of the mailing, an affidavit setting forth the time and manner of the compliance with this section.

In addition, the board of supervisors shall cause notices of the hearing to be posted in three conspicuous places within the territory proposed to be annexed. 

The notices shall be headed “Notice of hearing” in letters not less than one inch in height and shall contain a description of the territory proposed to be annexed and a statement of the time and place of the hearing.  In lieu of the description the boundaries of territory proposed to be annexed may be shown by means of a diagram printed upon the notice.  The notice shall be posted not less than 10 days prior to the date set for the hearing.

In proceedings for annexation to sewer, lighting, or drainage maintenance districts, the board of supervisors shall direct its clerk to publish a notice once a week for two successive weeks in the newspaper of general circulation that the board deems most likely to give notice of hearing to the inhabitants.  Such notice shall state the time and place of the hearing and shall contain a description of the territory proposed to be annexed or, in lieu of such description, the boundaries of the territory proposed to be annexed may be shown by means of a diagram.  Such publication together with the posting of notices of hearing may be deemed adequate notice and no mailed notice need be required.



######### 5839.  
At the time fixed for the hearing or to which it may be continued, the board of supervisors shall hear and pass upon the proposal and any objections which may be filed to the inclusion of any property within the proposed annexation.

The board of supervisors may, by order entered upon its minutes, determine that such territory or any part thereof may be annexed to the district and may order that the boundaries of the district be altered to include such territory if one or more of the following facts exist:

(a) The territory to be annexed will be benefited by annexation.

(b) The annexation will allow economies and efficiencies in the administration or operation of an existing lighting system in the territory to be annexed.



######### 5840.  
If any portion of the territory annexed to a maintenance district comprises a portion of another maintenance district formed under the provisions of this chapter, a highway lighting district organized pursuant to Part 4 (commencing with Section 19000) of Division 14, or a sewer maintenance district formed under the provisions of Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 4860), Part 3, Division 5 of the Health and Safety Code, the annexation of such territory shall not become complete unless and until any outstanding contract of the other district of which such territory is a part has expired or such contract, with the consent of the parties thereto, has been modified or canceled so as to relieve the other district of further obligation to pay for future contract obligations within the portion of the territory so withdrawn, and the funds of such other district remaining on hand upon the completion of such annexation shall have been apportioned between the maintenance district to which the territory was annexed and the other district from which it was withdrawn. The division of such funds shall be prorated in the proportion that the assessed value of the real property of the territory so withdrawn bore to the total assessed value of the real property within the district prior to such withdrawal.



######### 5841.  
If the territory annexed to a maintenance district includes within its boundaries all of another maintenance district formed under the provisions of this chapter, a highway lighting district organized pursuant to Part 4 (commencing with Section 19000) of Division 14, or a sewer maintenance district formed under the provisions of Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 4860), Part 3, Division 5 of the Health and Safety Code, upon such annexation becoming complete by the adoption of the order of the board of supervisors, the prior existing district so annexed shall thereupon be dissolved. Any funds of the district remaining on hand at the time of the annexation shall be transferred to the maintenance district to which such territory is annexed and any contracts or obligations of the previously existing district shall become the obligations of the maintenance district to which it is annexed.



######### 5841.5.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, subsequent to annexation of such territory and dissolution of the annexed district, the maintenance district shall assume all of the assets and liabilities of the dissolved district and shall be entitled to all of the property tax revenues to which the territory annexed would have been entitled had the territory not been so annexed.



######### 5842.  
If, after the formation of a maintenance district, additional improvements of the same type or nature are constructed within the boundaries of such district, the board of supervisors shall adopt a resolution declaring its intention that the cost of maintaining and operating such additional improvements shall be borne by the existing maintenance district. It shall fix a time and place for a hearing on such resolution, at which hearing any and all persons having any objections to the things proposed to be done may appear and be heard. The resolution shall contain a statement of the estimated annual cost of maintaining and operating such additional improvements.



######### 5843.  
Notice of the hearing on the resolution shall be given to the persons within the existing maintenance district in the manner prescribed by Section 5838. Mailed notice shall be required with respect to additional improvements for a lighting maintenance district where the annual cost to such district of such additional improvements is more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500). At the hearing the board of supervisors shall hear and pass upon any and all protests to the maintaining and operating of such additional improvements by the existing maintenance district and its decision shall be final and conclusive. At the conclusion of the hearing the board of supervisors may by order, entered upon its minutes, make the expenses of maintaining and operating such additional improvements a charge upon the existing maintenance district.



######### 5843.5.  
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the board of supervisors, upon its own motion or upon receipt of a petition signed by 20 or more taxpayers of an existing lighting maintenance district asking for the installation and maintenance of additional lights, may, by order entered upon its minutes, make the expenses of the installation and maintenance of the additional lights a charge upon the existing district if the board determines that it will be just and equitable, and in the public interest for the additional cost, if any, to be paid by the district as a whole. If sufficient funds are available or will be available from a tax levy already made or after the tax levy has been made, the board may proceed with the installation of the additional lights.



######### 5844.  
Any portion of any maintenance district which will not be benefited by remaining within the district, may be withdrawn therefrom. The board of supervisors may by resolution entered upon its minutes fix a time for a hearing on the question of the withdrawal of any portion of a maintenance district which will not be benefited by remaining within the district.



######### 5845.  
The time for the hearing shall be not less than 10 nor more than 30 days after the date of the adoption of the resolution. The board of supervisors shall at least five days prior to the time so fixed cause a notice of such hearing to be published by one insertion in such daily, weekly or semiweekly newspaper printed, published and circulated in the county, as the board deems most likely to give notice to the inhabitants of the district of the proposed withdrawal. Copies of the notice also shall be posted at least one week prior to the date fixed for the hearing in three conspicuous places within that portion of the maintenance district sought to be withdrawn and in three conspicuous places within the remaining portion of the district.



######### 5846.  
Any person interested may appear at the hearing and object to the withdrawal of said portion from the maintenance district, or may object to the continuance of the remaining territory as a maintenance district. The board of supervisors shall consider and pass upon all objections and if it finds that the portion of the district sought to be withdrawn will not be benefited by remaining within the maintenance district and that the remaining territory not sought to be withdrawn will be benefited by continuing as a maintenance district, then it shall order such withdrawal and the continuance of the remaining territory as a maintenance district.



######### 5847.  
No withdrawal of territory under the provisions of Section 5846 or 5853 shall become effective unless and until any outstanding contract of the maintenance district from which a portion is sought to be withdrawn has expired, or such contract, with the consent of the parties thereto, has been modified or canceled so as to relieve such maintenance district of further obligation to pay for future maintenance within the territory so withdrawn.



######### 5847.5.  
Any maintenance district created to finance any work which might also be constructed or maintained by a county sanitation district, may become a part of a county sanitation district after the board of supervisors of the county within which the maintenance district is located has, after a hearing held pursuant to the County Sanitation District Act (Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 4700), Part 3, Division 5 of the Health and Safety Code), determined by resolution that such inclusion is for the best interest of the maintenance district and the governing body of the maintenance district consents to the inclusion by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of its members.



######### 5847.6.  
A maintenance district included in a county sanitation district pursuant to Section 5847.5 is not dissolved by such inclusion, but may continue to function in the same manner that it functioned before the inclusion.



######### 5848.  
Any maintenance district may be dissolved by the board of supervisors. The board of supervisors upon its own motion may adopt a resolution declaring its intention to dissolve the maintenance district and may fix a time for a hearing upon such dissolution. The time for such hearing shall be not less than 10 days nor more than 30 days after the date of the adoption of such resolution, and the clerk of the board of supervisors shall, at least 15 days prior to the time so fixed, publish notice of such hearing by one insertion in a daily, weekly or semiweekly newspaper printed, published and circulated in the county, and cause printed copies of such notice to be posted in three conspicuous places within the maintenance district.



######### 5849.  
At the time appointed for such hearing, or at any time to which it is adjourned, the board of supervisors shall hear and pass upon the question of dissolution and all objections and protests and may grant or deny the same, and its decision thereon shall be final and conclusive. If the board of supervisors upon such hearing determines that the maintenance district shall be dissolved, the board of supervisors shall, by resolution, order the dissolution of the district and the district shall thereupon be dissolved. The maintenance and operation of the improvements of such district may be continued thereafter until the funds collected for the purpose of maintaining and operating them have been expended for that purpose.



######### 5850.  
Upon the inclusion of all of the territory of a maintenance district within one or more cities, either by reason of annexation proceedings or by reason of the incorporation of one or more cities, and upon dissolution of such district, all funds paid into the county treasury to the credit of such district shall be paid over by the board of supervisors of such district as prescribed in this chapter.



######### 5851.  
If the whole district is so included within one city, the district shall continue in existence for all purposes until a copy of a resolution adopted by the city requesting dissolution of the district or requesting transfer of jurisdiction over the district and the funds of the district to the city is filed with the board of supervisors whereupon the district shall be dissolved or jurisdiction over the district shall be transferred by resolution of the board of supervisors to the city, as requested by the resolution adopted by the city, and such funds shall be paid to the treasurer of that city and administered by the legislative body of the city for the benefit of the district.



######### 5852.  
If a part only of the district is so included within one city and the remaining part of the district is so included within one or more other cities, so that no portion of the district remains within unincorporated territory of the county, the district shall continue in existence for all purposes until a copy of a joint resolution adopted by all of the cities requesting dissolution of the district is filed with the board of supervisors whereupon the district shall be dissolved. The proportionate part of such funds shall be paid to the treasurer of each such city as the assessed valuation of the real property of the portion of the district included therein bore, before being so included, to the total assessed valuation of the real property of the district, and such funds shall be administered by the legislative bodies of such cities for the benefit of the district. Any one city may withdraw its territory from the district in the manner provided by Section 5853.



######### 5853.  
Whenever any portion of a district is included within a city by reason of incorporation, annexation, or otherwise, such portion shall continue to remain a part of the district for all purposes until a copy of a resolution adopted by the city requesting exclusion of such territory from the district is received by the board of supervisors. Upon the withdrawal of any territory of a district, all property acquired for the district and all unencumbered funds on the date of withdrawal, including all taxes levied and collected by the district in any year in which taxes are levied and collected by the district after the date of withdrawal on property withdrawn from the district, shall be divided between the city and the remaining district in proportion to the assessed value of the real property of the territory so withdrawn and the portion remaining. For the purpose of this article, the unencumbered funds are the sum of money, uncollected taxes, and other uncollected amounts belonging to or due such district, in excess of an amount sufficient to pay all claims and accounts against the district.



######### 5854.  
The board of supervisors may by resolution change the name of any maintenance district to conform with a change in the street name or other designation which the district bears. The clerk of the board of supervisors shall file in the office of the county assessor and with the State Board of Equalization a certified copy of every such resolution, and upon such filing the name of the district shall be changed for all purposes.



######### 5855.  
Where the board of supervisors or legislative body has so declared in its resolution of intention to order the formation of a maintenance district or any annexation thereto, the board of supervisors or legislative body may, in its resolution ordering the formation of a maintenance district or any annexation thereto, order the district divided into tax assessment zones. Tax assessment zones may be formed at a time other than at the formation of the district or any annexation thereto if pursuant to the same procedure of resolution, notice, and hearing as are applicable under this chapter to the annexation of territory.

No district shall be divided into zones unless the board of supervisors or legislative body finds that a tax assessment zone requires special services or special facilities in addition to those provided generally by the maintenance district or the replacement of obsolete equipment, and that the tax levy is commensurate with the special benefits to be provided in the zone. The boundaries of tax assessment zones may be changed or a zone may be dissolved in the same manner that a zone may be formed in an existing district.

When a zone is formed for the purpose of the construction or installation of special facilities in addition to those provided generally by the district or to replace obsolete equipment, the board of supervisors or legislative body may provide at the time of formation for the automatic dissolution of the zone upon payment of all assessments attributable to the special facilities.



######### 5856.  
If a maintenance district is divided into zones, the board of supervisors or legislative body may determine what portion of the amount of money to be secured from the levy of taxes shall be secured from each zone within the district.







#### CHAPTER 27. Construction of Sidewalks and Curbs [5870 - 5895.54]  


##### ARTICLE 1. General Provisions [5870 - 5873]  

######### 5870.  
As used in this chapter:

(a) “Block” means property facing one side of any street between the next intersecting streets or between the terminus of a dedicated right-of-way of a street and an intersecting street.  “Street” does not include an alley or other right-of-way unless it is of the same width as a regular residential minimum-width street approved as part of a master plan of circulation or streets by the governmental agency involved.  In the case of an alley, “block” means property facing both sides of any alley between the next intersecting streets or alleys, or between the terminus of an alley and an intersecting street.  In the case of street lighting, “block” means property facing the side of any street on which the improvement is to be constructed between the next intersecting streets on the side to be improved or between the terminus of a dedicated right-of-way of a street and a street intersecting the side to be improved; or property facing the side of any street on which the improvement is to be constructed between the next intersecting streets on the side to be improved or between the terminus of a dedicated right-of-way of a street and a street intersecting the side to be improved and the property facing the opposite side of the street.

Where a “block” exceeds 1,000 feet in length, a length of frontage of 1,000 feet constitutes a “block” as used in this chapter, if so designated by the superintendent of streets.  A determination by the superintendent of streets of such a 1,000-foot block establishes a “block” and cannot later be changed to include a portion of said 1,000-foot “block” in another “block.”

(b) “Driveway” means a paved portion of a public street providing an unobstructed passage from the roadway to an offstreet area used for driving, servicing, parking, or otherwise accommodating motor vehicles.



######### 5871.  
(a) This chapter applies to the construction of sidewalks, gutters, pavements, driveways, and curbs, and the installation of storm and sanitary drainage facilities, water mains, pipes, conduits, tunnels, hydrants, and other necessary works and appliances for providing water service, parkway trees, and street lighting facilities in front of properties in any block where a sidewalk, gutter, pavement, driveway, the installation of storm and sanitary sewer drainage facilities, water mains, pipes, conduits, tunnels, hydrants, and other necessary works and appliances for providing water service, parkway trees, and street lighting facilities, or curb, or all of them, have been previously constructed in front of properties in the block constituting more than 50 percent of the front footage of the block, or where the owners of more than 60 percent of the front footage of the block, as shown by the last equalized assessment roll of the city, file a petition with the city clerk requesting the installation of any of those improvements, or where a petition signed by the owners of more than 60 percent of the front footage of any part of an unimproved portion or portions of a block has been filed with the city clerk requesting the installation of those improvements in front of that part.

(b) This chapter does not apply to the construction of improvements of the type specified in subdivision (a) fronting on, or otherwise adjacent to, or in conjunction with, an arterial or collector street section.  For purposes of this section, an “arterial or collector street section” is a street section with more than one traffic lane in each direction either before or after the proposed improvement, or a street section on which more than 70 percent of the average daily vehicle trips do not originate or end within the proposed assessment district.   

(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), this chapter applies to the construction of sidewalks, curbs, and gutters appurtenant thereto, sufficient paving to provide a parking lane, and to parkway trees and street lighting facilities, but only to the extent that those improvements are in front of the property on arterial or collector street sections, which is otherwise subject to assessment, if the property has not been subject to any other special assessment to pay for construction of sidewalks, curbs, gutters, parking lane paving, parkway trees, or street lighting facilities within the preceding 10 years.  As used in this subdivision, “gutters” shall include only above-ground structures appurtenant to sidewalks and curbs.

As used in this subdivision, “parking lane” means a paved area adjacent to the curb which is used exclusively for on-street parking.  It does not include any portion of the street used for through traffic or as a bicycle lane.  An assessment for parking lane purposes shall not include the cost of any signs necessitated by the parking lane.  If property is assessed for a parking lane pursuant to this chapter and the parking lane is subsequently converted to another use, the amount of the assessment paid, together with interest at the prime rate plus 3 percent, shall be paid by the city to the then owner of the property.

(d) This chapter does not apply to driveway construction in front of a vacant lot, or in front of an unimproved property, unless requested by the owner.

(e) This chapter does not apply to the repair, resurfacing, or maintenance of streets.

(f) As used in this chapter, “sidewalks or curbs” includes “gutters,” “driveways,” “pavement” to the centerline of the street, “full pavement” in alleys, “storm and sanitary drainage facilities,” “water mains,” “pipes,” “ conduits,” “tunnels,” “hydrants,” and “other necessary works and appliances for providing water service,” “paving to provide a parking lane on arterial or collector street sections,” “parkway trees,” and “street lighting facilities;” and “superintendent of streets” includes any other person or persons who may be designated by the legislative body to perform any of the duties of the superintendent of streets set forth in this chapter.

(g) “Fronting” and “facing,” as used in this chapter, means “abutting” in the case of property adjoining an alley improvement.

(h) In the case of street lighting, in determining how much of the front footage of a block has been improved, the front footage of property benefiting from existing installations may be included regardless of the side of the street on which the installation has been constructed.



######### 5872.  
This chapter constitutes a separate and alternative procedure for performing the work specified herein, and except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no other provision of this division, excepting definitions, shall apply to proceedings instituted hereunder. Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 5220) applies to any proceedings taken under this chapter. The “Special Assessment Investigation, Limitation and Majority Protection Act of 1931” does not apply to proceedings taken under this chapter.

######### 5876.  
When the superintendent of streets finds that sidewalks or curbs have been constructed, or that their construction has been guaranteed to his satisfaction, in front of properties constituting more than fifty percent (50%) of the frontage in any block, or where a petition signed by the owners of more than sixty percent (60%) of the front footage of the block has been filed with the city clerk requesting the installation of such improvements, or where a petition signed by the owners of more than sixty percent (60%) of the front footage of any part of an unimproved portion or portions of a block has been filed with the city clerk requesting the installation of such improvements in front of said part, or whenever the legislative body of the city upon its own motion has ordered the installation of such improvements in front of said part, said superintendent of streets may, and upon the instructions of the legislative body of the city shall, notify the owner or person in possession of the property fronting on that portion of the street in such block in which no sidewalks or curbs have been constructed theretofore, to construct or cause to be constructed sidewalks or curbs in front of his property.



######### 5877.  
Notice to construct may be given by delivering a written notice personally to the owner or to the person in possession of the property facing upon the sidewalks or curbs to be constructed or by mailing a postal card, postage prepaid, to the person in possession of such property, or to the owner thereof at his last known address as the same appears on the last equalized assessment rolls of such city or to the name and address of the person owning such property as shown in the records of the office of the clerk.



######### 5878.  
The postal card shall contain a notice to construct the sidewalks or curbs as the case may be, and the superintendent of streets shall, immediately upon the mailing of the notice, cause a copy thereof, printed on a card of not less than 8 inches by 10 inches in size, to be posted in a conspicuous place on the property.



######### 5878.1.  
The notice shall also specify the day, hour, and place when the legislative body will hear and pass upon objections or protests, if any, which may be raised by any property owner or other interested persons, but in no case shall the hearing be sooner than 10 days after giving of notice. Upon the day and hour fixed for the hearing, the legislative body shall hear and pass upon objections or protests in accordance with Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 5220).

The hearing required by this section is in addition to the hearing required by Section 5881.



######### 5879.  
The notice shall particularly specify what work is required to be done, and how it is to be done, and what materials shall be used in the construction and shall further specify that if the construction is not commenced within 60 days after notice is given and diligently and without interruption prosecuted to completion, the superintendent of streets shall cause the construction to be done, and the cost of the same shall be a lien on the property. However, upon petition by all of the affected property owners, the 60-day period may be waived and the superintendent of streets may immediately cause the construction to be done, and the cost of the same shall be a lien upon the property.



######### 5879.1.  
The legislative body may adopt a resolution determining that bonds shall be issued and assessments collected and enforced pursuant to Part 5 of this division. In such event, the notice shall also specify that bonds shall be issued to represent the security of the unpaid assessments, payable over a period of not to exceed 10 years, and shall further recite a maximum rate of interest to be paid on the indebtedness, which shall not exceed 7 percent a year, payable semiannually.



######### 5880.  
If the construction is not commenced and prosecuted to completion with due diligence, as required by the notice or by the legislative body after the hearing required by Section 5878.1 of this chapter, the superintendent of streets shall forthwith construct the sidewalks or curbs.



######### 5881.  
Upon the completion of the construction, the superintendent of streets shall cause notice of the cost of the construction to be given in the manner specified in this article for the giving of notice to construct, which notice shall specify the day, hour and place when the legislative body will hear and pass upon a report by the superintendent of streets of the cost of the construction, together with any objections or protests, if any, which may be raised by any property owner liable to be assessed for the cost of such construction and any other interested persons. In no case shall the hearing provided for in this section be sooner than 10 days after giving of notice. If bonds are to be issued, the notice shall also contain the information required by Section 5879.1.

The cost of the construction may include a proportionate share, as determined by the legislative body, of the cost of improvements constructed in a place other than in front of a parcel of property which are required for the proper functioning of the improvements in front of the parcel.



######### 5882.  
Upon the completion of the construction, the superintendent of streets shall prepare and file with the legislative body a report specifying the work which has been done, the cost of construction, a description of the real property in front of which the work has been done and the assessment against each lot or parcel of land proposed to be levied to pay the cost or portion thereof. The report may include work done in front of any number of parcels of property, whether contiguous to each other or not. In determining the amount of the assessment against each lot or parcel of land, the superintendent shall assess the same portion of the total cost of the work against each lot or parcel as that parcel will receive of the total benefit from the work.



######### 5883.  
Upon the day and hour fixed for the hearing the legislative body shall hear and pass upon the report of the superintendent of streets, together with any objections or protests which may be raised by any of the property owners liable to be assessed for such construction and any other interested persons. Thereupon the legislative body may make such revision, correction or modifications in the report as it may deem just, after which, by motion or resolution, the report as submitted, or as revised, corrected or modified, shall be confirmed. The legislative body may adjourn the hearings from time to time. The decisions of the legislative body on all protests and objections which may be made, shall be final and conclusive.









##### ARTICLE 3. Collection of Cost of Construction [5890 - 5895.1]  

######### 5890.  
The assessments proposed by the superintendent of streets pursuant to Section 5882, as may be amended by the legislative body during the hearing held pursuant to Section 5883, may be confirmed and levied by the legislative body against the parcels of property fronting upon the sidewalks or curbs so constructed, and the cost so assessed, if not paid within five days after its confirmation by the legislative body, shall constitute a special assessment against each of those parcels, and shall be a lien on the property for the amount thereof from the time of recordation of the notice of lien, which lien shall continue until the assessment and all interest thereon is paid, or until it is discharged of record.



######### 5890.5.  
In assessing land, credit may be given for dedications and for improvements constructed at private expense.



######### 5891.  
The superintendent of streets may file in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the parcel of property is located, a certificate substantially in the following form, to wit:
Notice of Lien


Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Improvement Act of 1911, I did, on the ____ day of ____, 20__, cause the sidewalk or curb to be constructed, and the legislative body of said city (county, or city and county) did, on the ____ day of ____, 20__, by Resolution No. ____ assess the cost of such construction upon the real property hereinafter described, and the same has not been paid nor any part thereof, and the said city (county, or city and county), does hereby claim a lien on said real property in the sum of ____ dollars ($____), and the same shall be a lien upon said real property until the said sum, with interest at the rate of ____ percent (insert rate of interest as fixed by legislative body, not to exceed 6 percent) per annum, from the said ____ day of ____, 20__, (insert date of the thirty-first day after confirmation of assessment), has been paid in full and discharged of record.

The real property hereinbefore mentioned and upon which a lien is claimed, is that certain piece or parcel of land lying and being in the (name of city, or city and county) the County of ____, State of ____, and particularly described as follows, to wit:

######### 5892.  
From and after the date of the recording of the notice of lien, all persons shall be deemed to have had notice of the contents thereof. The notice of lien may include claims against one or more separate parcels of property, whether contiguous or not, together with the amount due, respectively, from each such parcel. The statute of limitation shall not run against the right of the city to enforce the payment of the lien. If any such lien is not paid the city may file and maintain an action to foreclose such lien in the same manner and under the same procedure, so far as applicable, as that under which delinquent bonds are foreclosed under this division.



######### 5893.  
As an alternative method of collection of the amount of the lien, the legislative body, after confirmation of the report of the superintendent of streets, may order the notice of lien to be turned over to the accounting officer and the tax collector of the city, whereupon it shall be the duty of those officers to add the amount of the assessment to the next regular bill for taxes levied against the lot or parcel of land. If city taxes are collected by the county officials, the notice of lien shall be delivered to the county auditor, who shall enter the amount thereof on the county assessment book opposite the description of the particular property and the amount shall be collected together with all other taxes thereon against the property. The notice of lien shall be delivered to the county auditor before the date fixed by law for the delivery of the assessment book to the county board of equalization.



######### 5894.  
Thereafter the amount of the lien shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary city taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and interest and to the same procedure under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary city taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of city taxes and county taxes are hereby made applicable to such special assessment taxes.



######### 5895.  
The legislative body shall have the power, in its discretion, to determine that the payment of such assessments of fifty dollars ($50) or more may be made in annual installments, in any event not to exceed 10, and that the payment of assessments so deferred shall bear interest on the unpaid balance at a rate to be determined by the legislative body, not to exceed 7 percent per annum. Said interest shall begin to run on the 31st day after the confirmation of the assessments by the legislative body. All such determinations may be expressed by resolution of the legislative body at any time prior to the confirmation of the assessments.



######### 5895.1.  
If bonds are to be issued to represent the security of the unpaid assessments, upon confirmation of the report by the legislative body the superintendent of streets shall give notice to pay by mail and by publication substantially in the manner provided by Sections 4320 and 4321. The period for payment in cash stated therein shall be 30 days following the confirmation of the report. Upon completion of such cash payment period, the superintendent of streets shall file with the county recorder a certificate substantially in the form set out in Section 5891, giving notice therein that interest is payable at a rate to be fixed upon the sale of bonds, which rate shall not exceed 7 percent per annum. Thereafter the provisions of Part 5 of this division shall be applicable and payments on assessments at bond shall be made as therein provided. Such bonds may be issued and sold as the legislative body directs and may be dated at any time after the expiration of the cash payment period.









##### ARTICLE 4. Construction Outside of Jurisdiction [5895.50 - 5895.54]  

######### 5895.50.  
Whenever the property, which fronts on an area where improvements are required to be constructed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, lies entirely or partially within a city or unincorporated territory of a county and the improvement area or portions thereof lie within one or more other cities or unincorporated territory of one or more other counties, the superintendent of streets of any city or county having jurisdiction over all or a portion of the area to be improved shall have full authority to serve notices, to construct, and to do all work contemplated by Article 2 (commencing with Section 5875) and Article 3 (commencing with Section 5890) of this chapter, notwithstanding the fact that the property fronting on the improvement area lies entirely or partially within another city or unincorporated territory of another county.



######### 5895.51.  
Whenever a block, on which improvements are required to be constructed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, lies within a city or unincorporated territory of a county and within one or more other cities or unincorporated territory of one or more other counties, the superintendent of streets of any city or county having jurisdiction over a part of the block shall have full authority to serve notices, to construct, and to do all work contemplated by Article 2 (commencing with Section 5875) and Article 3 (commencing with Section 5890) of this chapter in that portion of the block lying in the territory of another jurisdiction after the superintendent obtains consent from the legislative body of that jurisdiction.

The consent of the legislative body shall be given by resolution adopted by a majority vote of the body’s membership.  Thereafter, except as provided in Section 5895.54, the city or county whose superintendent of streets obtained the consent shall have jurisdiction over such areas for the purpose of sidewalk or curb construction.



######### 5895.52.  
The city or county proceeding under the provisions of this article may pay for such work out of the road fund or any other fund available for such purposes.



######### 5895.53.  
The legislative body of the city or county which undertakes the construction of improvements pursuant to the provisions of this article shall have the authority to levy an assessment to pay the cost of any such construction of improvements, notwithstanding the fact that the improvements or the property fronting on the improvements lies outside the territory of the city or county. Such assessment shall be levied, shall be a lien, and shall be collected in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 (commencing with Section 5890) of this chapter. The assessments so collected shall be paid to the treasurer of the city or county under whose authority the improvements were constructed.



######### 5895.54.  
Nothing contained in this article shall limit in any manner the police power of any city or county with reference to any sidewalk or curb contructed under the provisions of this article.

To the extent that the agreement provides that all, or any part, of the work or improvement is to be performed by the public utility, cable operator, or public agency, the provisions of this division requiring competitive bidding and the award of the contract to the lowest responsible bidder shall be inapplicable.

(d) Nothing in this chapter precludes the city, cable operator, or the public utility, in the event of disagreement regarding any provision of the proposed agreement, from seeking review of the disagreement by the Public Utilities Commission.



######### 5896.10.  
If the work or improvement consists solely of a conversion, and the work or improvement is performed by a public utility, cable operator, or public agency, the resolution of intention shall provide that (a) the warrant, assessment, and diagram or (b) any bonds issued or to be issued to represent unpaid assessments, or both (a) and (b), shall be sold as the legislative body directs.

######### 5896.13.  
If the work or improvement consists solely of conversion of electric or communication facilities owned or operated by the city and the legislative body has provided that such work or improvement shall be performed by the city or any department, agency, commission or officer of the city, the warrant, assessment and diagram and all bonds issued to represent unpaid assessments shall be delivered to the city and the city shall thereupon have the same rights and liens as the contractor to collect and enforce the payment of the assessments and all bonds issued to represent unpaid assessments. In such event, (a) such warrant, assessment and diagram or (b) any bonds issued or to be issued to represent unpaid assessment, or both (a) and (b), may be sold as the legislative body directs and the purchaser, and any successors, shall thereupon succeed to all of the rights and liens of the city.

If the work and improvement consists, in part, of a conversion and, in part, of other types of work or improvement, the legislative body may provide in the resolution of intention that the costs and expenses of conversion shall constititute part of the incidental expenses to be advanced to the city by the contractor and to be included in the assessment.

This work may be done by the contractor, or the public utility, cable operator, public agency, or city performing the conversion work, and the cost thereof included in the assessment to be levied upon the lot or parcel, provided that the owner shall execute a written request therefor and file it with the clerk. Any such request shall expressly authorize the contractor, public utility, cable operator, public agency, or city, and the respective officers, agents, and employees of each, to enter upon the lot or parcel for that purpose and shall waive any right of protest or objection in respect of the doing of that work and the inclusion of the cost thereof in the assessment.

#### CHAPTER 29. Contractual Assessments [5898.10 - 5899.4]  


##### ARTICLE 1. General Provisions [5898.10 - 5898.18]  

######### 5898.10.  
This chapter provides an alternative procedure for authorizing assessments to finance any work which may be done pursuant to this division. The terms and definitions of this division apply to this chapter, except as otherwise provided. The Special Assessment Investigation, Limitation, and Majority Protest Act of 1931 (Division 4 (commencing with Section 2800)) does not apply to any proceedings taken under this chapter.



######### 5898.12.  
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature that this chapter should be used to finance public improvements to lots or parcels that are developed and where the costs and time delays involved in creating an assessment district pursuant to other provisions of this division or any other law would be prohibitively large relative to the cost of the public improvements to be financed.

(b) It is also the intent of the Legislature that this chapter should be used to finance the installation or prepaid service contract, or both, of distributed generation renewable energy sources or energy efficiency improvements that are permanently fixed to residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property.

(c) It is also the intent of the Legislature to address chronic water needs throughout California by permitting voluntary individual efforts to improve water efficiency. The Legislature further intends that this chapter should be used to finance the installation of water efficiency improvements that are permanently fixed to residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property, including, but not limited to, recycled water connections, synthetic turf, cisterns for stormwater recovery, and permeable pavement.

(d) It is also the intent of the Legislature that a public agency in the process of establishing an assessment program, to the extent feasible, use a good faith effort to provide advance notice of the proposed program to water and electric service providers in the relevant service area, as set forth in Section 5898.24, to allow the most efficient coordination and collaboration between the public agency and water and electric service providers.

(e) This chapter shall not be used to finance facilities for parcels in connection with the initial construction of a residential building, unless the initial construction is undertaken by the intended owner or occupant.

(f) This chapter shall not be used to finance the purchase or installation of appliances that are not permanently fixed to residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property.

(g) Assessments may be levied pursuant to this chapter only with the free and willing consent of the owner of each lot or parcel on which an assessment is levied at the time the assessment is levied.



######### 5898.14.  
(a) The Legislature finds all of the following:

(1) Energy and water conservation efforts, including the promotion of energy efficiency improvements to residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property are necessary to address the issue of global climate change.

(2) The upfront cost of making residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property more energy and water efficient prevents many property owners from making those improvements. To make those improvements more affordable and to promote the installation of those improvements, it is necessary to authorize an alternative procedure for authorizing assessments to finance the cost of energy and water efficiency improvements.

(b) The Legislature declares that a public purpose will be served by a voluntary contractual assessment program that provides the legislative body of any public agency with the authority to finance the installation of distributed generation renewable energy sources and energy or water efficiency improvements that are permanently fixed to residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property.



######### 5898.15.  
(a) A public agency shall not permit a property owner to participate in any program established pursuant to this chapter if the owner’s participation would result in the total amount of any annual property taxes and assessments exceeding 5 percent of the property’s market value, as determined at the time of approval of the owner’s contractual assessment.

(b) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to void or otherwise release a property owner from the contractual obligations incurred by a contractual assessment on a property, particularly in the event that the total amount of annual property taxes and assessments exceeds 5 percent of a property’s market value after the property owner has entered into a contractual assessment pursuant to this chapter.

(c) This section applies to a property owner who seeks to participate in a program established pursuant to this chapter for types of property not subject to the requirements of Sections 5898.16 and 5898.17.



######### 5898.16.  
(a) A public agency shall not permit a property owner to participate in any program established pursuant to this chapter for the purposes specified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 5898.20 or Section 5899, 5899.3, or 5899.4 if any of the following apply:

(1) The property owner’s participation would result in the total amount of the annual property taxes and assessments exceeding 5 percent of the property’s market value, as determined at the time of approval of the property owner’s contractual assessment.

(2) The property does not comply with the conditions specified in paragraphs (1) to (5), inclusive, and paragraph (8), and, in addition, for properties with energy efficiency improvements specified under Section 5898.20 of this code and paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 26063 of the Public Resources Code.

(b) A public agency shall not permit the property owner to participate in any program established pursuant to this chapter for the purposes specified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 5898.20 or Section 5899, 5899.3, or 5899.4 unless the property owner is given the right to cancel the contractual assessment without penalty or obligation, consistent with the following:

(1) (A) The property owner shall receive the right to cancel document set forth below or a substantially similar document that displays the same information in a substantially similar format. The document shall be provided to the property owner as a printed copy unless the property owner agrees to an electronic copy.

(d) For purposes of enabling sellers of real property subject to a voluntary contractual assessment to satisfy the notice requirements of Section 1102.6b of the Civil Code, the legislative body shall cause to be recorded in the office of the county recorder for the county in which the real property is located, concurrently with the instrument creating the voluntary contractual assessment, a separate document that meets all of the following requirements:

(f) In order to reduce the costs associated with contractual assessments, a legislative body may authorize the document described in subdivision (d) to be combined with the notice required by Section 5898.32, and recorded as a single document.



######### 5898.26.  
At the time of the hearing, the report shall be summarized and the legislative body shall afford all persons who are present an opportunity to comment upon, object to, or present evidence with regard to the proposed contractual assessment program, the extent of the area proposed to be included within the program, the terms and conditions of the draft contract, or the proposed financing provisions. At the conclusion of the hearing, the legislative body may adopt a resolution confirming the report or may direct its modification in any respect, and thereafter may adopt a resolution confirming the report as modified, or the legislative body may abandon the proceedings. However, the legislative body may not increase the area within which contractual assessments would be offered without providing notice of the proposed increase in area pursuant to Section 5808.24. The hearing may be continued from time to time not exceeding a total of 180 days.



######### 5898.28.  
(a) A public agency may issue bonds pursuant to this chapter, the principal and interest for which would be repaid by voluntary contractual assessments. A public agency may advance its own funds to finance work to be repaid through voluntary contractual assessments, and may from time to time sell bonds to reimburse itself for those advances. A public agency may enter into a relationship with an underwriter or financial institution that would allow the sequential issuance of a series of bonds, each bond being issued as the need arose to finance work to be repaid through voluntary contractual assessments. The interest rate of each bond may be determined by an appropriate index, but shall be fixed at the time each bond is issued unless the bond is issued to finance improvements to nonresidential private property or residential private property with four or more units. Bond proceeds may be used to establish a reserve fund for debt service or paying the costs of foreclosure on properties participating in the program, to fund capitalized interest for a period up to two years from the date of issuance of the bonds, to fund the administrative fee required for participation in the PACE Reserve Program established pursuant to Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 26050) of Division 16 of the Public Resources Code, and to pay for expenses incidental to the issuance and sale of the bonds. Division 10 (commencing with Section 8500) shall apply to any bonds issued pursuant to this section, insofar as that division is not in conflict with this chapter.

(b) (1) Notwithstanding any provision of this division or the Improvement Act of 1915 (Division 10 (commencing with Section 8500)), a public agency may transfer its right, title, and interest in and to any voluntary contractual assessments, if bonds have not been issued pursuant to subdivision (a). The public agency and the transferee shall enter into an agreement that, among other things, identifies the specific period of time during which the transfer of voluntary contractual assessments will be operative, not to exceed three years. Except as provided in paragraph (2), a transfer of any voluntary contractual assessments under this subdivision shall be treated as a true and absolute transfer of the asset so transferred for the period of the transfer and not as a pledge or grant of a security interest by the public agency for any borrowing. The characterization of the transfer of any of those assets as an absolute transfer by the public agency shall not be negated or adversely affected by the fact that only a portion of any voluntary contractual assessment is transferred, nor by any characterization of the transferee for purposes of accounting, taxation, or securities regulation, nor by any other factor whatsoever. As used in this section, “transfer” means sale, assignment, or other transfer.

(2) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to authorize the transferee to initiate and prosecute a foreclosure action resulting from a delinquency in the payment of the voluntary contractual assessment. Initiation and prosecution of a foreclosure action shall remain the responsibility of the public agency, which shall retain the sole right to enforce its senior lien status.

(c) Division 10 (commencing with Section 8500) shall apply to any bonds issued pursuant to this section, insofar as that division is not in conflict with this chapter. Notwithstanding Part 16 (commencing with Section 8880) of Division 10, if any reserve fund is established in whole or in part with legally available moneys of one or more public agencies other than bond proceeds, the public agency or agencies may provide that a property owner who prepays all or a portion of the assessment shall not be credited with the public agency moneys in the reserve fund and there shall be no reduction in the assessment pursuant to Sections 8884 or 8881, and the public agency moneys in the reserve account shall not be used to redeem bonds pursuant to Section 8885 and any public agency moneys remaining in the reserve fund at the maturity of the bonds shall be disbursed to the public agency free and clear of the lien of the issuing instrument. Any excess bond proceeds may be used to pay principal of and interest on the bonds in addition to any other use permitted by Division 10 (commencing with Section 8500).

(d) Notwithstanding any other law, the public agency may conclude that it is in the public interest for bonds issued by the public agency pursuant to this chapter to not be subject to redemption prior to their scheduled maturity date except as a result of the prepayment in whole or in part of contractual assessments. Notwithstanding any other limitations set forth in law, and with respect to bonds issued to finance improvements to nonresidential property or residential property with four or more units, the redemption premium associated with a redemption of bonds as a result of a contractual assessment prepayment shall be determined by agreement of the public agency issuing the bonds, the property owner, and the initial purchaser of the bonds.

(e) (1) Without the prior written approval of the property owner, and notwithstanding any other law, a public agency may issue bonds pursuant to this chapter to refinance outstanding bonds payable from contractual assessments levied pursuant to this chapter if all of the following are true:

(A) The total interest cost to maturity on the refunding bonds is less than the total interest cost to maturity on the bonds to be refunded.

(B) The final maturity date of the refunding bonds is not later than the final maturity date of the refunded bonds, except that if the bonds to be refunded are variable rate bonds, the final maturity date of the refunding bonds may extend to, but not beyond, the useful life of the financed improvements.

(C) The total interest component of the scheduled contractual assessment installments to maturity, after issuance of the refunding bonds, is less than the total interest component of the scheduled contractual assessment installments to maturity prior to issuance of the refunding bonds.

(2) For purposes of this section, in connection with the issuance of fixed rate bonds to refinance variable rate bonds, the interest rate on the refunded bonds for purpose of demonstrating compliance with this section may be assumed to be the maximum possible interest rate on the bonds to be refunded as long as the legislative body concludes that the public interest will be served by issuing fixed rate bonds to refinance the outstanding variable rate bonds. In connection with an issuance of refunding bonds under this chapter, the legislative body may direct that an amendment to the document required by subdivision (d) of Section 5898.24 be recorded to reflect the revised contractual assessment installment schedule.

(f) With the prior written approval of the owner of nonresidential property or residential property with four or more units, and notwithstanding any other law, a public agency may issue bonds pursuant to this chapter to refinance outstanding bonds payable from contractual assessments levied pursuant to this chapter without complying with subdivision (e). The final maturity date of the refunding bonds issued pursuant to this subdivision may be later than the final maturity date of the bonds being refunded as long as the final maturity date of the refunding bonds does not extend beyond the useful life of the financed improvements. 



######### 5898.30.  
Assessments levied pursuant to this chapter, and the interest and any penalties thereon shall constitute a lien against the lots and parcels of land on which they are made, until they are paid. Division 10 (commencing with Section 8500), insofar as those provisions are not in conflict with this chapter, Article 13 (commencing with Section 53930) of, and Article 13.5 (commencing with Section 53938) of, Chapter 4 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code apply to the imposition and collection of assessments contracted for pursuant to this chapter, including, but not limited to, provisions related to lien priority, the collection of assessments in the same manner and at the same time as the general taxes of the city or county on real property, unless another procedure has been authorized by the legislative body or by statute, and any penalties and remedies in the event of delinquency and default.



######### 5898.31.  
Since contractual assessments on real property under this chapter are voluntary and imposed pursuant to an agreement with an assessed property owner, the Legislature finds and declares that voluntary contractual assessments under this chapter are not assessments for the purposes of Articles XIII C and XIII D of the California Constitution and therefore the provisions of Articles XIII C and XIII D and Article 4.6 (commencing with Section 53750) of Chapter 4 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code are not applicable to voluntary contractual assessments levied pursuant to this chapter.



######### 5898.32.  
The legislative body shall direct its clerk to record a notice of the existence and amount of each contractual assessment with the county recorder of the county in which the lot or parcel is located. The county recorder shall accept those filings and may charge the clerk a fee for recording those documents pursuant to Section 3116. The failure of the clerk or recorder to perform the filings shall not subject the local agency or any of its officers or employees to civil liability.



######### 5898.33.  
(a) If a public agency owning property, including property held in trust for any beneficiary, grants a leasehold or other possessory interest in the property, the contractual assessment may be levied on the leasehold or possessory interest and shall be payable by the owner of the leasehold or possessory interest. The assessment contract shall be entered into by the public agency that established the program and the lessee, and the public agency owning the property shall provide prior written consent to the contractual assessment.

(b) At the time the assessment contract is executed, the term of the leasehold interest shall be at least as long as the term of the assessment contract.

(c) If the contractual assessment on any possessory interest levied pursuant to subdivision (a) is unpaid when due, the tax collector may use those collection procedures that are available for the collection of assessments on the unsecured roll.



######### 5899.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(1) It is the intent of the Legislature to address seismic safety needs throughout this state by permitting voluntary individual efforts to improve the seismic safety of homes and buildings. The Legislature further intends that this chapter should be used to finance the installation of seismic strengthening improvements that are permanently fixed to residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property, including, but not limited to, the seismic strengthening of cripple walls and sill plate anchorage of light, wood-framed buildings. 

(2) The upfront cost of making residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property more seismically safe prevents many property owners from making those improvements. To make those improvements more affordable and to promote the installation of those strengthening improvements, it is necessary to authorize an alternative procedure for authorizing assessments to finance the cost of seismic strengthening improvements. 

(3) A public purpose will be served by a voluntary contractual assessment program that provides the legislative body of any public agency with the authority to finance the installation of seismic strengthening improvements that are permanently fixed to residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property. 

(b) For purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

(2) “Seismic strengthening improvements” means permanent seismic safety improvements fixed to residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property. 

(c) The legislative body of any public agency may designate an area, in the manner provided pursuant to Section 5898.20, within which authorized public agency officials and property owners may enter into voluntary contractual assessments to finance the installation of seismic strengthening improvements that are permanently fixed to real property pursuant to this chapter. 

(d) For purposes of establishing a voluntary contractual assessment program relating to seismic strengthening improvements, the legislative body shall make the determinations required pursuant to Section 5898.20 by adopting a resolution indicating its intention to do so. The resolution of intention shall identify the kinds of seismic strengthening improvements that may be financed and shall include all of the information that is required pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 5898.20, including, but not limited to, directing an appropriate public agency official to prepare a report pursuant to Section 5898.22. 

(e) For purposes of the report required pursuant to Section 5898.22, relating to a voluntary contractual assessment program for seismic strengthening improvements, the designated public agency official shall satisfy the requirements of paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 5898.22 by identifying the types of seismic strengthening improvements that may be financed through the use of contractual assessments.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon the written consent of an authorized public agency official, the proposed arrangements for financing the program pertaining to the installation of seismic strengthening improvements that are permanently fixed to real property may authorize the property owner to purchase directly the related equipment and materials for the installation of seismic strengthening improvements and to contract directly for the installation of seismic strengthening improvements that are permanently fixed to the property owner’s residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property. 



######### 5899.2.  
For the purpose of financing the installation of distributed generation renewable energy sources pursuant to this chapter, “permanently fixed” includes, but is not limited to, systems attached to a residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property pursuant to a power purchase agreement or lease between the owner of the system and the owner of the assessed property, if the power purchase agreement or lease contains all of the following provisions:

(a) The attached system is an eligible renewable energy resource pursuant to the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program (Article 16 (commencing with Section 399.11) of Chapter 2.3 of Part 1 of Division 1 of the Public Utilities Code).

(b) The term of the power purchase agreement or lease is at least as long as the term of the related assessment contract.

(c) The owner of the attached system agrees to install, maintain, and monitor the system for the entire term of the power purchase agreement or lease.

(e) After installation, the power purchase agreement or lease is paid, either partially or in full, using the funds from the contractual assessment program.

(f) The right to receive the electricity from the system, through a power purchase agreement or lease or the right to the system itself, is tied to the ownership of the assessed real property and is required to be automatically transferred with the title to the real property whether the title is transferred by voluntary sale, judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure, or by any other means.

(g) The power purchase agreement or lease identifies the public agency that is a party to the assessment contract on the real property as a third-party beneficiary of the power purchase agreement or lease until the assessment lien on the property has been fully paid and, only until that time, prohibits amendments to the power purchase agreement or lease without the consent of the public agency.

(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(1) This chapter should be used to finance the installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure that is permanently fixed to residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property. 

(2) Electric vehicle charging infrastructure is a necessary component to transitioning to increase electric vehicle usage. Electric vehicles and their electric charging infrastructure also address the issue of global climate change. 

(3) The upfront cost of installing electric vehicle charging infrastructure improvements for residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property prevents many property owners from making those improvements. To make those improvements more affordable and to promote the installation of those improvements, it is necessary to authorize an alternative procedure for authorizing assessments to finance the cost of installing electric vehicle charging infrastructure. 

(4) The Legislature declares that a public purpose will be served by a voluntary contractual assessment program that provides the legislative body of a public agency with the authority to finance the installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure that is permanently fixed to residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon the written consent of an authorized public agency official, the proposed arrangements for financing the program pertaining to the installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure that is permanently fixed to real property may authorize the property owner to purchase directly the related equipment and materials for the installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure and to contract directly for the installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure that is permanently fixed to the property owner’s residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property. 



######### 5899.4.  
(a) (1) It is the intent of the Legislature to provide homeowners and businesses with an affordable way to finance improvements to their homes and buildings that make those facilities more resistant to wildfire by permitting voluntary individual efforts to improve the wildfire resilience and safety of those facilities. The Legislature further intends that this chapter should be used to finance the installation of wildfire safety improvements that are permanently fixed to residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property.

(2) The upfront cost of making residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property more resistant to wildfire prevents many property owners from making those improvements. To make those improvements more affordable and to promote the installation of wildfire safety improvements, it is necessary to authorize an alternative procedure for authorizing assessments to finance the cost of wildfire safety improvements.

(3) A public purpose will be served by a voluntary contractual assessment program that provides the legislative body of any public agency with the authority to finance the installation of wildfire safety improvements that are permanently fixed to residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property.

(1) For the purpose of financing the installation of wildfire safety improvements, “public agency” means a city, county, or city and county. The definition of “city” in Section 5005 shall not apply to this paragraph. 

(2) “Wildfire safety improvements” means permanent wildfire resilience and safety improvements fixed to existing residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other real property. An improvement within the meaning of this paragraph means any of the components identified by the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection at www.readyforwildfire.org/Hardening-Your-Home/, as updated by the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection or at a subsequent Internet Web site than can be fixed to an existing building or structure. A PACE assessment that finances a wildfire safety improvement shall not be eligible for a waiver of the requirements of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 22687 of the Financial Code pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 22687 of the Financial Code. In order to qualify under this paragraph, a wildfire safety improvement shall be fixed to an existing building or structure, and shall not be used as a part of a project to construct a new home or to rebuild or reconstruct a home that was destroyed or damaged in a fire.

######### 6402.  
If the amount of the unpaid assessment upon any lot or parcel of land is less than one hundred fifty dollars ($150), the assessment shall be collected as provided in Part 3 (commencing with Section 5100) of this division.



######### 6403.  
When the legislative body determines that serial bonds shall be issued to represent the expenses of any proposed work under this division, it shall so declare in the resolution of intention to do the work, and shall specify the rate of interest which the bonds shall bear.



######### 6404.  
Notwithstanding any other provision in this division, the legislative body may sell to any local, State or National public agency or authority authorized to purchase the same, all or any part of any bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this part, or any bonds issued pursuant to the Improvement Bond Act of 1915, upon the security of assessments levied under this division. Any such bonds may be sold to any such public agency or authority without advertisement or bidding, but shall not be sold for less than par. The interest rate on such bonds shall be the rate fixed therefor by the legislative body, but may be for a lesser rate than that so fixed if the legislative body finds a purchaser at such lesser rate. Upon the sale of any such bonds to any such public agency or authority, the purchase price thereof shall be paid to the contractor or his assigns in lieu of the bonds and in satisfaction of the balance due upon the assessment.



######### 6405.  
The legislative body of any city may contract with a specially qualified person, firm or corporation to act as fiscal agent. Such contracts may authorize the fiscal agent to act as agent for any city officer or employee in the performance of any duty required to be performed, or in taking any action authorized to be taken in connection with bonds issued pursuant to this part.








##### CHAPTER 2. Issuance of Bonds [6420 - 6427]  

######### 6420.  
After the full expiration of 30 days from the date of the recordation of the warrant, and after the filing of the written statement of all payments received by the contractor or his assignees upon the assessment, the street superintendent shall make and certify to the treasurer a complete list of all assessments unpaid, which amount to one hundred fifty dollars ($150) or over, upon any assessment or diagram number.



######### 6421.  
If any person, or his authorized agent, shall at any time before the thirty-first day after the recordation of the warrant present to the treasurer the following:

(a) His affidavit stating that he is the owner of a lot or parcel of land in the list,

(b) The certificate of a searcher of records that he is such owner of record, and

(c) A notice to the treasurer stating that he desires no bond to be issued for the assessments upon his lot or parcel of land, then no such bond shall be issued therefor, and the payee of the warrant, or his assigns, shall retain his right to enforce collection as if the lot or parcel of land had not been so listed by the street superintendent.



######### 6422.  
The treasurer shall upon the filing of the list, make out, sign, and issue to the contractor, or other person entitled to the proceeds of the warrant and assessment, a separate bond, representing upon each lot or parcel of land, including each condominium interest as defined in Section 783 of the Civil Code, upon the list the total amount of the assessment against the same, as thereon shown.



######### 6423.  
If a lot or parcel of land is described upon the assessment and diagram by its number or block, or both, and is also designated by its number or block, or both, upon the official map of the city, or upon any map on file in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the lot or parcel of land is situated, it shall be a sufficient description of the lot or parcel of land in the bond to designate it by the number or block, or both, as it appears on the official or recorded map.



######### 6424.  
The bonds and interest thereon shall be paid at the office of the treasurer, who shall keep a fund designated by the name of the bonds, into which he shall place all sums paid him for the principal of the bonds and the interest thereon, together with all penalties thereon, and from which he shall disburse such sums, upon the presentation of proper coupons. Under no circumstances shall the bonds or the interest thereon be paid out of any other fund.



######### 6425.  
The treasurer shall keep a register in his office, showing the series, number, date, amount, rate of interest, payee and indorsees of each bond, and the number and amount of each coupon or principal or interest paid by him and shall cancel and file each coupon so paid.



######### 6426.  
If any officer whose signature or countersignature appears on any bond or coupon ceases to be such officer before delivery of the bonds to the purchaser thereof, the signature or countersignature appearing either on the bonds or on the coupons, or both, shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such officer had remained in office until the delivery of such bonds.



######### 6427.  
Bonds issued pursuant to this part shall by their issuance be conclusive evidence of the regularity of all proceedings under this division leading up to such issuance.








##### CHAPTER 3. Payments on Assessments at Bond [6440 - 6449]  

######### 6440.  
After the street superintendent files his list of unpaid assessments with the treasurer, the principal of each unpaid assessment shall thereafter become due and payable to the treasurer in equal annual payments on each October 15th succeeding the September 1st following the date of the bonds until fully paid. The number of annual payments shall correspond to the number of serial payments to be made on the principal of the bonds issued to represent the unpaid assessment.



######### 6441.  
The first interest payment on the unpaid assessment shall be payable to the treasurer on the April 15th next succeeding the March 1st or the October 15th next succeeding the September 1st, as the case may be, next following the date of the bonds. The following interest payments shall each be for six months interest and shall be payable to the treasurer on each fifteenth day of April and October, the last interest payment coming due the October 15th immediately preceding the last annual payment of the principal of the bonds issued to represent the unpaid assessment.



######### 6441.1.  
If a remittance to cover a payment of interest or interest and principal to be made to the treasurer prior to a certain date and hour or prior to a certain date before being delinquent is sent through the United States mail, properly addressed with postage prepaid, and the cancellation mark is placed on the evelope after it is deposited in the mail:

(a) Where the cancellation mark shows both date and time, the remittance shall be deemed received on the date shown by the cancellation mark and by the time specified by law for that date.

(b) Where the cancellation mark shows only the date, the remittance shall be deemed received within the time and date specified when the cancellation mark bears a date on or before which payment is required.

The treasurer need not accept such a payment if it is received more than 10 days after the date and time set by law for the payment.  This section shall not apply if the letter containing the payment was incorrectly addressed.



######### 6442.  
If any installment of the principal of the unpaid assessment or of interest thereon is not paid to the treasurer on or before the due date of June 1st or December 1st, as the case may be, next preceding the date upon which the coupons representing it are payable to the bondholder, the treasurer shall, after the close of business on the due date, add to the principal or interest so delinquent a penalty of 2 percent of the total amount of such delinquency, and at the beginning of the business on the first day of each succeeding month until such delinquent payment and all penalties thereon are fully paid, he shall add an additional penalty of 2 percent of the amount of such delinquency. The treasurer shall collect such penalties with and as a part of the delinquent payment. Except as hereinafter provided, the 2-percent penalty first imposed and all subsequent penalties shall be paid to the holder of the bond along with and as a part of such defaulted payment. The legislative body conducting the proceedings may elect, in the resolution of intention, to have the treasurer retain the first 2-percent penalty as a cost of servicing the delinquency. In such case, the following sentence shall be substituted for the last sentence of the default clause in the bond form, as set forth in Section 6460: “The 2-percent penalty first imposed shall be retained by the treasurer as a cost of servicing the delinquency and all subsequent penalties shall be paid to the holder of the bond along with and as a part of such defaulted payment.”



######### 6443.  
At least 15 days before each respective 15th day of April and October, until the assessment is paid in full, the treasurer shall mail, postage prepaid, to each owner of property described in the assessment, at his last known address, as appears upon the tax rolls current at the time of mailing, a postal card notifying him of the amount due and the date when payment is due from him on the assessment and statng that the payment is subject to penalty if not paid on or prior to the due date. The failure of the treasurer to mail the card, or the failure of the property owner to receive it, shall not affect the validity of any penalty or invalidate any act or proceeding. The card shall contain the following in at least 14-point boldface type:

If you do not pay this bill, at the request of the bondholder, your property will be sold by the treasurer.

This bill is not related in any way to your property tax bill.  It must be paid separately.



######### 6444.  
The treasurer may accept payments of installments of interest unaccompanied by payments of installments of principal which are due. The acceptance of such interest payments shall not effect the delinquent status of any installments of principal.



######### 6445.  
The treasurer shall, in addition to his other duties, keep a record of all bonds issued by him, of all payments on the bonds with the dates thereof and of all penalties accruing thereon.



######### 6446.  
The assessment shall be a lien upon the property affected thereby, with priority as fixed in Section 5373, until the bond issued to represent the assessment and which it is hereby declared does represent the assessement, and the accrued interest thereon and the penalties, if any, shall be fully paid according to the terms thereof, but which lien shall in no event continue beyond four years after the date of the last principal coupon attached thereto, and for the purposes of Section 330 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Section 2911 of the Civil Code said date shall be deemed the “due date” of the last principal coupon attached to said bonds.



######### 6447.  
The owner of or any person interested in any lot or parcel of land upon which a bond has been issued under the terms of this division may at any time before commencement of proceedings for sale pay off the bond and discharge the land described in the bond from the lien of the assessment. The discharge may be had by paying to the treasurer, for the holder of the bond, the following sums: (a) the unpaid principal sum thereof; (b) if the interest thereon has already been paid to the next succeeding January 2 or July 2, as the case may be, no interest will be payable; (c) if the interest to the next succeeding January 2 or July 2 has not been paid, then the interest to that January 2 or July 2, as the case may be, shall be payable; (d) all penalties accrued and unpaid; and (e) premium, if any, required by Section 6464. For the purpose of this section, a bond shall be deemed to be issued on the 31st day after the recordation of the warrant upon any unpaid assessment for which the legislative body has provided for the issuance of a bond to represent said unpaid assessment or the last date for payment of the assessment, as specified in the statement required by Section 5390, whichever may be later.



######### 6448.  
When all payments on a bond are made to the treasurer, he shall enter the same in his record of the bond and the lien of the assessment shall cease.

The treasurer shall forthwith notify the holder of the bond and call in the bond.  When the bond has been presented and paid the treasurer shall enter in his record thereof the amount paid and the date of payment to the holder and shall cancel the bond and file it in his office.



######### 6449.  
Whenever a school district acquires property subject to a bond or bonds issued under the terms of this division for unpaid assessments against said property, the district may include in its annual tax levy, in addition to moneys for all other purposes, an amount sufficient to pay the annual payments of principal and interest due on said bond or bonds. Said tax levy may be made notwithstanding that the said tax levy exceeds the maximum tax rate which may otherwise be imposed by law. No school district shall levy the tax authorized by this section for a period in excess of five years with respect to a particular parcel of property.

This bond is issued to represent the cost of certain public improvements benefiting such public property, which property is more fully described as assessment number(s) ____ in an assessment issued by the street superintendent of said ____ and recorded in the superintendent’s office.

Said assessment was levied on the ____ day of ____ 20__, in an assessment district known and described as “____”; notice thereof was recorded in the office of the County Recorder of the County of ____, on the ____ day of ____ 20__.

This bond is one of several bonds of like date, tenor and effect, but differing in amounts and maturities, issued by said city (or county) under said law for the purpose of providing means for paying for the work and improvements described in the resolution of intention in the assessment district proceedings hereinabove referred to, and to represent an unpaid assessment against publicly owned property. It is secured by the moneys in said redemption fund and by the unpaid amount of said assessment against said publicly owned property, and, including principal and interest is payable exclusively from said redemption fund and neither the (here insert city or county) nor any officer thereof is to be liable for payment otherwise.

The officer, officers, or board of the entity assessed whose duty it is to levy taxes, is obligated to include in the tax levy for each and every fiscal year of the period of the bonds of the series of which this bond is a part, an amount, in addition to moneys for all other purposes, sufficient to pay the interest falling due on all bonds outstanding of this series, plus the amount necessary to pay the principal of all bonds falling due each fiscal year of the life of this series of bonds. This levy shall be included each fiscal year during the life of this series of bonds, and until the principal and interest upon all bonds of this series shall be paid in full. The levy shall be in addition to any levy or levies made for all other purposes, and shall be made notwithstanding that the tax levy exceeds the maximum tax rate that may otherwise be imposed by law.

The Treasurer of the City (County) of ____ will on the second day of June 20__, solely out of said redemption fund, pay to the bearer the sum of ____ dollars ($____) with interest thereon from the ____ day of ____ 20__, at the rate of ____ percent per annum, all as herein specified and at the office of the treasurer of said city (county).

The interest is payable semiannually, to wit: on the second day of December and June of each fiscal year after the date of this bond, upon presentation of the proper coupons therefor; provided, that the first of said coupons is for interest to the second day of December, 20__, and thereafter the interest coupons are for the semiannual interest. The term “fiscal year” is defined to mean the period from July 1st to and including June 30th of the year following throughout the life of this series of bonds, the first of which fiscal years shall commence the July 1st following the date of this bond. This bond will continue to bear interest after maturity at the rate above stated; provided, it is presented at maturity and payment thereof is refused upon the sole ground that there is not sufficient moneys in said redemption fund with which to pay same. If it is not presented at maturity, interest thereon will run until maturity.

In the event the officer or board whose duty it is to levy taxes to pay for said bonds fails to provide for a tax levy to pay and discharge the principal of the bonds and the interest thereon, the owner of this bond may compel the levy thereof in the manner hereinafter set forth by writ of mandate. The writ of mandate shall include the right to compel the levy of an amount sufficient to pay principal and interest on all bonds issued to represent the same assessment.

The owner of this bond may use mandamus or other appropriate remedy to compel the officer or board, whose duty it is to levy taxes for said obligated owner, to levy an amount in a given year equal to the amount necessary to pay principal and interest on the unpaid portion of this series of bonds and may continue to use mandamus or other remedy to cause a like amount of principal and interest to be levied each year until the whole of the assessment and this series of bonds and all interest thereon has been paid.

If the owner of this bond is successful in any action to compel the levy of the tax under this bond the owner shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees as fixed by the court, and costs, and said attorney fees and costs shall be included in the tax levied to pay the same.

This bond may be redeemed and paid in advance of maturity upon the second day of December or June in any year by giving notice in the manner provided for giving of notice for redemption of bonds under the provisions of the Improvement Bond Act of 1915, and by paying principal and accrued interest together with a premium equal to ____ percent of the principal.

If the legislative body determines that the fee set forth above is not sufficient to reimburse the city for the necessary administrative costs in processing applications under this chapter, the legislative body by resolution may fix a fee in an amount that will reimburse the city for the necessary costs in processing applications under this chapter. The street superintendent shall deposit all of these fees in the treasury.



######### 6482.  
Upon receipt of the application and fee the street superintendent shall apportion to each separate part of the original lot or parcel of land the proportionate part of the amount remaining unpaid on the assessment that would have been levied thereon had the lot or parcel of land been so divided at the time the original assessment was made, or shall apportion to each combined parcel the proportionate part of the amount remaining unpaid on the assessment that would have been levied thereon had the parcel been so combined at the time the original assessment was made.



######### 6483.  
When the apportionment has been made an application signed by all persons owning an interest in the original lot or parcel or lots or parcels of land and by the holder of the existing bond on the lot or parcel of land or lots or parcels may be filed with the treasurer requesting that new bonds be issued for the amounts shown by the apportioned assessment. The application shall be accompanied by evidence satisfactory to the treasurer that it is signed by all of the necessary persons.



######### 6484.  
When the treasurer has ascertained that the application is signed by all the necessary persons he or she shall so advise the street superintendent.

######### 6490.5.  
The legislative body may provide in the resolution of intention, along with its determination to issue bonds, that the bonds shall be divisible pursuant to this chapter. This chapter shall apply only if it is clearly stated on the bond that it is divisible pursuant to this chapter.



######### 6491.  
(a) If any lot or parcel of land upon which there is an unpaid assessment represented by bonds issued under this division and to which this chapter is applicable is subdivided, including a division into condominium interests as defined in Section 783 of the Civil Code, or the ownership of a portion of the lot or parcel of land is transferred to another person, the owner of any interest in any of the lots or parcels into which the original lot or parcel has been divided, may file an application in writing with the legislative body.

(b) The application under subdivision (a) shall indicate how the original lot or parcel has been divided or transferred, and request the legislative body to apportion the amount remaining unpaid on the assessment in accordance with this chapter.

(c) The application shall be accompanied by a fee in an amount to be determined by the legislative body, for each separate part or parcel of land into which the original lot or parcel has been divided or transferred.  All application fees shall be deposited in the treasury.



######### 6491.5.  
Upon receipt of the application and fee, the street superintendent shall determine, or cause to be determined, an apportionment of the unpaid assessment to each separate part of the original lot or parcel of land, as if the lot or parcel of land had been so divided at the time the original assessment was made.



######### 6492.  
After the apportionment has been determined pursuant to Section 6491.5, an application signed by all persons owning an interest in the original lot or parcel of land may be filed with the legislative body, requesting that the assessment as apportioned be adopted.



######### 6492.5.  
(a) The clerk of the legislative body shall send a notice, by certified or registered mail, to the registered holder of any outstanding bond secured by the assessment to be apportioned, stating that an apportionment of an assessment has been requested, and indicating the numbers and amounts of the proposed apportionment.  The notice shall also state that, unless a request for a hearing is received within 45 days from the date of mailing of the notice, the apportioned assessments shall become final and be recorded in the office of the street superintendent.

(b) If a request for a hearing under subdivision (a) is received, the legislative body shall file a report and conduct a hearing pursuant to Part 10 (commencing with Section 8730) of Division 10.

(a) At the time and place set for the hearing pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 6492.5, and after hearing all protests, the legislative body may determine to divide the bond according to the proposed apportionment, or as amended by the legislative body during the hearing, upon a finding of both of the following:

(1) That the apportionment is in accordance with the proportionate benefits to be received by each of the resulting lots or parcels.

(2) That the apportionment does not impair the value or security of the outstanding bonds secured by the land being apportioned  and that the lien-to-value ratio of each apportioned parcel is not less than that ratio for the original parcel based on an appraisal by an individual designated by a nationally recognized appraisal association.  The value calculations shall exclude site improvements constructed subsequent to the date of confirmation of the assessment.

(b) The determination of the legislative body pursuant to subdivision (a) is final and conclusive.

(c) Upon that determination, the bond secured by the original parcel shall be returned by the bondholder, canceled on the books of the city, and exchanged for new bonds on the apportioned parcels in the same aggregate principal amount, of the same maturity, and at the same interest rate as the original bond. Thereafter, payment of principal and interest shall be due on the new bonds to the holder thereof in the same manner and on the same dates as were applicable to the original bond.



######### 6493.5.  
(a) If the clerk of the legislative body ascertains that the application has been signed by all of the necessary persons, and that no request for a hearing has been received, the clerk shall amend, or cause to be amended, the recorded diagram and assessment to conform to the proposed division and apportionment, and assign new assessment numbers to each separate part of the original lot or parcel of land.

(b) The clerk of the legislative body shall file the amended assessment with the treasurer, who shall annually enter upon the assessment roll the installments becoming due on each component part of the original parcel opposite a description of the respective parcels.



######### 6494.  
If a city is the legislative body proceeding pursuant to this chapter and collections upon the assessments are made by county officials, the street superintendent shall transmit a copy of the amended assessment to the county treasurer.








##### CHAPTER 6. Default and Sale for Delinquency [6500 - 6518]

If the holder of the bond has complied with subdivision (b) and deposits the required amounts, the treasurer shall proceed to advertise and sell the lot or parcel of land as provided in this chapter.

The treasurer may require the holder of the bond to deposit with him an amount of money estimated by the treasurer to be sufficient to reimburse the city for costs incurred in obtaining an abstract of title or title search of the real property to be sold, if the treasurer deems it necessary to determine ownership of the property. Amounts deposited which remain after these expenses have been paid shall be returned to the depositor or his representative.

(b) At least 30 days prior to demanding a sale by the treasurer for nonpayment of either principal or interest upon any delinquent bond on owner-occupied residential property, a bondholder shall send a notice by first-class mail, postage prepaid, of the delinquent amount along with the following notice to the owner of the property.

However, if the owner of the property has not been personally served at the end of 60 days after posting the notice required by this section, and if reasonable diligence has been used to find and serve the owner, the notices mailed and posted pursuant to this section shall be deemed adequate service. In such a case, the notice requirements of this section shall be deemed complied with upon the execution of the treasurer of a certificate stating the nature of the efforts made to personally serve the owner and that the owner cannot, with reasonable diligence, be so served. At the time of making such request, the purchaser or his assignee shall pay to the teasurer the following sums:

(i) For issuance of the notice and mailing the same by certified mail and for cost of preparation of the affidavit required by Section 6552, the sum of three dollars ($3).

Such notice shall be mailed at least 60 days before the expiration of the time for redemption, or 60 days before the purchaser applies for a deed.  The treasurer also shall post a copy of such notice in a conspicuous place upon the property, if a survey is not required to identify and locate the property.

The owner of the property shall have the right of redemption until such notice is given and the deed applied for, upon the payment of the fees, penalties and costs as required, or if no deed is applied for, until four years after the date of the issuance of the certificate of sale at which time the certificate of sale would be conclusively presumed to be redeemed.



######### 6552.  
No deed to the property sold shall be issued by the treasurer to the purchaser until the treasurer has filed for the record an affidavit showing that the required notices have been given. The affidavit shall be filed and preserved by the treasurer with other records kept by him in his office.

If the property is not redeemed within the time allowed the treasurer shall upon application of the purchaser or his assignee make a deed to the property, reciting in the deed substantially the matter contained in the certificate of sale, and that no person has redeemed the property during the time allowed for its redemption. The treasurer shall be entitled to receive seven dollars ($7) from the purchaser for making the deed. All money so received by the treasurer shall be deposited in the treasury for the use of the city after payment has been made therefrom for the acknowledgement of the deed.



######### 6555.  
The deed of the treasurer, when duly acknowledged or proved, is primary evidence of the regularity of all proceedings theretofore had, and conveys to the grantee the absolute title to the lands described therein, as of the date of the expiration of the period for redemption, free of all encumbrances, except:

If the superintendent of streets of another city, as city is defined in Section 5005, has issued subordinate assessments, as defined by Section 5373, against the same property upon which such treasurer’s deed was issued, then the superintendent of streets shall cancel the subordinate assessments and enter upon the assessment roll the notation “canceled by foreclosure of prior lien,” provided that he is notified of the issuance of the deed by the owner of the deed.

If the treasurer has issued subordinate bonds, as defined by Section 5373, against the same property upon which the treasurer’s deed is issued, then the treasurer shall cancel the subordinate bonds, and enter upon the bond register the notation “canceled by foreclosure of prior lien.” If the superintendent of streets has issued subordinate assessments, as defined by Section 5373, against the same property upon which such treasurer’s deed is issued, then the superintendent of streets shall cancel the subordinate assessments and enter upon the assessment roll the notation “canceled by foreclosure of prior lien,” provided that he is notified of the issuance of the treasurer’s deed by either the treasurer or the owner of the deed.



######### 6556.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the purchaser of owner-occupied residential property at a sale under Section 6509, or an assignee or transferee of the purchaser, has not applied for the deed to the property and recorded the deed in the office of the county recorder in which the property lies, within 16 months of the date of issuance of the certificate of sale, the certificate of sale and the deed are void and neither the certificate of sale nor the deed shall have any legal effect.

This section shall apply to sales held after the effective date of this section.








##### CHAPTER 9. Contesting Validity of Sales and Deeds for Delinquency [6570 - 6572]  

######### 6570.  
Within 60 days after the sale of the property for delinquency, the purchaser may send to the person to whom the property is assessed for purposes of taxation as shown upon the last equalized assessment roll of the county in which the property lies, and to the person in whose name, on the date the sale is made, the legal title to the property appears by deed duly recorded in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the property lies, by registered mail and first-class mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the certificate of sale. Together with the copy of the certificate of sale, a notice shall be sent that is printed in at least 14-point boldface type in the following form:
 YOUR PROPERTY HAS BEEN SOLD


Your property located at ____ has been sold by the treasurer’s office of the city (or county) for nonpayment of ____ improvement assessment.

You have one year from the date this notice was mailed to contest the validity of the sale. 

If a copy of the certificate of sale is sent as provided in this section, no action, suit, or proceeding to set aside, cancel, or in any manner attack or question the validity of any sale for delinquency, or any proceedings prior thereto, shall be commenced or maintained by any person unless the same shall be commenced within one year after the date the above notice was mailed.  After the year has expired, all persons shall be barred from commencing or prosecuting any such action, suit, or proceeding, and any and all persons shall be barred from asserting or maintaining in any action, suit, or proceeding that the sale, or any proceedings prior thereto, was invalid.



######### 6571.  
Any action, suit, or proceeding attacking or contesting the validity of any deed issued under the provisions of this division, or the validity of the proceedings subsequent to the issuance of the certificate of sale, shall be brought within 12 months after the issuance of the deed, and if the validity of the deed or of the proceedings is not contested within that 12 months’ period, it shall not be thereafter contested or questioned in any action, suit, or proceeding, except that an action, suit, or proceeding with respect to any deed of owner-occupied residential property may be brought within 12 months after discovery of the issuance of the deed or, for owner-occupied residential property sold between January 1, 1969, and January 1, 1979, within 12 months after the enactment of the amendments to this section made during the 1981–82 Regular Session of the Legislature.

A defense to a proceeding pursuant to this section shall be that the current owner of record is a bona fide purchaser for value.

The Legislature finds and declares that the court of appeal in Atkins v. Kessler, 97 Cal. App. 3d 784, held that under the former provisions of this division the statute of limitations in this section could not be raised against an owner in possession of residential real property during the entire period of delinquency and sale because due process was violated.  It is therefore the intent of the Legislature that the amendments to this section made during the 1981–82 Regular Session of the Legislature shall be applied retrospectively with respect to any owners in possession of residential real property during the entire period of delinquency and at the time of the sale whose homes were sold pursuant to this act between January 1, 1969, and January 1, 1979.



######### 6572.  
If any sale of lands for delinquency in the payment of principal or interest of any bond is held illegal or invalid, or any deed issued to the purchaser at any such sale is held illegal or invalid for any reason whatsoever, the lands described in the bond shall not be released from the lien of the assessment but shall be and remain subject to further proceedings for the enforcement of the assessment, and the further proceedings may include additional sales or the issuance of new deeds. In any event, however, the lien of the assessment shall continue only until a valid sale is had and a valid deed issued, or until the expiration of two years after such sale or deed is held illegal or invalid, whichever is sooner.








##### CHAPTER 11. Foreclosure of Bond Lien [6610 - 6623]  

######### 6610.  
As a separate, distinct and cumulative remedy, the holder of any bond upon which any payment either upon the principal or of the interest has become delinquent may, if the city which initiated the proceedings is not a county, at any time after three months after the date it is provided by ordinance or charter of the city that taxes are due, or if a county initiated the proceedings or collects the taxes for the city at any time after four months next succeeding the fourth Monday of September, following the date of delinquency of principal or interest and prior to the expiration of four years after the due date of the last installment upon any bond or of the last principal coupon attached thereto, file and maintain an action to foreclose the lien of the bond and recover the amount due thereon.

No action shall be commenced pursuant to this section until the expiration of 15 days after a notice containing the amount of the payment due, the date the payment is or was due, penalties which may accrue for failure to pay, and notice of the foreclosure action which may occur if payment is not made is mailed, postage prepaid and registered, by the bondholder, or his representative, to the owner of the property at his last known address as it appears on the tax rolls.



######### 6611.  
The action may be brought also at any time following the expiration of 30 days after the service of personal demand for payment upon the owner of the premises. Such demand shall be served in the manner provided by law for the service of a summons in a civil action. If the action is brought costs for the service of the demand shall be allowed in an amount equivalent to the fees prescribed by law for the service of summons.

The demand shall be in substantially the following form: 

“Demand for Payment of Street Improvement Bond

You are hereby notified that Bond No. ____ Series No. ____ for an improvement in the City (or County) of ____ is delinquent. Unless the amount of the unpaid principal on said bond together with interest and penalties is paid to the city (or county) treasurer on or before 30 days after the service on you of this demand, the date of such service being this ____ day of ____, 20__, the undersigned will institute suit to foreclose the lien of said bond in the manner prescribed by law.” 



######### 6612.  
The action shall be brought in the superior court of the county in which the proceedings were initiated and if the owner of the lot or parcel of land covered by the bond can not with due diligence be found, the service of summons in such action may be had in the manner prescribed by law.



######### 6613.  
The complaint in the action shall be sufficient if it sets forth a true copy of the bond and makes appropriate allegations regarding the payments made upon the principal and interest of the bond and the mailing of the notice required pursuant to Section 6610. If personal demand for payment is made the complaint shall so allege.



######### 6614.  
The bond, together with proof, either orally by the treasurer or by a certificate signed by him showing the nonpayment of any of the principal or interest upon the bond, shall be prima facie evidence of the right of the plaintiff to recover in the action. If personal demand for payment was made, proof of personal service of the demand shall be required.



######### 6615.  
The court may adjudge and decree a lien against the lot or parcel of land covered by the bond and cause the premises to be sold as in other cases of the sale of real estate by the process of the court to satisfy and discharge the bond and lien, and the amount of interest and penalties due shall be calculated at the rates and in the manner specified in this part for such calculation of interest and penalties, and shall be calculated and allowed up to the date of judgment. The court having jurisdiction of the action shall also fix and allow a reasonable attorney’s fee for the prosecution of the action.



######### 6616.  
The plaintiff in the action may also recover the actual cost of any abstract or report of search of title procured in good faith, in order to determine ownership, if it is made by a reputable abstracter or title company, if the abstract or report of search with an affidavit of payment is filed in the action.



######### 6618.  
The action shall be governed and regulated by the provisions of this chapter and by the other provisions of law which are not in conflict herewith.



######### 6619.  
A written notice of the pendency of any action for recovery on a bond shall be filed with the treasurer. After the filing of such notice the treasurer shall not receive any money on account of the bond and shall have no authority to cancel the entries on the bond in the register or give a discharge of the bond without the written consent of the owner thereof until judgment has been rendered in the action or until it has been dismissed.

Upon the entry of judgment or dismissal of the action the clerk of the court shall forthwith mail to the treasurer a certified copy of the judgment or other evidence sufficient to advise the treasurer of the judgment of the court in the action.



######### 6620.  
If an action is brought for recovery on any bond prior to the time specified in this chapter, the plaintiff shall not recover in such action and the defendant shall be entitled to have and recover such attorney fees as the court deems reasonable, in addition to all taxable costs.



######### 6621.  
Whenever a bond is foreclosed pursuant to this chapter, the decree of foreclosure shall direct the clerk of the court to deliver the bond sued upon to the treasurer of the city which issued said bond together with a memorandum setting forth the title and number of the action and the fact that the bond has been foreclosed.



######### 6622.  
The treasurer shall cancel the bond upon the records and deliver to the clerk of the court a receipt substantially in the following form:

“Certificate of Cancellation of Street Improvement Bond Series (designating it), in the City (or County) of (naming it).


|
$/100

######### 6750.  
None of the provisions of Part 3 of this division relating to protests against the work shall apply to any work undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this part. All of the provisions of Part 3 of this division which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this part shall apply hereto.

The notice shall be delivered to the superintendent of streets within 10 days after the service of the resolution requiring the work.



######### 6785.  
The omission or neglect to make the election by delivering the notice makes the superintendent of streets the agent of the owner of the track with the authority to enter into a contract made in accordance with this chapter and the Public Contract Code for doing the work.

The superintendent of streets shall thereupon be vested with authority to, and he or she shall, advertise for bids for the work and fix in the notice the time for receiving bids which shall be not less than five days from the first publication of the notice.



######### 6794.  
The legislative body, by ordinance, may prescribe and enforce additional regulations and penalties that it deems necessary to compel the doing of the work as provided in this chapter on any portion of any street occupied by any railroad track.

(b) A private easement claimed by reason of the purchase of a lot by reference to a map or plat upon which the street or highway is shown is not extinguished pursuant to subdivision (a) if, within two years after the date the vacation is complete, the claimant records a verified notice that particularly describes the private easement that is claimed in the office of the recorder of the county in which the vacated street or highway is located.

(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to create a private easement, nor to extend a private easement now recognized by law, nor to make the rights of the public in or to a street or highway subordinate to a private easement.  Nothing in this section affects the right of the owner of property that was subject to the vacated street or highway to commence an action to quiet title as against any claim of a private easement of any type, whether before or after recordation of a verified notice pursuant to this section.

(c) The deeds provided for in this section shall not be delivered to the grantees named in the deeds, until good and sufficient conveyances vesting in the local agency the title to the new street or highway opened in lieu of the street or highway vacated are delivered to the local agency.

(d) The authority granted in this section is permissive and does not affect any authority the local agency may have to hold the property for public use, dispose of the property by public bid, or take any other action with respect to the property authorized by law.



######### 8357.

######### 9131.  
The taxes to be appropriated or contributed may be described in the resolution making the appropriation or contribution as all of the taxes for the particular fiscal year or years; and the total amount thereof may be stated in the resolution.

The protest shall specifically set forth the nature thereof. Failure to file such written protest shall be a waiver of any right which such person may have or claim.



######### 9201.  
Any person who files such a protest shall have full opportunity to be heard thereon.



######### 9202.  
At the time and place fixed for hearing, the legislative body shall hear any complaints or objections that may be made concerning the amount of unpaid assessments, or the amounts of proposed reassessments as to any of the parcels of land to be reassessed.



######### 9203.  
At the hearing no objections to the regularity of the proceedings with reference to the making of the improvement or the validity or the amount of any assessment levied in the original proceedings shall be considered. All other objections to any reassessment shall be deemed waived unless presented at the time and in the manner specified in this chapter.



######### 9204.  
The determination of the legislative body upon all objections or protests shall be final and conclusive.



######### 9205.  
The hearing may be continued from time to time by order entered in the minutes, but must be concluded within 30 days from the date orginally fixed.



######### 9206.  
At the hearing the legislative body may review and correct the amount of any reassessments upon any parcel of land, but shall not assess against any parcel of land a greater amount than the total unpaid assessment, with interest and penalties thereon, if any.



######### 9207.  
At the conclusion of the hearing the reassessment as originally made or as reviewed and corrected shall be confirmed by resolution entered upon the minutes.



######### 9208.  
The resolution of confirmation shall designate by reassessment number or other appropriate designation or description the parcels of land in the statement on file with the clerk upon which the reassessments are confirmed and levied.







##### CHAPTER 7. Recordation of Reassessment [9225 - 9231]

When the reassessment, as made or as reviewed and corrected, has been confirmed by the legislative body, it shall be recorded in the office of the superintendent of streets.



######### 9226.  
When recorded with the superintendent of streets the reassessment shall become a lien upon the various parcels of land assessed and shall be in lieu of the assessments orginally levied thereon.



######### 9227.  
Assessments originally levied, and all penalties and interest accrued thereon, shall be deemed superseded and supplanted by the reassessments.



######### 9228.  
The lien of the reassessment shall be given superiority and priority as of the date that the original assessment became a lien upon the property reassessed.



######### 9229.  
Reassessments and each installment thereof and the interest and penalties thereon shall be a lien against the parcels of land on which made, until the same are paid, but for a period not exceeding the time within which an action might be brought on the last series of refunding bonds issued upon the security of the unpaid reassessments.



######### 9230.  
Unmatured installments, interest, and penalties on unpaid reassessments shall not be deemed to be within the terms of any general warranty of title as to any parcel against which a reassessment is made.



######### 9231.  
When refunding bonds are issued, the reassessments and any reassessments which may be issued thereon or in lieu thereof, together with interest thereon, shall remain and constitute a trust fund for the redemption and payment of the refunding bonds and the interest thereon.






#### CHAPTER 8. Payment and Collection of Reassessments [9250 - 9291]  


##### ARTICLE 1. Reassessment Records [9250 - 9255]  

######### 9250.  
A copy of the resolution of the legislative body confirming the reassessments upon the security of which the refunding bonds are issued, shall be filed in the office of the auditor.



######### 9251.  
The auditor shall keep a record in his office showing the several installments of principal and interest on the reassessments which are to be collected in each year during the term of the bonds.



######### 9252.  
The auditor shall annually enter in his assessment roll on which taxes will next become due, opposite each parcel of land affected, in a space marked “public improvement assessment,” or by other suitable designation, the several installments of such reassessment coming due during the fiscal year covered by such assessment roll, including in each case the interest due on such total unpaid reassessments as herein provided, and also including a percentage of one-fourth of 1 percent of the amount of such installments and of such interest so entered.



######### 9253.  
The percentages when collected shall cover the expenses and compensation of the treasurer incurred in the collection of such reassessments, and of the interest and penalties thereon. No other percentage shall be claimed for any such collections.



######### 9254.  
In the event that reassessment collections are made by county officials for a city the county auditor shall at the close of the tax collecting season promptly render to the city auditor a detailed report showing the amounts of installments, interest, penalties, and percentages of reassessments so collected on each proceeding and from what property collected. The report shall also include a statement of the percentages retained for the expenses of making such collections.



######### 9255.  
If a parcel of land affected by any reassessment is not separately assessed on the roll so that the installment to be collected can be conveniently entered thereon, the auditor shall enter on the roll a description of the parcel affected, with the name of the owners if known, but otherwise described as “unknown owners,” and extend the proper installment opposite the entry.








##### ARTICLE 2. The Redemption Fund [9260 - 9263]  

######### 9260.  
The treasurer shall keep a redemption fund designated by the name of the bonds, into which he shall place all sums received by him from the collection of the reassessments made for such refunding and upon the security of which the refunding bonds are issued and all interest and penalties thereon.



######### 9261.  
A city proceeding under this division may at its discretion temporarily transfer money into the redemption fund from other funds in which such moneys are not immediately needed. The money so transferred shall be used to pay sums due from the redemption fund and shall be retransferred therefrom out of the first available receipts.



######### 9262.  
From the redemption fund the treasurer shall disburse and pay the refunding bonds and the interest due thereon upon presention of the proper bonds and coupons. Under no circumstances shall the bonds or the interest thereon be paid out of any other fund.



######### 9263.  
All money in the redemption fund upon the date the statement of the auditor is approved by the legislative body shall be paid to the holders of outstanding bonds and coupons entitled thereto at or prior to the delivery of the refunding bonds.








##### ARTICLE 3. Payment of Entire Assessment [9270 - 9271]  

######### 9270.  
Any interested owner may release and pay any unpaid reassessment by depositing with the treasurer of the city the total unpaid balance of such reassessment, together with the total interest which would become due on such reassessment were it paid in the regular way.



######### 9271.  
If an owner pays a reassessment in a lump sum and the proceeds of that payment are used for the purchase or call of a bond, the person paying the reassessment shall be entitled to credit and reimbursement of his proportion of the interest saved by such purchase or call, less his proportion of any costs incurred for publishing or serving any notice of purchase or call for redemption.








##### ARTICLE 4. Payment Under Protest [9280- 9280.]  

######### 9280.  
Taxpayers shall have the same right to pay such reassessment as so entered with interest, and any penalties thereon, under protest as they have to pay general taxes under protest; but in making payment under protest they must accompany the payment with their written protest.








##### ARTICLE 5. Payment in Installments [9285 - 9291]  

######### 9285.  
Reassessments shall bear interest from the date of recording of the reassessment at the rate or rates stated in the refunding bonds.



######### 9286.  
For each year the interest shall be computed and collected up to the next second day of July succeeding, no deduction being made by reason of any installment of such reassessment being due or paid prior thereto in such year.



######### 9287.  
Whenever it appears to the legislative body that according to the dates when taxes are collected in the city there will be an insufficient amount on hand to pay the interest then due, according to the method of collection provided in this division, then the legislative body may direct that such interest or some portion thereof be collected in the year preceding that in which it would otherwise be collected under this division. In that event the interest or portion thereof shall be extended on the rolls for the preceding year and be due and collected therein.



######### 9288.  
If the refunding bonds are payable in annual series, unpaid reassessments shall be payable in annual series corresponding in number to the number or series of bonds issued, and an even annual proportion of each reassessment shall be payable in each year preceding the date of maturity of each of the several series of bonds issued.



######### 9289.  
If the refunding bonds all mature in one year, the unpaid reassessments shall be payable annually and an even annual proportion of each reassessment shall be payable each year preceding the July interest payment.



######### 9290.  
The annual proportion of each reassessment coming due in any year, together with the annual interest on such reassessment, shall be payable in annual or semiannual installments, whichever is the method of collection of the general taxes of such city on real property.



######### 9291.  
Reassessment installments and the annual interest thereon shall be payable and become delinquent at the same times and in the same proportionate amounts and bear the same proportionate penalties and interest after delinquency as do the general taxes on real property of the city.






#### CHAPTER 9. Sale for Delinquency [9300 - 9318]  


##### ARTICLE 1. General Provisions [9300 - 9308]  

######### 9300.  
Upon default in payment of any installment of a reassessment, or interest or penalties thereon, the lands securing the reassessments shall be sold in the same manner in which real property in the city is sold for the nonpayment of general taxes, and shall be subject to redemption within one year from date of sale in the same manner as such real property is redeemed from such delinquent sale, and upon failure of such redemption shall in like manner pass to the purchaser.



######### 9301.  
In the event of default in the payment of any installment of any reassessment upon tax-deeded land or default in the payment of interest thereon, the land may be sold under this division as in the case of other lands.



######### 9302.  
The city shall be the purchaser at any delinquent sale in like manner in which it becomes or may become the purchaser of property sold for nonpayment of the general property tax, and shall pay and transfer into the redemption fund the amount of the delinquent reassessment and of the delinquent interest thereon.



######### 9303.  
If the municipal property tax is collected by county officials and sales for nonpayment of such taxes are made to the State, the State shall be the purchaser at any delinquency sale held pursuant to this division. However, the State shall hold the title acquired at such sale upon behalf of the city and shall account to the city for any money received upon redemption or from the sale of such property. The city, for the purposes of this division, shall be deemed the real purchaser.



######### 9304.  
As to all lands of which any city is deemed the real purchaser under the provisions of this article, such city and all of the officials thereof shall have all of the rights, powers, duties, and obligations granted, authorized, or imposed by this division.



######### 9305.  
If any succeeding installment of the reassessment on property purchased by a city at a delinquency sale or interest thereon is not paid in any future year, the property shall not be sold unless there has previously been a redemption from such sale or unless under the law it is then being sold for delinquent taxes.



######### 9306.  
The city shall, unless a resale has been made by it, from time to time, when due pay and transfer into the redemption fund the amount of any future delinquent reassessment and interest pending redemption. No redemption shall be made until any such subsequent payments, with interest and penalties, shall also be paid.



######### 9307.  
In the event of sale by the tax collector of any lot or parcel of land for nonpayment of taxes and of any installment of the reassessment thereon, or of the penalties, interest, or costs thereon, or for nonpayment of any installment, penalties, interest, or costs, then any certificate of sale or any deed issued is primary evidence of the regularity of all proceedings theretofore had, and shall be conclusive evidence of all things of which bonds issued upon the security thereof are conclusive evidence, and prima facie evidence of the regularity of all proceedings subsequent to the issuance of the bonds.



######### 9308.  
A deed issued under this chapter conveys to the grantee the absolute title to the lands described therein, free of all encumbrances, except unpaid installments, interest, and penalties under the same proceeding and except taxes and public improvement assessments which by law are equal or prior to the reassessment on which sale is made.








##### ARTICLE 2. Procedure When Funds Not Available for Payment [9315 - 9318]  

######### 9315.  
If there are no available funds in the treasury of the city or county with which to pay sums due on property bought at delinquency sales, the tax collector shall delay the entry of the certificate of sale until such funds are available, making demand in the meantime upon the legislative body that a suitable amount be included in the next tax levy for the purpose of providing funds with which to make such payment.



######### 9316.  
The delay in execution of a certificate of sale to a city or to the State referred to in the next preceding section shall not extend the period of redemption from the tax sale; nor shall the rights or privileges of the property owner be thereby affected.



######### 9317.  
The legislative body may, and in the event of demand by the tax collector therefor as provided in Section 9315 shall, at the time of fixing the annual tax rate and levying the taxes to be collected for general municipal purposes, levy a special tax upon the taxable property in the city for the purpose of paying for the lands purchased or to be purchased at delinquency sales held pursuant to this division, or for the purpose of paying installments of the reassessment or of interest which the city is required to pay, but not to exceed for each district, the bonds of which are refunded, ten cents ($0.10) on each one hundred dollars ($100) of assessable property.



######### 9318.  
The special tax provided for in this chapter shall be in addition to all other taxes and shall be computed, entered, and collected in the same manner and by the same persons and at the same time and with the same penalties and interest as are other taxes of the city.

Two or more issues of bonds issued under the act may be refunded in one proceeding under this division and only one issue of refunding bonds issued therefor, to be secured by all of the reassessments levied in lieu of the original assessments.



######### 9522.  
The proceedings for refunding two or more issues of bonds shall follow as nearly as may be the procedure for the refunding of one issue, with the modifications and changes in the resolutions, notices, reassessment list, bonds, auditor’s report, summons, complaints, and all other proceedings as may be necessary or convenient in carrying through the proceedings, and the legislative body conducting the proceedings is hereby granted full jurisdiction, power, and authority to refund two or more issues of bonds issued under the act in one proceeding under this division and with only one issue of refunding bonds secured by all of the reassessments and to perform all acts, take all steps and proceedings, provide all notices, and do all acts and things necessary or convenient for the refunding that are not prohibited by the United States Constitution or the California Constitution.



######### 9523.  
The resolution referred to in Section 9520 shall direct a qualified person retained or employed pursuant to Section 9506 to prepare and file with the city clerk a report containing the following:

(a) A schedule setting forth the unpaid principal and interest on the bonds to be refunded and the total amounts thereof.

(b) The total estimated principal amount of the reassessment and of the refunding bonds and the maximum interest rate thereon, together with an estimate of cost of the reassessment and of issuing the refunding bonds, including all costs of issuing the refunding bonds, as defined by subdivision (a) of Section 9600.

(c) The auditor’s record kept pursuant to Section 8682 showing the schedule of principal installments and interest on all unpaid original assessments and the total amounts thereof.

(d) The estimated amount of each reassessment, identified by reassessment number corresponding to the reassessment number on the reassessment diagram, together with a proposed auditor’s record for the reassessment prepared in the manner described in Section 8682.

(e) A reassessment diagram showing the assessment district and the boundaries  and dimensions of the subdivisions of land within the district. Each subdivision, including each separate condominium interest as defined in Section 783 of the Civil Code, shall be given a separate number upon the diagram.



######### 9524.  
When the report provided for in Section 9523 is filed with the clerk, the clerk shall present it to the legislative body for consideration. The legislative body may modify it in any respect. The report as modified shall stand as the report for the purpose of all subsequent proceedings, except that it may be confirmed, modified, or corrected as provided in this chapter.



######### 9525.  
(a) If the legislative body finds that all of the following conditions are satisfied, it may approve and confirm the report prepared pursuant to Section 9523 and proceed to authorize, issue, and sell refunding bonds pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 9600):

(1) That each estimated annual installment of principal and interest on the reassessment, as set forth pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 9523, is less than the corresponding annual installment of principal and interest on the portion of the original assessment being superseded and supplanted, as set forth in subdivision (c) of Section 9523, by the same percentage for all subdivisions of land within the district.  Any amount added to the annual installments on the reassessment due to a delinquency in payment on the original assessment need not be considered in this calculation.

(2) That the number of years to maturity of all refunding bonds is not more than the number of years to the last maturity of the bonds being refunded.

(3) That the principal amount of the reassessment on each subdivision of land within the district is less than the unpaid principal amount of the portion of the original assessment being superseded and supplanted by the same percentage for each subdivision of land within the district.  Any amount added to a reassessment because of a delinquency in payment on the original assessment need not be considered in this calculation.

(b) Any reassessment that is approved and confirmed pursuant to this section shall not be deemed to be an assessment within the meaning of, and may be ordered without compliance with the procedural requirements of, Article XIII D of the California Constitution.



######### 9526.  
If the legislative body is unable to make the findings required by Section 9525, it may proceed with refunding and reassessment by preliminarily approving the report and by fixing a time and place for hearing on the report and on the proposed refunding and reassessment.



######### 9527.  
Notice of the hearing shall be given by publication, pursuant to Section 6062a of the Government Code, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the city or, if there is no newspaper published in the city, then in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the city is located, and by mailing in the time and manner required by Section 10306; or, if the reassessment will not be in the same or lesser amount than the original assessments, in the manner set forth in Section 54954.6 of the Government Code.

######### 9528.  
Any person interested in any of the property to be reassessed may file a written protest against the proposed refunding or the amount reassessed against that person’s or any other property, as shown in the statement, at, or at any time prior to, the time fixed for the hearing on the refunding and assessment. The protest shall specifically set forth the nature thereof. Failure to file a written protest shall be a waiver of any right which the person may have or claim.



######### 9529.  
Any person who files a protest shall have full opportunity to be heard thereon.



######### 9530.  
At the time and place fixed for the hearing, the legislative body shall hear any complaints or objections that may be made concerning the proposed refunding, the amount of unpaid assessments, or the amounts of proposed reassessments as to any of the parcels of land to be reassessed.



######### 9531.  
At the hearing, no objections to the regularity of the proceedings with reference to the making of the improvements or the validity or the amount of any assessment levied in the original proceedings shall be considered. All other objections to any reassessment shall be deemed waived unless presented at the time and in the manner specified in this chapter.



######### 9532.  
The determination of the legislative body upon all objections or protests shall be final and conclusive.



######### 9533.  
The hearing may be continued from time to time by order entered in the minutes, but shall be concluded within 30 days from the date originally fixed.



######### 9534.  
At the hearing, the legislative body may review and correct the amount of any reassessments upon any parcel of land.



######### 9534.5.  
If the legislative body finds that protests against the proposed refunding or the proposed reassessments are signed by the owners of more than one-half of the area of the land proposed for reassessment, all further proceedings under the resolution of intention to refund are barred, and no new resolution of intention for the same refunding may be passed within six months after the decision of the legislative body on the hearing, unless the protests are overruled by an affirmative vote of four-fifths of the members of the legislative body. The legislative body may confirm, modify, or correct the proposed assessment.



######### 9535.  
At the conclusion of the hearing, in the absence of a majority protest pursuant to Section 9534.5, the report and the reassessment as originally made, or as reviewed and corrected, shall be approved and confirmed by resolution entered upon the minutes.



######### 9536.  
When the reassessment, as made or as reviewed and corrected, has been confirmed by the legislative body, it shall be recorded in the office of the superintendent of streets.



######### 9537.  
When recorded with the superintendent of streets and upon compliance with the provisions of Division 4.5 (commencing with Section 3100), the reassessment shall become a lien upon the various parcels of land assessed.



######### 9538.  
Except as otherwise provided in this section and in Sections 9546, 9547, and 9548, assessments originally levied, and all penalties and interest accrued thereon, which are included within the reassessments, shall be deemed superseded and supplanted by the reassessments. If, and to the extent that, the reassessments do not include unpaid installments of assessments originally levied and the penalties and interest thereon, the lien of the original assessments is not superseded and supplanted.

For purposes of this section and Section 9539, “unpaid installments” means those installments which are delinquent and those which are or may be posted to the tax roll for the fiscal year during which the reassessment is confirmed.



######### 9539.  
Except as provided in Section 9548, the lien of the reassessments shall be given superiority and priority as of the date that the original assessments became a lien upon the property reassessed. The lien of unpaid installments of the assessments originally levied and the penalties and interest thereon, and the lien of any remaining portion of the original assessments not securing refunded bonds, are equal in priority to the lien of the reassessments.



######### 9540.  
Reassessments and each installment thereof and the interest and penalties thereon shall be a lien against the parcels of land on which made until the same are paid, but for a period not exceeding the time within which an action might be brought on the last series of refunding bonds issued upon the security of the unpaid reassessments.



######### 9541.  
Unmatured installments, interest, and penalties on unpaid reassessments shall not be deemed to be within the terms of any general warranty of title as to any parcel against which a reassessment is made.



######### 9542.  
When refunding bonds are issued, the reassessments and any reassessments which may be issued thereon or in lieu thereof, together with interest thereon, shall remain and constitute a trust fund for the redemption and payment of the refunding bonds and the interest thereon.



######### 9543.  
A copy of the resolution of the legislative body confirming the reassessments upon the security of which the refunding bonds are issued shall be filed in the office of the auditor.



######### 9544.  
The auditor shall keep a record in his office showing the several installments of principal and interest on the reassessments which are to be collected in each year during the term of the bonds.



######### 9545.  
The reassessments and interest thereon shall be collected on the assessment roll and are subject to reassessment, amendment, and prepayment, and are otherwise subject to all of the provisions of the act in the same manner and subject to the same remedies on default and to the payment of interest and penalties on the enforcement thereof as were the original assessments which were superseded and replaced by the reassessments. For these purposes, the applicable provisions of Parts 8, 9, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.1, 13, 14, and 15 of Division 10 are hereby referred to and incorporated herein by reference.



######### 9546.  
The legislative body of any city which has issued bonds which are outstanding under this division, the original authorized aggregate principal amount of which was less than the aggregate principal amount of the original assessment which was levied as security therefor, and which intends to issue additional bonds to be secured by that original assessment to provide for and finance the construction and installation of further improvements, may, at any time, determine by resolution that the public interest or necessity requires the refunding of the bonds which are outstanding, the levy of a reassessment as security for the refunding bonds, and the continuation of the original assessment as to the unpaid principal amount thereof which shall be security for the additional bonds to be issued, and may declare its intention to so proceed by a resolution adopted pursuant to Section 9520.

The resolution shall, in addition to declaring the intention of the legislative body to refund the bonds which are outstanding and to levy reassessments as security for the refunding bonds, also declare the intention of the legislative body to issue additional bonds on the basis of the original assessment and to continue the original assessment in an amount sufficient to provide security for the additional bonds to be issued.  The resolution shall require that the report prepared pursuant to Section 9523 contain the unpaid principal amount of each original assessment in excess of the amount thereof which will be superseded and supplanted by the principal amount of the corresponding reassessment, which shall be security for the additional bonds to be issued.



######### 9547.  
If the legislative body elects to proceed pursuant to Section 9546, Sections 9523 to 9545, inclusive, shall apply to the reassessments to be levied. Upon confirming the reassessment, the legislative body shall, in the resolution adopted pursuant to Section 9535, order that the lien of the original assessment continue as to the portion of the unpaid principal amount thereof which will be security for the additional bonds which are to be issued on the basis thereof.



######### 9548.  
If the legislative body elects to proceed pursuant to Section 9546, upon confirmation of the reassessment as provided in Section 9535 and in compliance with Sections 9536 and 9537, the lien of the reassessment supersedes and supplants the lien of the original assessment as to the portion of the unpaid principal amount thereof which was security for the bonds which are to be refunded, but the lien of the original assessment continues as to the portion of the unpaid principal amount thereof which is security for the additional bonds which are to be issued on the basis thereof until the expiration of four years after the due date of the last installment on the reassessment.

The lien of the reassessment and the lien of the continued portion of the original assessment have equal priority as to the date the original assessment became a lien upon the property assessed.

The notice of reassessment filed pursuant to Section 3114 shall be entitled “Notice of Reassessment and Continuation of Assessment” and shall specify the relationship between the reassessment and the continuing amount of the original assessment.

The actual cost of such work may be added to the assessment of the lot on which the work is done. Nothing in this section limits or restricts the authority of the legislative body to make agreements authorized by Section 1263.610 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

For this purpose, an improvement shall be deemed to be in existence upon its authorization and an assessment upon its confirmation.

Upon obtaining the consent required in that chapter, a city may construct improvements and levy an assessment in a county or in another city, a county may construct improvements and levy an assessment within a city, and a public corporation may consruct improvements and levy an assessment outside of its boundaries either within a city or within a county. If no assessment is to be levied outside the boundaries of the city, county, or public corporation conducting the assessment proceedings, the proposed resolution of intention need not be submitted or approved and the consent required shall be obtained prior to the ordering of the improvement.



######### 10104.  
When any proceeding is initiated under this division by a legislative body other than that of a city or county, and before the resolution of intention is adopted, the proposed resolution, together with a plat or map which shall indicate by a boundary line the extent of territory included in the proposed district, shall be submitted for approval of the legislative body of the city, where the land to be assessed lies within the corporate limits of any city, or of the county, where the land to be assessed lies within an unincorporated territory. When such approval has been secured, the resolution of intention may be adopted and the legislative body initiating the proceeding may thereafter take each and every step required for or suitable for the consummation of the work and the levying, collecting and enforcement of the assessments to cover the expenses thereof and the issuance and enforcement of bonds to represent unpaid assessments.



######### 10105.  
As an alternative procedure for constructing any improvement authorized under the Improvement Act of 1911, the legislative body may pass a resolution of intention to do such work, which shall contain a provision that the work shall be instituted when any local, state, or national agency or authority accepts the proposed work as a project for which a contribution of labor, or labor and any portion of materials, supplies, or equipment, will be made by such agency or authority.



######### 10106.  
Under the alternative procedure the work to be done by the contractor shall consist of furnishing all or any part of the labor, materials, supplies, and equipment necessary for the construction of the improvements or the work may be performed or the labor, materials, supplies, and equipment furnished in the same manner as provided in Chapter 6 of this division.

For purposes of this section and Sections 10110 and 10111, “regulated public utility” includes a cable television company.



######### 10110.  
Before the ordering of the work, acquisitions, or improvements which are to be owned, managed, or controlled by any other public agency, regulated public utility, or mutual water company, the legislative body shall enter into an agreement with the public agency, public utility, or mutual water company which has, or may have, charge of the works, appliances, or improvements. The agreement may provide for the joint exercise of any power authorized by this division by two or more local agencies authorized to use this division if the legislative body of each participating agency adopts a resolution declaring that the joint agreement would be beneficial to the residents of the area of the agency. A local agency which is a party to the agreement may use the proceeds of any assessment or of any bonds or other indebtedness issued in conjunction with this division pursuant to the agreement to provide facilities which the local agency is otherwise authorized by law to provide, even though another agency which is a party to the agreement does not have the power to provide those facilities. Among other things, the agreement may provide for any of the following:

Whenever it is proposed to annex to the public agency the territory in which the installation or acquisition is contemplated, proceedings may be taken up to and including the confirmation of the assessment as provided for in Section 10312 prior to the commencement of the annexation proceedings.  If the annexation is successful, the assessment shall be recorded and other proceedings taken that may enable the parties to comply with the terms of the agreement.  If the annexation proceedings fail, further proceedings under the resolution of intention are barred.

Any agreement entered into pursuant to this section, to the extent that utilities have been financed by special assessments, shall provide that no main extension refund agreement shall be entered into with a developer.



######### 10110.1.  
If an agreement entered into pursuant to Sections 10109 and 10110 provides for the payment of refunds, and to the extent that the works, appliances, or improvements to which the refund payments are applicable are financed by special assessments, any amounts paid by the public agency, public utility, or mutual water company as a refund payment for the works, appliances, or improvements to be transferred to the public agency, public utility, or mutual water company under the agreement shall be deposited into a special fund to be established and administered by the city treasurer and applied as a credit upon the assessment and supplemental assessment, if any, in the same manner as provided in Section 10427.1, or shall be used to call bonds, or both. The credits shall be applied only to the assessments levied for the particular improvements for which the refund is made.

After the work, acquisitions or improvements have been completed and accepted, or conveyed to the public agency or utility, title to the works, appliances or improvements so installed, acquired or conveyed shall vest in the public agency or utility and constitute a part of its system, and shall at all times thereafter be used, operated, maintained, and managed by it as a part of such system.



######### 10112.  
In the case of a proposal for a water supply system or sanitary sewers and facilities, the preliminary steps, including, but not limited to, environmental impact reports, feasibility studies, engineering plans, cost estimates, legal expenses, and elections, may, at the legislative body’s discretion, be deemed to be improvements.

(c) An estimate of the cost of the improvement and of the cost of lands, rights-of-way, easements, and incidental expenses in connection with the improvement, including any cost of registering bonds.  If the legislative body, in the resolution of intention, ordered that private utility damages be included in the assessment, the report shall contain an estimate of the private utility damages. If the legislative body, in the resolution of intention, declared its intention to levy an assessment for the maintenance, repair, or improvement of the work, system, or facility, the report shall contain an estimate of the amount of this assessment for each of the first five years during which the assessment would be levied.

(d) A diagram showing, as they existed at the time of the passage of the resolution of intention, all of the following:

(1) The exterior boundaries of the assessment district.

(2) The boundaries of any zones within the district.

(3) The lines and dimensions of each parcel of land within the district.

Each subdivision, including each separate condominium interest, as defined in  Section 783 of the Civil Code, shall be given a separate number upon the diagram.  The diagram may refer to the county assessor’s maps for a detailed description of the lines and dimensions of any parcels, in which case those maps shall govern for all details concerning the lines and dimensions of the parcels.

(e) A proposed assessment of the total amount of the cost and expenses of the proposed improvement upon the several subdivisions of land in the district in proportion to the estimated benefits to be received by each subdivision, respectively, from the improvement.  In the case of an assessment for installation of planned local drainage facilities which are financed, in whole or in part, pursuant to Section 66483 of the Government Code, the assessment levied against each parcel of subdivided land may be levied on the basis of the proportionate storm water runoff from each parcel.  When any portion or percentage of the cost and expenses of the improvement is ordered to be paid out of the treasury of the municipality, pursuant to Section 10201, the amount of that portion or percentage shall first be deducted from the total estimated cost and expenses of the improvement, and the assessment upon property proposed in the report shall include only the remainder of the estimated cost and expenses.  The assessment shall refer to the subdivisions by their respective numbers as assigned pursuant to subdivision (d).

(f) A proposed maximum annual assessment upon each of the several subdivisions of land in the district to pay costs incurred by the city and not otherwise reimbursed which result from the administration and collection of assessments or from the administration or registration of any associated bonds and reserve or other related funds.



######### 10204.1.  
If the assessment district consists, in whole or in part, of lands subdivided or to be subdivided under the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act, Division 2 (commencing with Section 66410) of Title 7 of the Government Code, none of the costs and expenses required for compliance with the Subdivision Map Act, including but not limited to surveying and engineering costs incurred in the preparation of any map required by such act, shall be included in the incidental expenses of any improvement ordered to be made or acquired under this division. Incidental expenses under this division may include:

(1) The costs and expenses of modifying any tentative or final map prepared pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act for use as the map of the assessment district or diagram; and

(2) Any surveying or engineering expenses incurred for preparation of the plans and specifications of any improvement to be constructed under this division.   

(3) Any private utility damages.



######### 10204.2.  
If improvement bonds are to be issued pursuant to the Improvement Bond Act of 1915 (Division 10 (commencing with Section 8500)), the costs and expenses of the proposed improvement may include an allowance for interest not exceeding two years’ estimated interest on the bonds. The amount of the allowance for interest shall be paid into the redemption fund for the bonds upon sale and delivery of the bonds.



######### 10204.5.  
In preparing the report in which assessments are apportioned pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 10204, the person or board to whom the improvement is referred by the legislative body may presume that facilities which are required to meet the needs of future residents of an area, as indicated by a general or specific plan for the area, will benefit undeveloped and underdeveloped property within the area. If the legislative body adopts the report, that presumption shall be conclusive.



######### 10205.  
The provisions of the Improvement Act of 1911 relating to contributions are incorporated in this division as if fully set out herein.

At any time either before or after the formation of the district, the legislative body may provide by ordinance that for a period specified in the ordinance, but not exceeding the term of bonds issued or to be issued, the city may contribute, from any sources of revenue not otherwise prohibited by law, any specified amount, portion, or percentage of such revenues for the purposes set forth in such ordinance, limited to the following: the acquisition or construction of improvements, the acquisition of interests in real property and the payment of expenses incidental thereto for the use and benefit of the district.  In addition, the purposes specified in the ordinance may also include the application of such revenues as a credit upon the levied assessments in the same manner as is provided in Section 10427.1.  A brief statement of intention to provide such contribution of revenues shall be set forth in the resolution of intention.  Such contribution shall not constitute an indebtedness or liability of the municipality.  Contributions may be made from any sources of revenue not otherwise prohibited by law; provided, however, that any contributions authorized after the levy of assessment shall be from sources other than ad valorem taxes on real property.



######### 10206.  
The provisions of the Improvement Act of 1911 relating to assessments on publicly owned property and railroad property, and certificate or bond secured by unpaid assessments on publicly owned property, are incorporated in this division as if fully set out herein.



######### 10207.

######### 10209.  
In the assessment of land, credit may be given for dedications and for improvements constructed at private expense.



######### 10210.  
To expedite the conduct of proceedings and the making of any acquisition or improvement authorized by this division the legislative body may at any time transfer into a special fund designated by the name of the improvement proceeding, out of any available funds of the municipality, such sums as it deems necessary. The sums so transferred are a loan to the special fund, and shall be repaid out of the proceeds of the assessments provided for in this division.







##### CHAPTER 4. Notice, Protest, and Hearing [10300 - 10312]  

######### 10300.  
When the report provided for in Sections 10203 and 10204 is filed with the clerk, he shall present it to the legislative body for consideration. The legislative body may modify it in any respect. The report as modified shall stand as the report for the purpose of all subsequent proceedings except that it may be confirmed, modified, or corrected as provided in this chapter.



######### 10301.  
After passing on the report, the legislative body shall by resolution appoint the time and place for hearing protests to the proposed assessment and shall cause notice of that hearing and a public meeting required by Section 54954.6 of the Government Code to be mailed as provided in subdivision (c) of that section.  If new, increased, or extended assessments are proposed, the legislative body shall comply with the notice, protest, and hearing procedures in Section 53753 of the Government Code.



######### 10306.  
The failure of the clerk to mail the notice to any property owner or the failure of any property owner to receive the notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken under this division. If property assessed by the state under Section 14 of Article XIII of the Constitution is proposed to be assessed, the notice shall be mailed to every owner of the property at the address thereof shown on the last board roll transmitted to the county auditor.



######### 10310.4.  
The legislative body may remedy, revise, and correct any error or informality in any act, determination, or proceeding of the legislative body or any officer of the city. The legislative body may confirm, amend, alter, modify, or correct the assessment and diagram in such manner as to it shall be just and may instruct and direct the person or board making the same to correct them in any particular.



######### 10311.1.  
If it shall be necessary, in order to find whether a majority protest exists, to determine whether any or all of the signers of written protests are the “owners” of property to be assessed, the legislative body shall make such determination from the last equalized assessment roll.  The legislative body shall be under no duty to obtain or consider any other evidence as to ownership of property and its determination of ownership shall be final and conclusive.



######### 10311.5.  
If the proposed improvement includes the acquisition of any improvements constructed pursuant to the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act, Division 2 (commencing with Section 66410) of Title 7 of the Government Code, and such improvements were financed, in whole or in part, from the proceeds of any loan secured by a mortgage or deed of trust upon any lands within the proposed assessment district, upon submission of evidence, satisfactory to the legislative body, of the foregoing, the mortgagee or beneficiary under any such mortgage or deed of trust may protest in the same manner and to the same extent as the owner of such lands.

Any contract by a city for the acquisition of any such improvements shall provide that, in the absence of contrary written instructions by any such mortgagee or beneficiary, the purchase price for said improvements shall be paid to the owner and to the mortgagee or beneficiary, as their interests may appear.



######### 10312.  
(a) When, upon the hearing, the proposed assessment provided for in subdivisions (d) and (e) of Section 10204, and the maximum annual assessment provided for in subdivision (f) of that section, are confirmed as filed, as modified, or corrected, by resolution, the legislative body shall order the proposed improvement to be made or acquired, and declare its action upon the report and assessment.  The resolution shall be final as to all persons, and the assessment thereby levied upon the respective subdivisions of land in the assessment district.  

(b) If an annual assessment to pay for administrative cost is provided for pursuant to subdivision (a), the legislative body shall determine, by resolution, the amount of the annual assessment for this purpose, which shall not exceed the maximum assessment provided for in subdivision (a) and shall not exceed a reasonable estimate of costs actually incurred or likely to be incurred.  This determination may be included in the resolution adopted pursuant to subdivision (a).  The legislative body may subsequently determine by resolution that the annual assessment shall be a different amount, but in no event shall the annual assessment exceed the maximum annual assessment provided for in subdivision (a).  Resolutions adopted pursuant to this subdivision shall be final as to all persons, and the annual assessment in the amount determined shall thereby be levied annually until changed by resolution adopted pursuant to this section.  These assessments may be collected in the same manner and in the same installments as the assessments levied pursuant to subdivision (a), and may be combined with those assessments for collection in any manner which is convenient and economical.







##### CHAPTER 4.5. Change of Work, Boundaries of Assessment District, Amounts of Assessments or Proceedings [10350 - 10358]  

######### 10350.  
“Changes” as used in this chapter shall include corrections, alterations, modifications, additions, omissions, increases or decreases.



######### 10351.  
Unless the power to proceed shall have ceased at the conclusion of the hearing on the proposed improvement because of a majority protest, at any time before completion of the improvement proceedings, the legislative body may make changes in, to or from the boundaries of the proposed assessment district, the improvement ordered to be made or acquired, the assessment (including the amounts of any of the individual assessments therein), or in the proceedings, or any act, determination or provision made, or permitted to be made, by the legislative body under and pursuant to this division, which act, determination or provision does not affect the jurisdiction of the legislative body to order the improvement. The legislative body shall not change the boundaries to include any territory which will not, in its judgment, be benefited by the improvement.



######### 10352.  
All changes shall be made on notice and hearing as herein provided, except changes may be made:

(a) At the hearing on the report, which:

(1) Reduce the total amount of the assessment or make no change in the total amount of the assessment and no increase or decrease in the amount of money assessed on each parcel of property included in the assessment; or

(2) Eliminate a portion of the work or provide a substitution therein without increasing the cost of any assessment by reason thereof or substantially affecting the distribution of benefits from the work; or

(3) Eliminate a portion of the assessment district without increasing the amount of any assessment by reason thereof or substantially affecting the distribution of benefits from the work; or

(4) Exclude territory which will not be benefited by the improvement without increasing the amount of any assessment by reason thereof; and

(b) At any time after the improvements are ordered and during the pendency of the proceedings, which;

(1) Do not increase the total amount of the assessment; or

(2) Provide for the elimination or addition of work or substitutions therein, though they result in an increase in some assessments, provided that the owners of the property affected request in writing that the changes in the work and in the assessments be made; or

(3) Exclude territory which will not be benefited by the improvement without increasing the amount of any assessment by reason thereof.



######### 10353.  
Before ordering any changes made, other than as provided in Section 10352, the legislative body shall adopt a resolution briefly describing the changes proposed to be made, stating the amount of the estimated increase or decrease in the cost of the improvement by reason of the proposed changes and giving notice of a time and place when and where any interested person having any objection to the changes proposed to be made may appear before the legislative body and show cause why the changes should not be ordered.  The resolution shall also contain the name and telephone number of a local department or agency designated by the legislative body to answer inquiries regarding the hearing proceedings.  The resolution may describe the changes by referring to maps, plats, plans, profiles, detailed drawings, or specifications on file in the office of the clerk of the legislative body or engineer, which shall indicate the changes proposed to be made and which shall govern for all details thereof.  The resolution shall be published pursuant to Section 6061 of the Government Code, at least 10 days prior to the date of the hearing.  If new, increased, or extended assessments are proposed, the legislative body shall comply with the notice, protest, and hearing procedures in Section 53753 of the Government Code.



######### 10354.  
If said resolution proposes to include additional territory in the assessment district, or to increase any assessment, at least 20 days prior to the hearing fixed therein the clerk of the legislative body shall mail a copy of said resolution to all persons owning real property within said additional territory, or whose assessment is increased, whose names and addresses appear on the last equalized assessment roll or as known to said clerk.



######### 10355.  
Written objection to the proposed changes may be filed with the clerk of the legislative body by any interested person at any time not later than the time set for the hearing. The legislative body shall hear and pass upon such objections at the time appointed, or at any time to which the hearing thereof may be adjourned, and its decision thereon shall be final and conclusive. If no written objections to said changes have been delivered to the clerk up to the hour set for hearing thereon, or if said objections have been heard and found by the legislative body to be insufficient or have been overruled or denied, immediately thereupon the legislative body by an affirmative vote of four-fifths of its members shall acquire jurisdiction to order said changes made. The decisions and determinations of the legislative body ordering such changes after notice and hearing shall be final and conclusive upon all persons entitled to appeal thereupon to the legislative body.



######### 10356.  
If as a result of any proposed changes the legislative body shall determine that a supplemental assessment shall be necessary, the proceedings provided for by this chapter may either be combined with or conducted separately from the proceedings for such supplemental assessment. If said proposed changes shall eliminate or substantially reduce the estimated benefits to be received from the improvement by any subdivision of land within the assessment district, the legislative body shall not order any such changes without ordering a corresponding credit upon the individual assessment theretofore imposed upon such subdivision. Said credit shall be made in the manner provided in Section 10427.1.



######### 10357.  
Any changes made pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to the limitations, if any, contained in any law applicable to the proceedings, which law may impose limitations upon the amount by which the estimated cost of the improvement may be increased by reason of such changes.



######### 10358.  
Any changes made pursuant to this chapter shall not release or discharge the sureties upon any bond required under this division.







##### CHAPTER 4.7. Alternative Procedure for Authorizing Assessments [10360 - 10368]  

######### 10360.  
This chapter provides an alternative procedure for authorizing assessments pursuant to this division. It is not intended to alter or restrict authority to authorize assessments pursuant to other provisions of this division in any way. This chapter does not apply to proceedings to finance public facilities unless 80 percent or more of the district is developed for residential, commercial, or industrial use at the time that proceedings are commenced. This chapter shall not be used for the acquisition of existing works, appliances, or property except insofar as the acquisition is incidental to a proposed improvement not already installed.



######### 10362.  
All provisions of this division shall apply to proceedings pursuant to this chapter, except as expressly provided in this chapter.



######### 10364.  
For purposes of proceeding under this chapter, the report prepared pursuant to Section 10204 shall contain the following elements instead of those specified in Section 10204:

(a) A general description of the proposed project.  Detailed plans and specifications need not be included in the report.

(b) A general description of works or appliances already installed and any other property necessary or convenient for the operation of the improvement, if the work, appliance, or property is to be acquired as part of the improvement.  Acquisitions are subject to the limitation specified in Section 10360.

(c) An estimate of the costs of the improvement and of the cost of lands, rights-of-way, easements, and incidental expenses in connection with the improvement. If the legislative body, in the resolution of intention, ordered that private utility damages be included in the assessment, the report shall contain an estimate of private utility damages.  In addition to the estimate of the likely cost of the project, the report shall state a maximum cost of the project and any private utility damages.  If the legislative body, in the resolution of intention, declared its intention to levy an assessment for the maintenance, repair, or improvement of the work, system, or facility, the report shall contain an estimate of the amount of this assessment for each of the first five years during which the assessment would be levied.

(d) A diagram showing the assessment district and the boundaries and dimensions of the subdivisions of land within the district as they existed at the time of the passage of the resolution of intent.  Each subdivision, including each separate condominium interest as defined in Section 783 of the Civil Code, shall be given a separate number upon the diagram.

(e) A proposed assessment of a percentage share of the cost and expense of the proposed improvement upon each subdivision of real property in the district in proportion to the estimated benefits to be received by those subdivisions, respectively, from the improvement.  The amount of the proposed assessment against each subdivision of real property, assuming the improvement costs and expenses are the amount estimated in subdivision (c) and assuming the project costs and expenses are the maximum amount stated in subdivision (c). When any portion or percentage of the cost and expenses of the improvement is ordered to be paid out of the treasury of the municipality, pursuant to Section 10201, the amount of that portion or percentage shall first be deducted from the total estimated costs and expenses of the improvement and from the maximum costs and expenses of the project, and the assessment upon property proposed in the report shall include only the remainder of the estimated costs and expenses.  The assessment shall refer to the subdivisions by their respective numbers as assigned pursuant to subdivision (d).



######### 10366.  
(a) For purposes of proceeding under this chapter, the notice shall contain the following elements:

(1) A statement of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing on the resolution of intention and report.

(2) A statement of the total estimated cost of the proposed improvement and of the maximum cost of the improvement.

(3) The estimated and maximum amounts, as shown by the report, to be assessed against the particular parcel covered by the notice.

(4) A statement that any person interested may file a protest in writing as provided in this division.

(b) If new, increased, or extended assessments are proposed, the legislative body shall comply with the notice, protest, and hearing procedures in Section 53753 of the Government Code.



######### 10368.  
For purposes of proceeding under this chapter, the assessment shall be confirmed as follows instead of the procedure specified in Section 10312.

When upon the hearing the proposal to assess is confirmed as filed, modified, or corrected by resolution, the legislative body shall order the proposed improvement to be made and declare its action upon the report and assessment.  After design work and plans and specifications have been completed, and after contracts have been let pursuant to Section 10501, the legislative body shall, by resolution, fix the amount of the assessment, which shall be equal to or less than the maximum assessment stated in the report prepared pursuant to Section 10364, as filed, modified, or corrected.  If the amount of the assessment is more than the estimated cost of the project stated in the report prepared pursuant to Section 10364, as filed, modified, or corrected, the legislative body shall include, within the resolution fixing the amount of the assessment, an explanation for the increase over the estimated cost of the project.  In no case shall the amount of the assessment exceed the maximum assessment stated in the report, as filed, modified, or corrected. Resolutions adopted pursuant to this section shall be final as to all persons, and the assessment fixed shall be thereby levied upon the respective subdivisions of land in the assessment district.







##### CHAPTER 5. Levying and Collecting the Assessment [10400 - 10508]  

######### 10400.  
The validity of an assessment or supplementary assessment levied under this division shall not be contested in any action or proceeding unless the action or proceeding is commenced within 30 days after the assessment is levied. Any appeal from a final judgment in such an action or proceeding shall be perfected within 30 days after the entry of judgment.

If other than a municipal corporation is conducting the proceeding, the diagram and assessment shall be transmitted to and recorded by the corresponding officer of the entity conducting the proceeding, which officer shall be the county surveyor if a county is conducting the proceeding, and that officer shall perform the duties provided in this division for the tax collector. If neither a municipal corporation nor a county is conducting the proceeding, a certified copy of the diagram and assessment shall be recorded with the county surveyor if all or any part of the improvement district is in unincorporated territory, and with the superintendent of streets or tax collector of the city if all or any part of the improvement district is an incorporated territory.



######### 10402.  
The tax collector shall record the diagram and assessment received pursuant to Section 10401 in a substantial book to be kept for that purpose in his office. Upon the date of recordation with the tax collector or, if a certified copy is recorded with the county surveyor or the superintendent of streets of the city, or both, as provided in Section 10401, then upon the date of recordation, the assessment becomes due and payable, except that the legislative body may provide in the resolution adopted pursuant to Section 10312 that all or any portion of the assessment becomes due and payable on the date of the bonds which represent the assessments or portion thereof.



######### 10402.5.  
Upon the passage of the resolution provided for in subdivision (a) of Section 10312, the city clerk shall record a notice of assessment, as provided for in Section 3114, modified to reflect any annual assessment for administrative cost, whereupon the assessment shall attach as a lien upon the property assessed, as provided in Section 3115, except that the annual assessment for administrative cost shall become a lien at the same time as the property tax becomes a lien each year.



######### 10403.  
All assessments not paid within 30 days after they become due, except all unpaid assessments for which bonds are to be issued, shall become delinquent and the recording officer shall add to each delinquent assessment 5 percent of the amount thereof.

(2) The amount of the assessment.

(3) The date of the recordation of the assessment.

(4) The time and place of payment of the assessment and the effect of failure to pay within such time.

(4) If bonds are to be issued, the effect of the failure to pay the assessments within the 30-day period.



######### 10405.  
The tax collector shall fix a time and place for the sale of various parcels of land upon which the assessments are unpaid, which date shall be not less than 60 days nor more than six months after the date of the recordation of the diagram and assessment.



######### 10406.  
When the resolution of intention does not provide for the issuance of bonds, the tax collector of the entity conducting the proceedings shall give the notice of recording the assessment and collect and receive the assessments, and proceedings shall be had as provided in this chapter.



######### 10407.  
Within 30 days after the date of the delinquency, the tax collector shall begin the publication of a notice of sale of the property upon which the assessments have not been paid. The publication shall be made in the city pursuant to Section 6066 of the Government Code.



######### 10408.  
The notice of sale published pursuant to Section 10407 need not set out the description of the various parcels of land at length, but shall describe the parcels by their respective number as they appear upon the assessment and diagram. The notice shall refer to the assessment and diagram. Opposite the description or designation of each parcel of land shall be set out the name of the owner as it appears on the last equalized assessment roll for city taxes or as known to the tax collector, the amount assessed against the parcel, the penalty for delinquency, a fee which is required to reimburse the municipality for the estimated reasonable cost of providing notice pursuant to Section 10408.5, and the costs of sale chargeable to the parcel.

The content of the notice shall include the date, time, and place of the proposed sale, and the amount required to redeem prior to the time of the sale.

(b) The tax collector shall make a reasonable effort to obtain the name and last known mailing address of parties of interest.

######### 10409.  
At least 15 days prior to the date of the sale, the tax collector shall mail, postage prepaid, notices of sale to the owners of all property upon which the assessments have not been paid, as they appear on the last equalized assessment roll for city taxes or as known to the tax collector. The various parcels shall be designated by their legal description or by street number in addition to their respective numbers as they appear upon the assessment and diagram.

######### 10410.  
Upon the completion of the publishing and mailing of the notices of sale, the tax collector shall file with the legislative body an affidavit setting forth the time and manner of the compliance with the requirements for publishing and mailing the notices.



######### 10411.  
At any time after delinquency and prior to the sale of any parcels of land assessed and delinquent, any person may pay the assessment, and penalties and costs due on the property, including the cost of advertising if the payment is made after the first publication of the notice of sale.



######### 10412.  
At the time and place fixed in the notice, the tax collector shall proceed with the sale of the property advertised, commencing at the head of the list and continuing in numerical order of lots or parcels of land until all are sold. He may postpone or continue the sale from day to day until the sale is completed.

The tax collector shall sell separately each parcel of land in the published notice on which the assessment remains unpaid, or so much of it as is necessary to realize the amount assessed against the parcel and penalties and costs, and fifty cents ($0.50) for a certificate of sale. If there is no other purchaser for any lot or parcel of land so offered for sale, it shall be struck off to the city as purchaser.



######### 10414.  
For each sale the tax collector shall issue an original and duplicate certificate of sale, referring to the proceedings, describing the parcel sold, and giving the name of the purchaser and the amount for which the parcel was sold. He shall deliver the original certificate to the purchaser and keep the duplicate on file in his office, in the form of a stub, in the certificate book.



######### 10415.  
At any time before the expiration of one year from the date of the sale, any property sold pursuant to this chapter may be redeemed by payment to the tax collector of the amount for which it was sold and an additional penalty at the rate of 1 percent of the amount a month until paid.



######### 10416.  
The tax collector shall pay the redemption money to the person holding the original certificate of sale and shall require that the person to whom the redemption money is paid surrender the certificate and give a receipt for the money so paid. Upon redemption of any parcel of land the tax collector shall enter the fact and date of redemption upon the duplicate certificate of sale for that parcel of land.



######### 10417.  
If property sold pursuant to this chapter is not redeemed within one year, and if the purchaser or his assignee has complied with the provisions of this chapter, the tax collector shall execute to the person named in the original certificate, or to his assignee on his application, a deed of the property described in the certificate. The deed shall refer in general terms to the proceedings under which it is issued and contain a description of the property, any assignment thereof, and the fact that no person has redeemed the property. The tax collector shall receive from the applicant one dollar ($1) for making the deed, unless the city is the purchaser, in which case no charge shall be made.



######### 10418.

(e) The time when the purchaser or assignee will apply to the tax collector for a deed.

If the owner cannot be found, after due diligence, the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place upon the property, at least 30 days before the time stated therein as the time at which the application for a deed will be made.



######### 10419.  
The person applying for a deed shall file with the tax collector an affidavit or affidavits showing that notice of such application has been given as required in this chapter, and if the notice was not served on the owner of the property personally that due diligence was used to find the owner. The affidavit or affidavits shall be filed by the tax collector in his office.



######### 10420.  
If redemption of the property is made after such affidavits are filed, and more than 11 months from the date of sale, the person making the redemption shall pay, in addition to the other amounts required, three dollars ($3) for the service of notice and the making of the affidavits, which amount shall be paid over to the purchaser or his assignee in the same manner as other sums paid for redemption.



######### 10421.  
No deed for any property sold for delinquent assessment shall be made until the purchaser or his assignee has complied with all the provisions of Sections 10417 to 10420, inclusive, and has filed the proper affidavits with the tax collector.



######### 10422.  
The deed of the tax collector conveys the title in fee to the property and entitles the grantee, upon the receipt thereof, to immediate possession of the property described in the deed.



######### 10423.  
The deed of the tax collector is prima facie evidence of the truth of all the matters which it recites, and of the regularity of all proceedings prior to the execution of the deed.



######### 10424.  
As fast as collected the tax collector shall pay the funds collected by him pursuant to this division, either upon voluntary payment or as the result of sales, to the treasurer of the city. The city treasurer shall place the funds so received in a special fund designated by the name of the improvement proceeding. Payment shall be made out of the special fund so established only for the purposes provided for in this division.



######### 10424.2.  
(a) If the Orange County Board of Supervisors determines, subsequent to the issuance of bonds, that the acquisition or construction of all or any part of the proposed improvement will be delayed beyond the date upon which, at the time the bonds were issued, the acquisition or construction was expected to occur, the balance then on deposit in the improvement fund, or the portion specified by the  board, may, at the direction of the board, be applied to call outstanding bonds called for redemption.  The call and redemption of bonds pursuant to this section shall not cause the amount of any assessment to be reduced.  The board shall cause any annual assessment installments occurring after any redemption under this section to be reduced to the maximum extent permitted by law.

(b) The board may, from time to time, issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not in excess of the principal amount of bonds called for redemption pursuant to subdivision (a).  The net proceeds derived from the sale of the bonds shall be deposited in the improvement fund.



######### 10425.  
If the first assessment or the sale of bonds to represent assessments levied pursuant to this division fails to raise sufficient money to pay all costs, damages, and expenses of the improvement or acquisition, including any judgments rendered in the action and proceedings mentioned in this division and the costs and expenses thereof, the legislative body may pay the deficit out of the general fund, or may order a supplemental assessment to pay the deficit.



######### 10426.  
The supplemental assessment shall be made and collected in the same manner, as nearly as may be, as the first assessment. Subsequent supplemental assessments may be made, if necessary, to pay for the improvement. At the hearing the legislative body may confirm, modify, or correct the supplemental assessment. The decision of the legislative body thereon is final.



######### 10427.  
After completion of the improvement and the payment of all claims from the improvement fund, the legislative body shall determine the amount of the surplus, if any, remaining in the improvement fund by reason of the assessment and any supplemental assessment levied for the improvement. The surplus shall be used, in amounts determined by the legislative body, for one or more of the following purposes:

(a) For transfer to the general fund of the city, provided that the amount transferred shall not exceed the lesser of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or 5 percent of the total amount expended from the improvement fund.  

(b) As a credit upon the assessment and any supplemental assessment, in the manner provided in Section 10427.1.  

(c) For the maintenance of the improvement.  

(d) To call bonds, thereby reducing outstanding assessments and subsequent assessment installments.  In the event that the legislative body determines to use all or some portion of the surplus to call bonds prior to maturity, the treasurer shall do each of the following:

(1) Cause the special reserve fund, if any, to be reduced as necessary pursuant to Section 8887 to assure that the bonds will not become subject to federal income taxation.  

(2) Cause any assessment previously paid in cash to receive a credit in cash pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 10427.1 for the proportionate share of the surplus as determined pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 10427.1.  

(3) Cause the preparation of new auditor’s records to reflect the adjusted principal amount of the remaining assessment.  All subsequent assessment installments shall be based upon the adjusted principal amount of the assessment as reflected in the revised auditor’s record.



######### 10427.1.  
(a) If there is no supplemental assessment, the entire amount of the surplus shall be applied as a credit to the assessment or, as an alternative, any portion of the surplus may be used to call outstanding bonds.  If any supplemental assessment has been levied, any portion of the surplus shall be applied as a credit to the assessment or supplemental assessment, or both, or, as an alternative, may be used to call outstanding bonds, as the legislative body may determine.  Any credit upon the assessment or any supplemental assessment shall be made in the proportion which each individual assessment, or installment of principal thereof, bears to the total of all individual assessments in the assessment or supplemental assessments upon which the surplus is to be credited.  Any bonds called pursuant to this section shall be selected in accordance with Section 8768.

(b) Where an individual assessment, or any installment of the principal thereof, has been paid in cash after January 1, 1991, the credit shall be returned in cash to the person or persons owning the property for which the assessment or installment has been paid upon their furnishing satisfactory evidence of payment.  

(c) Where all or any part of an individual assessment remains unpaid, if the  individual assessment is not payable in installments, the credit shall be applied in its entirety upon the individual assessment.

(d) Where all or any part of an individual assessment remains unpaid and is payable in installments, the amount apportioned to each parcel shall be credited against the next installment or installments unpaid upon it after the two-year period specified in this subdivision.  When any of the surplus is to be applied as a credit upon the assessment, payable in installments, no credit may be paid or credited as provided in this section until after a period of two years from the date of receipt of proceeds of the sale of bonds by the legal entity conducting the proceedings.

(e) There shall be transferred to the general fund of the city (1) any portion of the surplus which has not been paid to or claimed by the persons entitled thereto within four years from the date of recordation of the assessment and any supplemental assessment or, if bonds have been issued, within four years after the due date of the last installment upon the bonds or of the last principal coupon attached thereto, and (2) any interest earned from the investment of any moneys constituting all or any part of the surplus when the surplus attributable to an individual remaining assessment is fifty dollars ($50) or less.  If the surplus attributable to an individual remaining assessment is greater than fifty dollars ($50), any interest earned thereon, less administrative cost of investing and crediting, shall be applied as a credit to the assessment.



######### 10427.2.  
If, pursuant to Section 10427, the legislative body determines that any surplus remaining in the improvement fund shall be used as a credit upon the assessment or any supplemental assessment, the legislative body may also determine that such surplus shall be applied as a credit to the city or any local, state or national agency or authority which shall have made a contribution towards the costs and expenses of the improvement. A credit on account of any contribution shall be made in the proportion which such contribution bears to the total amount of the assessment or supplemental assessment prior to the deduction of all such contributions. All such credits shall be returned in cash to the city, local, state or national agency or authority making such contribution. The surplus remaining in the improvement fund after making credits on account of contributions shall then be applied as a credit in the manner provided in Section 10427.1.



######### 10427.5.  
If any work to be performed under this division is deleted from a specific lot fronting on the improvement, the surplus in the improvement fund resulting from the deletion of such work may be returned to the owner of that lot, in the manner provided in Section 10427.1.



######### 10428.  
From the date of the recordation pursuant to Sections 3114 and 3115, each special assessment levied under this division is a lien upon the land upon which it is levied. This lien is paramount to all other liens, except prior assessments and taxation. Unless sooner discharged, the lien continues for a period of 10 years from the date of the recordation or, if bonds are issued to represent the assessment, until the expiration of four years after the due date of the last installment on the bonds or of the last principal coupon attached thereto. All persons have constructive notice of this lien from the date of the recordation.



######### 10429.  
The lien, whether bonds issued to represent the assessment or otherwise, shall be subordinate to all fixed special assessment liens previously imposed upon the same property, but it shall have priority over all fixed special assessment liens which may thereafter be created against the property.



######### 10430.  
The lien of a reassessment and a refunding assessment shall have the same priority as the original assessment to which it relates. A supplemental assessment is a new assessment.



######### 10506.  
At any time after the preliminary approval of the report provided for in Section 10300, by resolution adopted by a vote of two-thirds of all its members and without calling for bids, the legislative body may order that the municipality itself execute any or all of the improvement in accordance with the specifications and plans adopted for the work.



######### 10507.  
The legislative body, on ordering the municipality itself to execute the improvement, may authorize the municipality to employ the labor, and provide the material, appliances, supplies, and illuminating agent necessary to carry out the work.



######### 10508.  
The cost and expenses of work executed by the municipality itself shall be paid out of the improvement fund, but the amount appropriated and used from the fund for this purpose shall not exceed the amount of the bid upon which the award of the contract was made, or if no bids are received or the work is ordered without asking for bids, the cost and expenses shall not exceed the amount of the estimate provided for in subdivision (c) of Section 10204. If the cost and expenses do exceed the amount of the bid, or of the estimate in case no bids are received or the work is ordered without asking for bids, the excess shall be paid from the general fund in the treasury.







##### CHAPTER 6.1. Loan Repayment Assessment Districts [10550 - 10555]  

######### 10550.  
(a) If a municipality has entered into a contract with the state that includes a loan funded by the state for the purpose of financing the construction and installation of water or sewer system improvements in or along its streets that are of special benefit to land within the municipality, the municipality may conduct proceedings under this division for the formation of an assessment district for the purpose of levying an assessment to secure repayment of the loan.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the proceeding for the formation of the assessment district and the levy of the assessment shall be conducted in accordance with this division, with appropriate modifications to all resolutions and notices.



######### 10555.  
The legislative body shall provide in the resolutions required under Sections 10200 and 10312 that the assessment will be collected in annual installments.







##### CHAPTER 7. Improvement Bonds [10600 - 10610]  

######### 10600.  
The legislative body conducting the proceedings under the provisions of this division may, in its resolution of intention, determine and declare that bonds shall be issued under the provisions of either the Improvement Act of 1911 or the Improvement Bond Act of 1915. In any case, the assessment shall be recorded in the office of the superintendent of streets of the city, county surveyor of the county, or district engineer of the district or public corporation conducting the proceedings in the manner and with like force and effect as provided in the Improvement Act of 1911 and the Improvement Bond Act of 1915, and the assessment therefor shall have the priority, and the proceedings shall be subject to all of the curative clauses and powers of reassessment, provided in those acts. In any case, the official in whose office the original of the assessment is recorded shall give the notice to pay the assessments, as provided in this division.



######### 10600.1.  
If provision is made for the issuance of bonds under the Improvement Act of 1911 (Division 7 (commencing with Section 7000)), all assessments under one hundred fifty dollars ($150) which are not paid within 30 days after recordation of the assessment are delinquent and shall bear interest at the rate of 1 percent per month, the interest to be computed from the date of the bonds. The legislative body may order the collection of any such delinquent assessments pursuant to either Chapter 18 (commencing with Section 5410) or Chapter 18.1 (commencing with Section 5450) of Part 3 of Division 7. All references in those chapters to the contractor, his assignee, his assigns, or his agent shall be deemed to refer to the city. References in Section 5451 to interest from the “date of filing the original assessment” shall be deemed to refer to the “date of the bonds.”



######### 10600.2.  
The legislative body conducting the proceedings for the issuance of improvement bonds under this division may require that any bidder submitting a proposal for the purchase of such improvement bonds deposit contemporaneously therewith cash, a certified check, or a cashier’s check, in an amount to be determined by the legislative body, guaranteeing the purchase of such improvement bonds by such bidder in the event that he is awarded the purchase of such improvement bonds by the legislative body.



######### 10600.5.  
When the resolution of intention provides that bonds shall be issued under the Improvement Act of 1911 or the Improvement Bond Act of 1915, said bonds may be dated at any time after the expiration of the cash payment period.



######### 10601.  
An action to determine the validity of the assessment, bonds, contract, improvement or acquisition may be brought by the legislative body or by the contractor pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 860) of Title 10 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. For such purpose an improvement or acquisition shall be deemed to be in existence upon its authorization and an assessment upon its confirmation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the action authorized by this section shall not be brought by any person other than the legislative body or the contractor, nor except when permitted by Section 10400 shall the action be brought after the date fixed for the beginning of work.



######### 10602.  
The bonds may be issued and sold as the legislative body directs. The proceeds of the bonds shall be deposited in the fund specified in Section 10424. The notice in the resolution of intention shall recite a maximum rate of interest to be paid on the indebtedness, not to exceed 8 percent a year payable semiannually, which rate shall not be exceeded in the issuance of the bonds. All bonds shall be made payable to bearer.



######### 10602.5.  
When the resolution of intention provides that bonds shall be issued under the Improvement Act of 1911 or the Improvement Bond Act of 1915, and when the assessment has been duly confirmed pursuant to Section 10312, and when the assessment contains an assessment on public property which is subject to assessment pursuant to Section 10206 including, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, public property owned by the city, county or other entity conducting the proceeding, the legislative body may sell such assessment in the same manner and at the same time as provided in Section 10602. The proceeds of the sale shall be deposited in the fund specified in Section 10424.

The buyer of such an assessment shall, upon paying the purchase price, become the owner of the assessment and shall be entitled to exercise all the rights that an owner of an assessment has under Section 5302.5.

If bonds or certificates are to be issued to represent any assessment or assessments against public property, the legislative body of the entity conducting the proceedings may sell such bonds or certificates in the same manner and at the same time as provided in Section 10602.  The proceeds of the sale shall be deposited in the fund specified in Section 10424.

The buyer of such bonds and of each individual bond shall become an owner of the assessment and shall be entitled to exercise all of the rights of an owner of an assessment under Section 5302.5 and of a bondholder as provided in Section 5302.6 and Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 6468) of Part 5 of Division 7.

The buyer of each certificate shall become the owner of the assessment and shall be entitled to exercise all of the rights of an owner of an assessment under Section 5302.5 and of a certificate holder as provided in Section 6467.



######### 10603.  
When the resolution of intention provides for the issuance of bonds, the superintendent of streets of a city, surveyor of a county, or district engineer of a public corporation, conducting the proceedings shall give the notice of recording the assessment, and collect and receive the assessments. The legislative body of the public entity conducting the proceedings may, by resolution, designate the treasurer, tax collector, or other officer of the entity to collect and receive the money. If the entity is a public corporation it may designate the treasurer or tax collector of the county in which it is situated to collect and receive the money. The person so designated shall execute any certificates relating to the amount of assessments paid or remaining unpaid which are required to be executed by the superintendent of streets by the law pursuant to which bonds are to be issued, including, but not limited to, Sections 6420 and 8620.



######### 10603.1.  
In the event the city conducting the proceedings designates the county treasurer or tax collector to perform any service relating to collecting and receiving the money, including but not limited to, printing, servicing, or collecting any bonds, neither the treasurer nor the tax collector so designated shall perform any such service until there shall have been paid to him his estimate of the cost of the service or services, provided, however, the city conducting the proceedings, in lieu of the prior payment of the estimated cost, may enter into a written agreement with the county treasurer or tax collector. Such agreement shall provide for the payment of the cost or estimated cost of any service rendered by the designated county officer.

In the event such cost of estimated cost is not included in the assessment, the city conducting the proceedings shall be liable for payment thereof from the general fund.



######### 10604.  
The person who is to collect and receive the assessments before the issuance of bonds may be bonded in favor of the entity conducting the proceedings in an amount to be fixed and such bond approved by the legislative body of the entity. When he is a bonded official his services in receiving the money are a duty imposed upon him by law within the purview of his bond. In the case of a county official collecting for a public corporation, the county shall collect any money due on the bond as agent for the public corporation. If the legislative body designating the bonded person finds that his official bond is inadequate it may provide that he shall be separately bonded. The premium of such bond shall be an incidental expense of the proceeding.



######### 10605.  
The person collecting the assessments shall deposit the amounts received in the construction fund of the entity conducting the proceedings, not less than once each week, or at such other more frequent intervals as the legislative body of the entity determines.



######### 10606.  
The legislative body may, in its resolution of intention, determine and declare that bonds will be issued and paid, and the assessments therefor levied, collected, and augmented in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sections 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 of the Refunding Assessment Bond Act of 1935, in which case the applicable provisions of that act are incorporated in this division as if fully set out herein. If the bonds are issued pursuant to that act, appropriate changes shall be made in the form of the bonds to show that they are for a public improvement or acquisition under this division.



######### 10607.  
The list of unpaid assessments shall be filed, the bonds ordered issued, interest shall accrue from the date, and assessments thereafter paid before maturity, bonds called, premium paid, and illegal assessments and bonds reassessed, all as provided in the Improvement Bond Act of 1915.



######### 10608.  
The bond shall be entitled “Improvement Bond.” The provisions for payment of the bond before maturity, as contained in the bond form in the Improvement Bond Act of 1915, shall be inserted in the place of the similar provision in the bond form of the Refunding Assessment Bond Act of 1935. There shall also be inserted in the bond form after the title of the refunding act the words “as modified in the Municipal Improvement Act of 1913.”



######### 10609.  
In all cases where bonds are to be issued under any of the bond acts referred to in this chapter the proceedings shall be subject to all of the curative clauses, limitation of actions, and powers of reassessment provided in all of those acts, and the publication of the notice of improvement shall be deemed to be the publication of the resolution of intention.



######### 10610.  
Bonds issued pursuant to this chapter shall be conclusive evidence of the regularity of all proceedings under this division leading up to such issuance.







##### CHAPTER 8. Deferral of Assessments [10700 - 10706]  

######### 10700.  
Notwithstanding any other law, the legislative body may determine, by resolution, to allow landowners to defer payment of their assessments pursuant to this chapter. This chapter may be used only if 80 percent or more of the area of the assessment district is developed for residential, commercial, or industrial use.



######### 10701.  
The legislative body may determine criteria that property owners must meet to qualify for deferral, and may determine procedures to ensure that the criteria are satisfied.



######### 10702.  
No deferral arrangement may restrict, reduce, or eliminate any remedy of a bondholder provided by this division in the event of a default.



######### 10703.  
Deferral may be provided through a year-to-year agreement between the city and an eligible property owner, which provides that the city will make assessment payments on behalf of the property owner for that year. No agreement shall commit the city to make deferral payments beyond one year. No agreement of this type shall be construed as a debt of the city.



######### 10704.  
Alternatively, the city may create a deferral fund for the assessment district, and deposit into the deferral fund an amount sufficient to pay the asessments being deferred for a specified period of time. Funds in the deferral fund may be invested as other city funds are invested, or in more restricted ways as determined by the legislative body. Any investment of the funds in the deferral fund shall comply with federal arbitrage rules.



######### 10705.  
A city may increase the principal amount of bonds issued under this division by an amount sufficient to fund a program pursuant to this chapter. The proceeds of bonds issued for this purpose shall be placed in the deferral fund created pursuant to Section 10704, and may be used for no other purpose than financing deferrals. The proceeds may be invested in interest-bearing securities of the federal government with maturities occurring on or before the maturity of the bonds issued pursuant to this section. Any investment of those bond proceeds shall comply with federal arbitrage rules (26 U.S.C. Sec. 103 and the rules adopted pursuant thereto).



######### 10706.  
The amount of any deferred assessments, including interest at a rate determined by the legislative body, shall be due and payable whenever the parcel of property upon which the assessment was levied is transferred, or at the time of last maturity of the bonds issued for the improvement pursuant to this division, or at other times as determined by the legislative body.

##### CHAPTER 2. Purpose and Powers [11100 - 11103]  

######### 11100.  
The Legislature hereby finds and declares that in certain areas in cities and particularly in retail shopping areas thereof, there is need to separate pedestrian travel from vehicular travel and that such separation is necessary to protect the public safety or otherwise to serve the public interest and convenience. The Legislature further finds and declares that such objective can, in part, be accomplished by the establishment of pedestrian malls pursuant to this part.



######### 11101.  
The legislative body of a city shall have the power:

(a) To establish pedestrian malls.

(b) To prohibit, in whole or in part, vehicular traffic on a pedestrian mall.  

(c) To pay, from general funds of the city or other available moneys or from the proceeds of assessments levied on lands benefited by the establishment of a pedestrian mall, the damages, if any, allowed or awarded to any property owner by reason of the establishment of a pedestrian mall.  No money available for expenditure within the city from the proceeds of any tax, license or fee imposed by any public agency upon the ownership or operation of vehicles or the fuel used therein shall be used to pay such damages, except as may be permitted by Section 11005 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

(d) To construct on city streets which have been or will be established as a pedestrian mall improvements of any kind or nature necessary or convenient to the operation of such city streets as a pedestrian mall, including but not limited to, paving, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, sewers, drainage works, street lighting facilities, fire protection facilities, flood protection facilities, water distribution facilities, vehicular parking areas, retaining walls, landscaping, tree planting, statuary, fountains, decorative structures, benches, restrooms, child care facilities, display facilities, information booths, public assembly facilities, any improvements necessary or convenient for a covered air-conditioned mall, and other structures, works or improvements necessary or convenient to serve members of the public using such pedestrian mall, including the reconstruction or relocation of existing city-owned works, improvements or facilities on such city streets.

(f) To do any and all other acts or things necessary or convenient for the accomplishment of the purposes of this part.



######### 11101.5.  
The legislative body shall also have the power to acquire, by gift, purchase, eminent domain or otherwise, land, real property, or rights-of-way which will become part of a city street established as a pedestrian mall or which will otherwise be used by the city as part of, or for purposes connected with, a pedestrian mall, and such land, real property, or rights-of-way may be improved in the same manner as city streets may be improved under subdivision (d) of Section 11101. The legislative body shall also have the power to make such improvements on city streets adjacent to the pedestrian mall where such improvements are necessary or convenient to the operation of the mall. The acquisitions and improvements authorized by this section shall be deemed “improvements” as such term or a related term is used in this part and particularly in Sections 11101 and 11203 and in Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 11700) of this part.



######### 11102.

######### 11103.  
This part and all of its provisions shall be liberally construed to the end that its purpose may be effective. Any proceedings taken pursuant to this part shall not be held invalid for failure to comply with the provisions of this part, if the acts done and proceedings taken are not invalid under the State or Federal Constitutions.

This part does not affect any other law relating to the same or similar subject, but provides an alternative procedure for the subject to which it relates.  When proceedings are taken under this part, its provisions only shall apply.  The Special Assessment Investigation, Limitation and Majority Protest Act of 1931 shall not apply to any proceedings taken under this part nor to any proceedings taken under any other law for the improvement of a pedestrian mall.








##### CHAPTER 3. Resolution of Intention [11200 - 11204]  

######### 11200.  
When the legislative body shall determine that the public interest and convenience require the establishment of a pedestrian mall and that vehicular traffic will not be unduly inconvenienced thereby, it may adopt a resolution declaring its intention to establish such pedestrian mall. Such resolution shall contain:

(a) The determination and declaration referred to above.

(b) A general description of the city streets, or portions thereof, which are proposed to be established as a pedestrian mall.

######### 11201.  
In such resolution any street may be described by referring thereto by its lawful or official name, or the name by which it is commonly known, and the pedestrian mall, the mall intersections, and the intersecting streets may be described by reference to a map or plat thereof on file in the office of the clerk of the legislative body.

Those lands are as follows:

(a) All parcels of land abutting upon any portion of the pedestrian mall or any portion of any intersecting street.

(b) If assessments are to be levied as contemplated by Section 11202, then the notice procedures shall comply with Section 53753 of the Government Code.

######### 11303.  
Not later than the hour set for hearing any interested person may, severally or with others, file with the clerk of the legislative body written objection to the establishment of the proposed pedestrian mall.  Any protest or objection may be withdrawn at any time by written notice of the withdrawal filed with the clerk of the legislative body with the same effect as if it had never been made.  If assessments are to be levied as contemplated by Section 11202, the protest and hearing procedures shall comply with Section 53753 of the Government Code.



######### 11304.  
Not later than the hour set for hearing any person owning, or having any legal or equitable interest in, any real property which might suffer legal damage by reason of the establishment of the proposed pedestrian mall may file with the clerk of the legislative body a written claim of damages. Such written claim must describe the real property as to which the claim is made, must state the exact nature of the claimant’s interest therein, must state the nature of the claimed damage thereto, and must state the amount of damages claimed. The failure to file such written claim within the time provided shall be deemed a waiver of any claim for damages or compensation and shall operate as a bar to subsequent action seeking to prevent the establishment of said pedestrian mall or to recover damages on account of such establishment. The filing of such claim shall operate as a bar in any subsequent action to the recovery of any damages or compensation in excess of the amount stated in such claim. Any such claim may be withdrawn by the claimant at any time by written withdrawal with the same effect as if it had never been filed.



######### 11305.  
At the hearing held pursuant to Section 54954.6 of the Government Code to establish the proposed district all objections and protests shall be heard and considered, and all claims shall be heard and considered. The hearing may be continued from time to time by order entered on the minutes.



######### 11306.  
If the owners of lands abutting on the proposed pedestrian mall representing a majority of the frontage on the proposed pedestrian mall have made written objection to the establishment of the proposed pedestrian mall, the legislative body shall so find and shall terminate the proceedings for such establishment. In such event no proceeding hereunder for the establishment of the same or substantially the same pedestrian mall shall be commenced within one year after such termination.

If assessments are to be levied as contemplated by Section 11202, then the notice, protest, and hearing procedures shall comply with Section 53753 of the Government Code.



######### 11308.  
If assessments are to be levied as contemplated by Section 11202, then at the hearing the legislative body may change the boundaries of the proposed district by adding thereto land which in its opinion will be benefited by the establishment of the pedestrian mall or by excluding from the district lands which in its opinion will not be so benefited.  If the legislative body proposes any such change, the notice, protest, and hearing procedures shall comply with Section 53753 of the Government Code.



######### 11309.  
Any objections or protests, whether to the things proposed by the resolution of intention or to any changes proposed pursuant to Section 11308, not made at the time and in the manner provided by this part are deemed voluntarily waived, and the proceedings hereunder shall not be attacked on any ground not stated in a written objection filed as provided in this part. Except in the case of a majority protest, as provided in Section 11306, or Section 11307, the legislative body may sustain or deny any or all objections or protests and its determination is final.



######### 11310.  
At the hearing on the resolution of intention the legislative body may allow any claim for damages made pursuant to Section 11304. Any such allowance shall be for the full amount of damages claimed in the written claim except that the legislative body, with the written consent of the claimant, may allow a claim for a lesser amount. The right of any claimant to payment of the amount of any allowed claim shall be contingent upon the final establishment of the pedestrian mall; but all allowed claims must be paid by the city, from such source as the legislative body may determine, before vehicular traffic is prohibited, in whole or in part, on the pedestrian mall, pursuant to this part.



######### 11311.  
Following the conclusion of the hearing, the legislative body shall by resolution either abandon the proceeding taken pursuant to this part or determine that the pedestrian mall shall be established.








##### CHAPTER 5. Determination of Disputed Claims [11400 - 11402]  

######### 11400.  
If following the hearing the legislative body shall determine that the pedestrian mall shall be established, and if at that time there remain any written claims for damages which have not been allowed pursuant to Section 11310 or which have not been withdrawn, the legislative body shall direct that an action or actions be brought in the superior court in the name of the city by the county counsel, district attorney, or city attorney, as the case may be, or other attorney designated by the legislative body for a determination of the damages, if any, to which the claimant may legally be entitled because of the establishment of the pedestrian mall. Such action shall be in the nature of a proceeding in eminent domain for the condemnation of the right or rights in real property, the taking of which by the establishment of the pedestrian mall results in the damages claimed. Except as may otherwise be provided in this part, such action and proceeding shall be governed so far as the same may be made applicable by the provisions relating to proceedings in eminent domain. Except as provided in Article 2 (commencing with Section 1245.210) of Chapter 4 of Title 7 of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in any such action the resolution of intention adopted pursuant to this part and the resolution adopted under Section 11311 conclusively establish the matters referred to in Section 1240.030 of the Code of Civil Procedure.



######### 11401.  
The judgment in any such action shall be satisfied and a final order taken before vehicular traffic is prohibited, in whole or in part, on the pedestrian mall pursuant to this part.



######### 11402.  
Anything in this part to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this part shall be construed or interpreted as creating any right in any person to damages or compensation by reason of the establishment of a pedestrian mall, it being the intention of the Legislature in enacting this part to provide an orderly method for the determination and payment only of such damages and compensation as are required by the Constitutions of the State of California and the United States of America. In this connection the Legislature hereby expressly declares that it is its intention that to the extent to which the establishment of a pedestrian mall is justifiable as an exercise of the police power for which no compensation is constitutionally required, no damages or compensation shall be allowed in any action.








##### CHAPTER 6. Assessments and Bonds [11500 - 11505]  

######### 11500.  
If assessments are to be levied as contemplated by Section 11202, then in the resolution provided for in Section 11311, the legislative body shall fix and establish the boundaries of the district as finally determined.



######### 11501.  
After all claims for damages filed pursuant to this part have been finally determined, by allowance by the legislative body, by withdrawal, or by a judgment in an action or actions brought pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11400), and the full amount of damages to be paid has accordingly been finally determined, all or any part of the total amount of damages (but not exceeding that part thereof as may be specified in the resolution of intention), together with all costs and expenses incurred in connection with any proceedings or actions taken pursuant to this part, may be assessed against the lands within the district and subject to assessment, in proportion to the special benefits, in accordance with subdivision (a) of Section 2 of Article XIII D of the California Constitution, to be derived from the establishment of the pedestrian mall.



######### 11502.  
An assessment may be levied and bonds to represent unpaid assessments issued and sold substantially in the manner provided in the Vehicle Parking District Law of 1943, and to the extent applicable, that law shall govern as to the preparation of the diagram, the lien of the assessments, the notice of recordation, the collection of assessments, the issuance, sale and delivery of bonds upon unpaid assessments, the term of the bonds, the maximum interest rate thereon, the collection and enforcement of those bonds, and all other matters to the extent applicable and except as provided in this part.  The notice, protest, and hearing procedures regarding the levying of the assessment shall comply with Section 53753 of the Government Code.



######### 11503.  
In so applying the provisions of the Vehicle Parking District Law of 1943, the following provisions and exceptions shall apply:

(a) The limits provided by said law on the amount of the assessment shall not apply.

(b) The legislative body shall provide for the form of the bonds and of the principal and interest coupons to be attached thereto.

(c) The legislative body may provide that the redemption provisions of said bonds shall require the payment of such premium as the legislative body may specify.



######### 11504.  
All collections of assessments and all proceeds of the sale of bonds issued upon unpaid assessments shall be placed in a special fund and used exclusively for the payment of the damages, if any, and expenses for which the assessments were levied. If there is a surplus in such special fund, the legislative body may expend such surplus for the improvement or operation of the pedestrian mall.



######### 11505.  
Notwithstanding the fact that the proceedings under this part have provided that assessments are to be levied as contemplated by Section 11202, the legislative body, at any time and either before or after the adoption of the resolution provided for in Section 11311, may determine that such assessments shall not be levied. In lieu thereof the legislative body may provide for the payment of all or any part of the amounts referred to in Section 11501 out of general funds of the city or out of any other available funds. No money available for expenditure within the city from the proceeds of any tax, license or fee imposed by any public agency upon the ownership or operation of vehicles or the fuel used therein shall be used to pay such amounts, except as may be permitted by Section 11005 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. The legislative body may also provide at any time for the payment of all or any part of such amounts by including the same as part of the incidental expenses in any proceeding taken for the improvement of the pedestrian mall under the Improvement Act of 1911, the Municipal Improvement Act of 1913, or similar special assessment law for the improvement of the pedestrian mall.








##### CHAPTER 7. Establishment of the Mall [11600 - 11603]  

######### 11600.  
Following the adoption of the resolution provided for in Section 11311, and as soon as moneys have been fully provided for the payment of all claims, if any, allowed pursuant to Section 11310 and for the payment of all damages and compensation, if any, awarded in any action or actions brought pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing at Section 11400) hereof, the legislative body may adopt an ordinance establishing the pedestrian mall. Such ordinance shall contain:

(a) A general description of the pedestrian mall and a declaration and determination that the same is finally established.  The mall as finally established shall be substantially the same as that described in the resolution of intention.  

(b) Rules and regulations prohibiting vehicular traffic on such pedestrian mall subject to such exceptions as the ordinance may provide.  Such rules and regulations and such exceptions shall be substantially in accordance with the statements made in the resolution of intention.

(c) Such additional rules and regulations as the legislative body may determine pertaining to the interpretation, operation and enforcement of the rules and regulations referred to in subdivision (b) above, and otherwise pertaining to the use, operation, maintenance and control of the pedestrian mall.

(d) Such provisions as the legislative body may determine pertaining to the operative date or dates of any of such rules or regulations.



######### 11601.  
Such ordinance shall be adopted and published in the manner, and shall take effect, as provided by law or charter for other ordinances of the city.



######### 11602.  
Such ordinance shall be subject to referendum in the same manner as other ordinances of the city. No payment of allowed claims or damages or compensation awarded by any court shall be made until such ordinance is in effect but all such allowed claims, damages and compensation shall be paid before the rules and regulations provided in such ordinance become operative.



######### 11603.  
Proceedings under this part and the adoption of such ordinance notwithstanding, the city and its legislative body shall retain its police powers and other rights and powers relating to the city streets constituting a part of the pedestrian mall. No action taken pursuant to this part shall be interpreted or construed to be a vacation or abandonment, in whole or in part, of any city street or any right therein, it being intended that the establishment of a pedestrian mall pursuant to this part be a matter of regulation only. Nothing in this part shall be interpreted or construed to prevent the city and its legislative body at any time subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance provided for in this chapter, from abandoning the operation of the pedestrian mall, from changing the extent of the pedestrian mall, or from changing or repealing any of the rules and regulations pertaining to the pedestrian mall but Section 11304 shall not operate as a bar to any claim of damages resulting solely from changes made subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance provided for in this chapter.








##### CHAPTER 8. Improvement of the Pedestrian Mall [11700 - 11702]  

######### 11700.  
The city and its legislative body shall have the power to improve a pedestrian mall as provided in subdivision (d) of Section 11101, and for the accomplishment, in whole or in part, of that purpose may use the Improvement Act of 1911, the Municipal Improvement Act of 1913, or any similar special assessment law. Any work or improvement permitted by said subdivision (d) shall be deemed to be work or improvement permitted to be done under any such act or law. The city may also pay the whole or any part of the cost and expenses of improving a pedestrian mall from its general funds or from any other available money and may let contracts for the work in any manner permitted by law or charter. No money available for expenditure within the city from the proceeds of any tax, license, or fee imposed by any public agency upon the ownership or operation of vehicles or the fuel used therein shall be used to pay such cost or expense, except as may be permitted by Section 11005 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.



######### 11701.  
A pedestrian mall established or to be established pursuant to this part may be so improved either concurrently with the proceedings taken under this part for the establishment of the pedestrian mall or at any time subsequent to the establishment of the city mall, but no contract for the work or improvement shall be awarded until moneys have been fully provided for the payment of all claims allowed pursuant to Section 11310 and for the payment of all damages and compensation, if any, awarded in any action or actions brought pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing at Section 11400) hereof.



######### 11702.  
If in connection with the establishment of a pedestrian mall and concurrently with the proceedings taken pursuant to this part, the legislative body proposes to improve the proposed pedestrian mall and for that purpose uses the Improvement Act of 1911, the Municipal Improvement Act of 1913, or any similar special assessment law, the legislative body may combine any part of the proceedings taken pursuant to this part with any part of the proceedings taken under any such special assessment law, to the end that duplication of ordinances, resolutions, notices, hearings and other acts or proceedings may be avoided.

As used in this chapter, the term “district” means the district within which lie the lands deemed by the legislative body to be benefited by the establishment of the pedestrian mall, the boundaries of which have been finally fixed and established pursuant to Section 11500, and in this event such district so established shall be the “district” within the meaning of this chapter even though the legislative body may have determined pursuant to Section 11505 that assessments shall not be levied as contemplated by Section 11202.



######### 11801.  
If a district contemplated by Section 11800 has not been established pursuant to Section 11500, then the term “district” as used in this chapter means the district deemed by the legislative body to be benefited by the establishment of the pedestrian mall, the boundaries of which district have been finally fixed and established in the first proceeding taken for the improvement of the pedestrian mall pursuant to the Improvement Act of 1911, the Municipal Improvement Act of 1913 or any similar special assessment law.



######### 11802.  
If a district has not been established as contemplated by either Section 11800 or Section 11801, this chapter shall not be applicable.



######### 11803.  
Following the establishment of a pedestrian mall pursuant to this part and annually on or before June 30th, the legislative body may prepare and approve an estimate of the expenditures required during the ensuing fiscal year for the maintenance, operation, repair and improvement of the pedestrian mall and shall deduct from such estimate the amount of revenues, if any, which the legislative body estimates will accrue to the city during such year from the operation of the pedestrian mall.



######### 11804.  
The legislative body may levy and collect in any year upon and against all of the taxable land and improvements within the district a special ad valorem assessment sufficient to raise a sum of money not exceeding the net amount determined pursuant to Section 11803 but the rate of assessment in any one year shall not exceed fifty cents ($0.50) on each one hundred dollars ($100) assessed value as shown on the assessment roll used by the city for city taxation.



######### 11804.5.  
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11804, the maximum rate which may be assessed by the legislative body of the City of Redding for the Redding Midtown Project No. 1, R-120 only, is two dollars ($2) on each one hundred dollars ($100) of assessed value.

The special ad valorem assessment shall be levied, collected, and enforced at the same times, in the same manner, by the same officers, and with the same interest and penalties, as in the case of general taxes levied by the city.



######### 11806.  
The proceeds of the assessment shall be placed in a separate fund of the city and shall be expended only for the maintenance, operation, repair or improvement of the pedestrian mall.

(a) Plans and specifications which shall set out, among other things, the general type of street lighting system in each zone.  The lighting systems to be improved shall be divided into zones and in each zone shall be grouped those systems of approximately the same general type.  It shall be sufficient description of the location of the lights to be improved if such plans or specifications show or describe the approximate location of the lights.

(b) An estimate of the cost of the improvement, for the period of time during which it is proposed to be continued.

(c) A diagram showing the proposed assessment district and also the boundaries and dimensions of the respective lots or parcels of land within the district, each of which lots or parcels shall be given a separate number upon the diagram.  The diagram shall govern for all details as to the extent of the proposed assessment district.

(d) A proposed assessment of the total amount of the costs and expenses of the proposed improvement upon the several lots or parcels of land in the assessment district in proportion to the estimated benefits to be received by such lots or parcels, respectively, from said improvement.  If any portion or percentage of the costs and expenses of such proposed improvement is ordered to be paid out of the city treasury, the amount of such portion or percentage shall first be deducted from the total estimated cost and expense of such improvement, and the assessment proposed in the report shall include only the remainder of the estimated costs and expenses.  The proposed assessment shall refer to such lots or parcels upon the diagram by the respective numbers thereon.



######### 18042.  
When the report is filed with him the clerk shall present it to the city council for consideration, and that body may modify it in any respect, and in case of any such modification, the report as modified shall stand as the report for the purpose of all subsequent proceedings.








##### CHAPTER 4. The Resolution of Intention [18060 - 18062]  

######### 18060.  
After the report is considered by it, the city council may pass a resolution of intention to order the improvement.



######### 18061.  
The resolution of intention:

(a) Shall briefly describe the proposed improvement.

(b) Shall describe, in writing or by reference to the diagram referred to in Section 18041 with any modifications required by the city council, the boundaries of the assessment district.

(c) May order that a certain portion or percentage of the costs and expenses of the improvement, the amount of which portion or percentage shall be specified in the resolution, shall be paid out of the city treasury from any fund the city council may designate.



######### 18062.  
The city council shall, in the resolution of intention, provide that the improvement of the street lighting system shall be for a period of time stated in the resolution of intention. The dates of commencement and ending of that period shall be fixed by the city council on or before the date of execution of any contract as provided in this part, or, in the event that no contract is let and the maintenance or servicing is furnished by the city, those dates shall be fixed by the city council on or before the date of ordering the maintenance or servicing by the city. The city council may subsequently postpone the dates of commencement and ending of the period for a reasonable time upon good and sufficient reason appearing therefor and may, in any advertisement for bids and in any contract entered into, reserve the right to make such postponement for such reason.








##### CHAPTER 5. Protest and Hearing [18070 - 18077]  

######### 18070.  
(a) After the adoption of the resolution of intention, the city council shall direct the clerk to give notice and set the time and date for a public meeting and public hearing pursuant to Section 54954.6 of the Government Code.

(b) If assessments are to be levied as contemplated by Section 18041, then the notice procedures shall comply with Section 53753 of the Government Code.



######### 18074.  
(a) Any person interested who objects to the proposed improvement may file a written protest, stating his or her objections, with the clerk at or before the hour set for the hearing of protests.  The clerk shall indorse on every protest the date and time of its reception by him or her, and at the time appointed for the hearing shall present to the governing body all protests so filed.

(b) If assessments are to be levied, the protest procedures shall comply with Section 53753 of the Government Code.



######### 18075.  
The city council shall hear, consider, and pass upon the protests against the proposed improvement at the time appointed, or at any time to which the hearings may be adjourned, and its decision on all matters of protest shall be final and conclusive.  If those protests are sustained, the proceedings shall be abandoned but may be renewed at any time.  If those protests are denied or if no protests are filed the proposed assessment as the same shall have been modified or corrected shall be confirmed, and the city council shall thereupon acquire jurisdiction to proceed with the improvement and may by resolution order the proposed improvement to be made.



######### 18076.  
If there is a majority protest by the landowners in any zone to the improvement in that zone, or if the officer or person designated reports that it is practical to subdivide a zone and a majority of the landowners in that subdivided zone protest the improvement in that subdivided zone, the city council shall strike that zone or subdivided zone from the proceedings and correct the proposed assessment accordingly, unless that body, by a four-fifths affirmative vote of all its members finds that the public interest and convenience require that street lights in that zone or subdivided zone be improved.  The determination of the city council shall be final and conclusive.



######### 18077.  
If a zone or subdivided zone is struck from the proceedings, the city council may proceed the same as though that zone or subdivided zone was not a part of the original proceedings.








##### CHAPTER 5.5. Annexation of Additional Lands [18080 - 18084]  

######### 18080.  
Whenever in the opinion of the city council of any city the public interest or convenience may require that body to order the improvement of any street lighting system located on lands in the city outside the boundaries of a district established under the provisions of this part, whether or not such lands are contiguous to the boundaries of such established district, that body may, in lieu of establishing a new district under this part, order the annexation of such lands to an existing district established under this part and may assess, either partly or wholly, the costs and expenses, including all incidental expenses of such improvement, or of any one or more of the items thereof, upon the lands in the district, including the lands thus annexed.



######### 18081.  
The procedures applicable to such annexation and the lands so annexed shall, except as otherwise in this chapter expressly provided, be the same as those applicable to the establishment of the district and to the administration of such established district.



######### 18082.  
The improvement of the street lighting system within the lands so annexed shall be for a period of time not longer than that fixed for the improvement ordered to be made within the established district to which such lands are annexed.



######### 18083.  
The term of the contract to be let for making the improvement within the lands so annexed shall be for such period of time as will cause such contract to expire or terminate on the same date as the contract let for the improvement to be made in the district as originally established.



######### 18084.  
In the event that an ordinance requires the installation of a street lighting system by a subdivider, the resolution of intention may state that the territory owned by the subdivider comes under the terms of such ordinance and order that such territory, without notice and hearing, be formed into a district, or annexed to an existing district, established under the provisions of this part.








##### CHAPTER 6. Levying and Collecting the Assessment [18090 - 18099]  

######### 18090.  
After acquiring jurisdiction to proceed with the improvement, the city council shall levy the assessment for the portion or percentage required to pay for the improvement for the period of time beginning with the date of commencement of the improvement fixed by the city council and ending, as determined by and at the discretion of the city council either with the close of one 12-month period thereafter or with the close of the current or of the following fiscal year, upon all the respective lots or parcels of land in the assessment district. Thereafter during the period of time provided in the resolution of intention, the city council shall, on or before the beginning of the next succeeding 12-month period or the following fiscal year, levy in like manner and on the same lots or parcels of land the assessment for the portion or percentage required to pay for such improvement for such year, and said board, commission, or officer of the city authorized therefor shall, on or before 60 days prior to the commencement of each such period make and file with the city council a report in writing.



######### 18091.  
Such report shall contain:

(a) An estimate of the cost and expense of the improvement for the ensuing 12-month period or the ensuing fiscal year.

(b) A diagram showing the assessment district referred to in the resolution of intention, also the boundaries and dimensions of the respective lots or parcels of land within the district as it existed at the time of the making of the last mentioned diagram, each of which lots or parcels shall be given a separate number on the diagram.

(c) A schedule showing the proportionate amount of the assessment to be charged in proportion to the benefits to be received by each lot or parcel shown on the diagram required by subdivision (b) of this section.



######### 18092.  
Any surplus assessments collected shall be applied by the city council to reduce the assessment to be levied either for the next ensuing contract year or for the last contract year under the proceedings, and for the latter purpose such surplus may be permitted to accumulate in the assessment fund. Such reductions shall be made as nearly as possible to the zones or subdivided zones from which such surplus assessments were collected.



######### 18092.1.  
If there is any surplus remaining at the close of the last contract year under any proceedings, such surplus shall be used as follows:

(a) If new proceedings are started within one year after the close of the last contract year, such surplus shall be applied toward a reduction of the first installment of the new assessment.  Such part of the surplus as was collected from each zone or subdivided zone shall be applied to reduce the installment levied against that zone or subdivided zone.

(b) If new proceedings are not started within the one-year period or if one or more zones or subdivided zones are omitted for any reason from the new proceedings any such surplus or the surplus attributable to such omitted zones or subdivided zones shall become and remain a part of the general funds of the city.



######### 18093.  
If for any reason there is a deficiency in the funds derived from the assessment for any improvement, including all incidental expenses thereof, the city council may meet such deficiency by an appropriation out of the general fund of the city or by ordering a supplemental assessment in the same manner as nearly as may be as the first assessment, except that protests may only be made against such supplemental assessment.



######### 18094.  
Upon the levying of any assessment, the city clerk shall transmit the diagram and assessment upon which such levy is based, or a certified copy of said diagram and assessment to the city tax collector or to such other city officer or employee as the city council designates in the resolution levying the assessment or in case the city has adopted a method for collection of taxes by county officers then to the county tax collector, and such county tax collector shall have full power to perform the duties required in this part of the city tax collector.



######### 18095.  
The validity of any assessment levied under this part shall not be contested in any action or proceeding unless such action or proceeding is commenced within 30 days after the time the assessment is levied, and any appeal from a final judgment in such an action or proceeding shall be perfected within 30 days after the entry of such judgment.



######### 18096.  
Upon the receipt of the diagram and assessment or a certified copy thereof, the tax collector shall record them in a suitable book to be kept for that purpose, and append thereto his certificate of the date of such recording. Such record shall be the assessment roll. From the date of such recording all persons shall be deemed to have notice of the contents of such assessment roll. Immediately upon such recording, the several assessments contained in such assessment roll shall become due and payable, and each of such assessments shall be a lien upon the land against which it is made, and shall only be discharged by payment of the assessment or by redemption of the land after sale for delinquency.



######### 18097.  
The tax collector shall, upon the recording of such diagram and assessment, give notice by publication for five days in a daily newspaper, published and circulated in the city, or by two insertions in a weekly newspaper so published and circulated, that the diagram and assessment has been recorded in his office and that all sums assessed therein are due and payable immediately, and that payment of said sums shall be made to him within 30 days after the date of the first publication or posting, which date shall be stated in the notice. The notice shall also contain the statement that all assessments not paid before the expiration of the said 30 days shall be delinquent, and thereupon 5 per cent of the amount of each such assessment shall be added thereto.



######### 18098.  
When payment of any assessment is made, the tax collector shall mark opposite such assessment the word “paid,” with the date of the payment thereof, and shall give a receipt therefor. Upon the expiration of said period of 30 days, all assessments then unpaid shall become delinquent, and the tax collector shall mark each such assessment “delinquent,” and shall add 5 per cent to the amount thereof.



######### 18099.  
The lien shall be subordinate to all fixed special assessment liens previously imposed upon the same property, but it shall have priority over all fixed special assessment liens which may thereafter be created against the property. A supplemental assessment is a new assessment.








##### CHAPTER 7. Sale and Redemption of Delinquent Property [18120 - 18131]  

######### 18120.  
The tax collector shall, within 30 days after the date of delinquency, begin the publication of a notice of sale of the land upon which the assessments have not been paid, which publication shall be made by two insertions in a daily or weekly newspaper published and circulated in the city. The dates fixed for the sale of such land shall be not less than five days nor more than 10 days after the last publication of said notice of sale, or after the completion of posting, as the case may be.



######### 18121.  
The notice of sale so published shall contain a description sufficient to identify each lot or parcel of land delinquent, and opposite each description the name of its owner, if known, otherwise designating him as unknown, and the amount of the assessment and costs due, including the cost of advertisement, which cost of advertisement shall not exceed the sum of fifty cents ($0.50) for each lot or parcel of land separately assessed. The tax collector shall append to and publish with the notice of sale a notice that unless each delinquent assessment, together with the penalties and costs thereon, is paid, the land upon which the assessment is a lien will be sold at public auction, at a time and place to be specified in the notice.



######### 18122.  
At any time after such delinquency and prior to the sale of any lots or parcels of land assessed and delinquent, any person may pay the assessment thereon, together with the penalties and costs due thereon, including the cost of advertising, if such payment is made after the first publication of notice of sale.



######### 18123.  
At the time and place fixed in the notice of sale the tax collector shall proceed with such sale, commencing at the head of the list of lands contained in such notice and continuing in the numerical order thereof until all the land is sold, except that he may postpone or continue the sale from day to day until the sale is completed. The tax collector shall separately sell each lot or parcel of land described in such notice, or so much thereof as is necessary to realize the amount assessed against the lot or parcel together with the penalties and costs, and fifty cents ($0.50) for a certificate of sale. If there is no other purchaser the lot or parcel shall be struck off to the city as purchaser.



######### 18124.  
The tax collector shall issue for each sale an original and duplicate certificate of sale, referring to the proceedings, describing the lot or parcel of land sold, and giving the name of the purchaser and the amount for which the lot or parcel was sold. He shall deliver the original certificate to the purchaser, and he shall keep the duplicate on file in his office.



######### 18125.  
At any time after the date of sale and prior to the issuance and delivery of a deed to the land sold, any land sold under the provisions of this chapter may be redeemed by the payment to the tax collector of the amount for which the land was sold, with an additional penalty of 1 per cent per month of said amount together with such other penalties as may be payable as provided in this chapter. Said 1 per cent penalties shall be added on the first day of each month following the date of the sale of the land.



######### 18126.  
The redemption money shall be paid by the tax collector to the person holding the original certificate of sale upon his delivering up such certificate and receipting for the amount received from the tax collector therefor. Upon redemption of any lot or parcel of land the tax collector shall enter the fact and date of such redemption upon the duplicate certificate of sale thereof.



######### 18127.  
At any time after the expiration of 12 months from the date of sale, the tax collector shall execute to the purchaser, or his assignee, on his application, if such purchaser or assignee has complied with the provisions of this chapter a deed of the land sold, in which shall be recited substantially the matters contained in the certificate, also any assignment thereof and the fact that no person has redeemed the land. The tax collector shall receive from the applicant for a deed one dollar ($1) for making such deed, unless the city is the purchaser, in which case no charge shall be made therefor.



######### 18128.  
The purchaser or his assignee shall, at least 30 days before he applies for a deed, serve upon the owner of the land, and upon the occupant of the land if it is occupied, a written notice setting forth:

(a) A description of the land.

(b) That the land has been sold for a delinquent assessment (specifying the improvement for which the assessment was made).

(c) The amount for which the land was sold.

(d) The amount necessary to redeem at the time of giving notice.

(e) The date when such purchaser or assignee will apply to the tax collector for a deed.



######### 18129.  
If the owner can not be found, after due diligence, the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place upon the land at least 30 days before the date stated therein, at which the application for a deed will be made. The person applying for a deed shall file with the tax collector an affidavit showing that notice of such application has been given, as required, and if the notice was not served on the owner of the land personally, that due diligence was used to find the owner. The tax collector shall receive and file such affidavit in his office.



######### 18130.  
If redemption of the land is made after such affidavit is filed, and more than 11 months from the date of sale, the person making such redemption shall pay, in addition to the other amounts required, three dollars ($3) for the service of notice and the making of such affidavit, which amount shall be paid over to the purchaser or his assignee in the same manner as other sums paid for redemption. No deed for any land sold for delinquent assessments shall be delivered by the tax collector until the purchaser or his assignee has complied with all the provisions of this chapter and filed the proper affidavit with the tax collector.



######### 18131.  
The deed of the tax collector shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of all matters recited therein, and of the regularity of all proceedings prior to the execution thereof, and of title in the grantee.








##### CHAPTER 8. Alternative Procedure for Installment Assessments [18150 - 18155]  

######### 18150.  
The procedure in this chapter shall be an alternative procedure to that provided in other sections of this part, and the city council may use this procedure or not, in its discretion, and when used the period for which the work is to be done shall be upon a fiscal year basis.



######### 18151.  
When the assessment has been adopted and confirmed, as provided in Section 18075, the city clerk shall transmit the report, diagram and assessment, or a certified copy thereof, as finally adopted and confirmed to the city auditor, who shall record the same and thereafter enter on the assessment roll for general city taxes next coming due, opposite each lot or parcel of land affected, in a space marked “street lighting assessment” or other suitable designation, the assessment coming due thereon during the fiscal year covered by the assessment roll.



######### 18152.  
Assessments coming due under this procedure in any year during the period of time stated in the resolution of intention shall be payable in annual or semiannual installments, accordingly as the general city taxes are payable in annual or semiannual installments, and shall be payable and become delinquent at the same times and in the same proportionate amounts and bear the same proportionate penalties and interest after delinquency as general city taxes. Property securing such assessments shall be sold after delinquency in the same manner as property is sold for delinquent general city taxes, and shall be subject to redemption in the same manner as property is redeemable from sale for delinquent general city taxes.



######### 18153.  
The city may be the purchaser at any delinquent sale under this chapter in like manner as it may become the purchaser of property sold for delinquent general city taxes, and when the city becomes the purchaser it shall transfer into the special fund devoted to the improvement the amount of the delinquent assessment, penalties and interest then due thereon. In cases where under the law the city is not always the purchaser at sales for delinquent general city taxes, the city shall become the purchaser at any delinquent sale under this chapter if there is no other purchaser.



######### 18154.  
When the city becomes the purchaser the land shall not again be sold for any succeeding delinquent assessment, penalties and interest until it has been redeemed from the previous sale. The city shall, however, unless a resale has been made by it, from time to time when due transfer into said special fund, pending redemption, the amount of any succeeding delinquent assessment, penalties and interest. No redemption shall be made until all delinquent assessments, penalties and interest are paid. The purchaser at any delinquent sale, or at any resale by the city if the city was the purchaser, shall take the land subject to all unpaid assessments, penalties and interest due under this chapter.



######### 18155.  
If the procedure provided for in this chapter is adopted and the duties of assessing property and collecting city taxes are performed for the city by the county assessor and the county tax collector, in the manner provided by law, a certified copy of the diagram and assessment shall be filed with the county auditor on or before the tenth day of August. In each such diagram and assessment so filed with the county auditor, the descriptions of the properties reported shall be the descriptions used for the same properties on the map books of the county assessor for the then current year. The county auditor shall enter the amounts of the respective assessments on the county tax roll opposite the respective parcels of land and thereafter the said amounts shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as county taxes are collected and all laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of county taxes shall be and are hereby made applicable to such special assessment taxes.








##### CHAPTER 8.5. Alternative Procedure for Levying and Collecting Assessments on ad Valorem Basis [18160 - 18169]  

######### 18160.  
The procedure in this chapter shall be an alternative procedure for levying and collecting assessments, and the city council may by resolution determine, in its discretion, that this procedure shall be followed. Such determination may be made, with respect to the procedures governing the organization of the district, at the time when the city council shall order the making and filing of a report as provided in Section 18040. Such determination may be made in any succeeding year during the period of time for which the improvement is ordered to be continued, at least 60 days prior to the making of the general tax levy for city purposes.



######### 18161.  
In the event that the city council shall determine to follow the procedure provided in this chapter with respect to the organization of the district, the report shall omit the diagram and proposed assessment referred to in subdivisions (c) and (d) of Section 18041, but the plans and specifications referred to in subdivision (a) of Section 18041 shall include or be accompanied by a map or plat of the district, showing the lands, including all zones thereof, if any, to be benefited by the proposed improvement and to be assessed to pay the expenses thereof.



######### 18162.  
In the event that the city council shall determine to follow the procedure provided in this chapter with respect to the organization of the district, the resolution ordering the proposed improvement as contemplated by Section 18075 shall:

(a) Describe, in writing or by reference to the map or plat referred to in Section 18161 with any modifications required by the city council, the boundaries of the district, and of any zone included therein, as they may be finally established, and designate the district and each zone therein by name, number or other distinctive method;

(b) State the period of time for which the proposed improvement shall continue and, in the event the maintenance and servicing is to be furnished by the city, the dates of commencement and ending of such period;

(c) Describe briefly the proposed improvement, stating its estimated cost for the first year, and order the proposed improvement to be made;

(d) Specify what portions of the estimated cost for the first year shall be borne by the city and the district respectively, if less than the entire cost is to be borne by the district, and designate the fund to be charged with such cost; 

(e) Specify what proportion of the estimated cost for the first year to be borne by the district shall be borne by each zone therein;

(f) Order that portion of the estimated cost proposed to be borne by the district, and by each zone therein, to be paid by special assessment taxes levied upon all the lands, exclusive of improvements, within the district and any zone therein.



######### 18163.  
A certified copy of the resolution ordering the proposed improvement and the map or plat of the district referred to in Section 18161 shall be filed with each assessor whose roll is used for the levy, and with the State Board of Equalization. Compliance with this section shall be sufficient to meet the requirements of Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 54900), Part 1, Division 2, Title 5, of the Government Code. The map or plat shall show the precise location of the boundaries of the district and any zones thereof, and shall contain such information and data necessary to locate and retrace any and all such boundary lines, or shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth a legal description of such boundaries. Thereafter the assessor in making up the city assessment roll shall segregate the property included within the district on the assessment roll under the district designation contained in the resolution.



######### 18164.  
Each year during the period of time for which the improvement is to continue, and not less than 30 days prior to the making of the general tax levy for city purposes, the board, commission, officer or person designated pursuant to the provisions of Section 18040 shall furnish to the city council an estimate of the costs of the improvement for the next year. For the first year, the estimate of the cost of the improvement set forth in the resolution ordering the improvement shall be used.



######### 18165.  
The city council shall, at the time of making the next general tax levy and in the manner provided for the general tax levy, levy a special assessment tax upon all lands, and may at such time and in such manner levy a special assessment upon all improvements, within the district, and within any zone therein, which will be sufficient to raise that portion of the estimated cost of the improvement for the next year which is to be borne by the district.

The city council shall state in its levy whether the special assessment is upon all land within the district or upon all land and all improvements within the district.



######### 18166.  
Each year, at the time of making the special assessment tax levy, the city council shall appropriate from the fund designated in the resolution ordering the improvement or from any other available fund a sum sufficient to pay that portion of the total cost of the improvement which is to be paid by the city.



######### 18167.  
The city council may also transfer from the general fund of the city to the fund of the district sufficient money to pay all or any part of the percentage of the yearly cost of the improvement which is to be paid from funds raised from the district. The amount of money so transferred shall be deemed a loan to the district fund and shall be repaid to the general fund from the first money thereafter coming into the district fund from taxes levied upon lands within the district.



######### 18168.  
The special assessment tax shall be levied, computed, entered, collected and enforced at the same time, in the same manner, by the same persons and with the same penalties as other taxes for city purposes and when collected shall be paid into the city treasury to the credit of the fund of the district and shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 18092 and 18092.1, which shall be applicable to the procedure provided by this chapter, be used only for the payment of the expenses of the district.



######### 18169.  
If for any reason there is a deficiency in the funds derived from the assessment for any improvement, including all incidental expenses thereof, the city council may meet such deficiency by an appropriation out of the general fund of the city.








##### CHAPTER 9. Bids and Awards of Contract [18170- 18170.]  

######### 18170.  
At any time after the transmission of the diagram and assessment to the city tax collector or city auditor, the city council may let the contract for making such improvement. If the proceeding was commenced before the street lighting system referred to in the resolution of intention was installed or ordered installed, then such contract shall not be awarded until the street lighting system is installed or is duly ordered installed by the city council. If the installation of such proposed lighting system is abandoned, then the proceedings under this part shall be abandoned.

If there is more than one street lighting system in any city any or all of such systems may be consolidated and improved under one proceeding. In such case the consolidated system shall be zoned so that those systems of approximately the same general type are grouped together.



######### 18324.  
Whenever a street lighting system is installed along a boundary line or street of any city, the city council may, by resolution, assess the land abutting upon such boundary line or street for the estimated cost and expense of improving the system, even though the system is partially or entirely without the boundaries of the city.



######### 18325.  
If land has been assessed pursuant to Section 18324, the city council may proceed in all respects in connection therewith as though the street lighting system were entirely within the city limits; except that the city council may enter into a contract with the legislative body of the city or county having jurisdiction over the adjoining territory either to improve all or any portion of the street lighting system, or to have all or any portion of the system improved by the legislative body of the adjoining territory. The legislative body contracting to furnish such improvement may enter into any contract or issue any purchase order authorized in this part.








##### CHAPTER 3. Report and Resolution of Intention [18340 - 18343]  

######### 18340.  
The city council shall, prior to the adoption of the resolution of intention to order any improvement to be made, require the superintendent of streets to make and file with the clerk a written report containing the following:

(a) An estimate of the cost of such improvement and incidental expenses for the period of time recommended to be specified in the resolution of intention.

(b) A diagram or map showing the streets affected by the proceeding and in which street lighting systems have been installed and also each lot or parcel of land abutting such streets.  Each lot or parcel of land shall be given a separate number upon the diagram.  The diagram, as finally approved by the city council, shall govern for all details as to the lots or parcels of land benefited by the proceeding.

(c) A proposed assessment of the total amount of the probable or estimated costs and expenses of the proposed improvement upon the several lots or parcels of land shown on the diagram or map referred to in subdivision (b) above, in proportion to the estimated benefits to be received by each such lot or parcel of land, respectively, for the period of time recommended for the continuance of the improvement and which is to be set out in the resolution of intention.  The assessment shall refer to such lots or parcels of land upon the diagram or map by the respective numbers thereon.

(d) Plans and specifications which shall set out, among other things, the general type of street lighting system in each zone.  The lighting systems to be improved shall be divided into zones and in each zone shall be grouped those systems of approximately the same general type.  It shall be a sufficient description of the location of the lights to be improved if such plans or specifications show or describe the approximate location of the lights.



######### 18341.  
Upon the filing of the report, the clerk shall present it to the city council for consideration at its next regular meeting, and that body may correct or modify it in any respect. The report as approved or as corrected or modified by the city council shall stand as the report for the purpose of all subsequent proceedings.



######### 18342.  
When the report has been approved, the city council shall adopt a resolution of intention to order the improvement to be made. The resolution shall:

(a) Briefly describe the proposed improvement.

(b) Refer to the streets, by their lawful or official names or the names by which they are commonly known.

(c) If the improvement is not upon a street and there is no lawful or common name thereof, then briefly describe the land or right of way on which the improvement is to be made.

(d) Refer to the report of the superintendent of streets on file in the office of the city clerk.

(e) Fix the period of time for which the improvement is to be made.



######### 18343.  
(a) The city council shall cause notice to be mailed and set the time and date for a public meeting and public hearing pursuant to Section 54954.6 of the Government Code.

(b) If assessments are to be levied as contemplated by Section 18340, the notice procedures shall comply with Section 53753 of the Government Code.








##### CHAPTER 4. Protest and Hearing [18362 - 18366]  

######### 18362.  
(a) At any time not later than the hour set for hearing protests any owner of any lot or parcel of land liable to be assessed for the improvement may make written protest against the proposed improvement by filing his or her protest with the clerk.  No other protests shall be considered by the city council except as provided in this chapter.

(b) If assessments are to be levied, the protest and hearing procedures shall comply with Section 53753 of the Government Code.



######### 18364.  
If there is a majority protest by the landowners in any zone to the improvement in that zone, or if the street superintendent reports that it is practical to subdivide a zone and a majority of the landowners in that subdivided zone protest the improvement in that subdivided zone, the city council shall strike that zone or subdivided zone from the proceedings and correct the proposed assessment accordingly, unless that body, by a four-fifths affirmative vote of all its members finds that the public health and safety require that street lights in that zone or subdivided zone be improved. The determination of the city council shall be final and conclusive.



######### 18365.  
If a zone or subdivided zone is struck from the proceedings, the city council may proceed the same as though that zone or subdivided zone was not a part of the original proceedings.



######### 18366.  
Immediately upon the city council’s determination it shall have jurisdiction to confirm the report and assessment, and order the proposed improvement to be contracted for or supplied as provided in this part.








##### CHAPTER 5. Levying and Collecting the Assessment [18390 - 18405]  

######### 18390.  
The city council shall thereafter levy an assessment upon each lot and parcel of land for the first contract year for the amount estimated to be necessary to improve the street lighting system for the ensuing contract year. Prior to the expiration of each contract year the city council shall by resolution fix and levy the assessment for the amount estimated to be necessary to improve the system for such ensuing contract year.



######### 18391.  
The city council may order by resolution that any part or amount of the next installment of the estimated cost and expense of any improvement be paid out of the city treasury from such fund as the city council may designate, in wihich case the liability and obligation to pay any sum so provided for shall accrue and become fixed upon the date of the levy of the installment assessment next succeeding the adoption of the resolution.



######### 18392.  
Whenever a part of the next installment of the estimated cost and expense is to be paid by the city, the superintendent of streets, in making up the installment assessment for such cost and expense, shall first deduct from the whole estimated cost and expense that part or amount which is to be paid by the city, and shall assess the remainder of the cost and expense proportionately upon the lots or parcels of land liable to be assessed in the manner provided in this part.



######### 18393.  
Any surplus assessments collected shall be applied by the city council to reduce the assessment to be levied either for the next ensuing contract year or for the last contract year under the proceedings, and for the latter purpose such surplus may be permitted to accumulate in the assessment fund. Such reductions shall be made as nearly as possible to the zones or subdivided zones from which such surplus assessments were collected.



######### 18394.  
If there is any suplus remaining at the close of the last contract year under any proceedings, such surplus shall be used as follows:

(a) If new proceedings are started within one year after the close of the last contract year, such surplus shall be applied toward a reduction of the first installment of the new assessment.  Such part of the surplus as was collected from each zone or subdivided zone shall be applied to reduce the installment levied against that zone or subdivided zone.

(b) If new proceedings are not started within the one-year period or if one or more zones or subdivided zones are omitted for any reason from the new proceedings any such surplus shall become and remain a part of the general funds of the city.



######### 18395.  
Whenever a lot or parcel of land belonging to the United States or to the state, or to a county, city, public agent, mandatory of the government, school board, educational, penal or reform institution, or facility for the housing of persons with developmental or intellectual disabilities or mental health disorders and being in use in the performance of a public function abuts the public streets in which street lighting systems are located and are to be improved under the proceedings, the city council may, by resolution adopted prior to the levy of an installment assessment, declare that the lots or parcels of land or any of them shall be omitted from the installment assessments thereafter to be levied to cover the costs and expenses of the improvement.



######### 18396.  
If the lots or parcels of land, or any of them, are so omitted from any installment assessment then the total cost and expense of the improvement shall be assessed on the remaining lots or parcels of land lying within such zones or subdivisions of zones as the city shall direct in the resolution, without regard to such omitted lots or parcels of land.



######### 18397.  
If in such resolution the city council declares that the lots or parcels of land owned as provided in Section 18395 shall be included in an installment assessment or if no declaration is made respecting such lots or parcels of land, or any of them, the city shall be liable for such sums as may thereafter be assessed against such lots or parcels of land, which sums shall be payable by the city out of the general fund unless the city council shall in the resolution designate another fund.

Any such sums which may be assessed against any such lots or parcels of land shall not be payable by the city when such sums are paid by the owner of or the governing body controlling such lots or parcels of land.



######### 18398.  
The validity of any assessment levied under this part shall not be contested in any action or proceeding unless such action or proceeding is commenced within 30 days after the city council has acquired jurisdiction to confirm the report and assessment and any appeal from a final judgment in such an action or proceeding shall be perfected within 30 days after the entry of such judgment.



######### 18399.  
Upon the levying of an installment assessment the city clerk shall transmit the diagram and assessment and any modifications or corrections thereof made by the city council to the tax collector.



######### 18400.  
Upon the receipt of the diagram and installment assessment the tax collector shall record them in a suitable book to be kept for that purpose and append thereto his certificate of the date of such recording. Such record shall become a part of the assessment roll upon which other taxes of the city are entered and shall be collected at the same time, in the same manner and by the same officer as in the case of other city taxes.



######### 18401.  
Where the duties of assessing property and collecting city taxes are performed for the city by the county assessor and the county tax collector, in the manner provided by law, a certified copy of the diagram and assessment shall be filed with the county auditor on or before the tenth day of August. In each such diagram and assessment so filed with the county auditor, the descriptions of the properties reported shall be the descriptions used for the same properties on the map books of the county assessor for the then current year. The county auditor shall enter the amounts of the respective assessments on the county tax roll opposite the respective parcels of land and thereafter the amounts shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as county taxes are collected and all laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of county taxes shall be and are hereby made applicable to such special assessment taxes.



######### 18402.  
All sums collected on account of such assessment shall be placed in the city treasury to the credit of a special fund, which shall be designated by the name of the proceeding. The special fund shall be used only for paying the costs and expenses of the improvement described in the resolution ordering the work, including the cost of all posting and publication provided for in this part and any other incidental expenses connected with the proceeding. The city council may at any time advance to such special fund out of any available funds in the city treasury, sums in excess of the amount to be paid by the city toward the cost of such improvement and may reimburse the city for such advances by repaying the amount thereof out of any money that thereafter comes into such special fund.



######### 18403.  
When the diagram and installment assessment are recorded, the several amounts assessed shall be a lien upon the lots or parcels of land assessed, respectively. Such lien shall continue and be enforced in the same manner and with the same penalties as other taxes of the city are continued and enforced.



######### 18404.  
Where the duties of assessing property and collecting city taxes are performed for a city by the county assessor and the county tax collector in a manner provided by law, cities and counties may enter into an agreement whereby special assessments may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as county taxes are collected and all laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of county taxes shall be and are hereby made applicable to such special assessments. The amount of the compensation to be paid a county for the collection of such assessments shall be provided for in the agreement.



######### 18405.  
The lien shall be subordinate to all fixed special assessment liens previously imposed upon the same property, but it shall have priority over all fixed special assessment liens which may thereafter be created against the property. A supplemental assessment is a new assessment.








##### CHAPTER 7. City Furnishing Maintenance and Service [18440- 18440.]  

######### 18440.  
If the city owns or operates or owns and operates a public utility capable of furnishing the improvement provided for in this part, this section may be used as an alternative procedure to that provided in Chapter 6 of this part. The city council by resolution may direct the superintendent of streets, instead of calling for bids and entering into a contract, to issue an interdepartmental purchase order for the improvement of the street lighting system upon such terms as may be agreed upon between the street superintendent and the public utility board or commission. Such purchase order shall not be effective until it is approved by the city council. The interdepartmental purchase order shall state the date on which the improvement shall be started and that it shall continue in force for a period of one year from the effective date thereof.

The city council shall at the time of making the next general tax levy in the city and in the manner provided for the general tax levy, levy a special assessment tax upon all the lands, exclusive of improvements, within the district which will be sufficient to raise that percentage of the total sum required in the estimate which is to be raised from the district.



######### 18731.  
The special assessment tax shall be levied, computed, entered, collected and enforced at the same time, in the same manner, by the same persons and with the same penalties and priority of lien as other taxes for city purposes and when collected shall be paid into the city treasury to the credit of the fund of the district and shall be used only for the payment of the expenses of the district.



######### 18732.  
The city council shall control and order the expenditure of the funds of the district for the purposes of maintenance and operation as provided in the final resolution.

Any balance remaining in the fund at the end of the term for which the district is formed shall be used to help furnish electric current for the systems maintained and operated from the funds raised in whole or in part from the district.



######### 18733.  
Each year at the time of making the special assessment tax levy the city council shall appropriate from the fund designated in the resolution of intention or from any other available fund a sum sufficient to pay that percentage of the total expenses of the maintenance and operation which is to be paid by the city.



######### 18734.  
The city council may also transfer from the general fund of the city to the fund of the district sufficient money to pay all or any part of the percentage of the yearly expenses of the maintenance and operation which is to be paid from funds raised from the district.

The sole acts necessary to confer jurisdiction upon the city council to order the formation of a district under the provisions of this part and the furnishing of maintenance and operation for street lighting systems therein shall consist of the adoption of a resolution of intention and the publication of the same in accordance with the provisions of this part.



######### 18781.  
No error, defect, irregularity, informality, neglect or omission of any officer of any city in any proceeding taken under the provisions of this part, which does not affect the jurisdiction of the governing body to order the formation of a district shall avoid or invalidate the proceedings.

The clerk shall also cause a notice, similar in content to the posted notice, to be published at least once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper selected by the board of supervisors which is of general circulation and is printed and published in the county in which the proposed district is located. The last publication shall be made at least seven days before the date set for the hearing of the petition.



######### 19053.  
Any person interested, who objects either to the formation of the district, or to the extent of the district, or to the proposed improvement, or to the inclusion of his property in the district, may file a written protest, setting forth his objections, with the clerk at or before the time set for the hearing of the petition. The clerk shall indorse on each protest the date of its filing with him, and at the time appointed for the hearing he shall present all protests so filed with him to the board of supervisors.



######### 19054.  
The board of supervisors shall hear and pass upon the petition and protests at the time appointed or at any time to which the hearing thereof is adjourned. Its decision thereon shall be final and conclusive.



######### 19055.  
If any person protests against the extent of the district, or against the inclusion of property in the district, the board of supervisors shall have power to make such changes in the boundaries of the proposed district as it finds to be proper and advisable. The board of supervisors shall establish the boundaries of the district in accordance with its findings, but it shall not extend the boundaries of the district, nor shall it modify the boundaries so as to exclude from the proposed district any territory which will be benefited by the improvement. Any territory which in the judgment of the board will not be benefited by the improvement shall not be included within the proposed district.



######### 19056.  
In the event that an ordinance requires the installation of a street lighting system by a subdivider, the board of supervisors may, as an alternative procedure, adopt a resolution stating that the territory described in the resolution is owned by the subdivider and comes under the terms of such ordinance, and order that such territory be formed into a district or annexed to a district. If this procedure is used, the provisions of this part relating to petition, notice, hearing, election, and the District Investigation Law of 1933 shall not be applicable.








##### CHAPTER 4. Authority to Proceed [19070 - 19071]  

######### 19070.  
If no protests are filed, or if all protests filed are heard and denied or if authorized modifications are made in the boundaries of the proposed district and the boundaries finally established, the board of supervisors shall have jurisdiction to proceed.



######### 19071.  
If the board finds that the petition was signed by taxpayers representing 60 percent or more of the total assessed valuation of all taxable property within the territory therein proposed to be formed into a district, and within the boundaries thereof as finally established by the board, and that public interest and convenience do not require that an election be held upon the proposed formation of said district, it may proceed to establish the district by resolution. The provisions of Section 19112 shall apply to a district formed pursuant to this section.








##### CHAPTER 5. Calling and Conducting the Election [19090 - 19094]  

######### 19090.  
Within 30 days after acquiring jurisdiction to proceed, the board of supervisors shall by resolution order that an election be held in the proposed district to determine whether or not the district shall be formed. The board may establish one or more voting precincts within the district and appoint one inspector, one judge, and two clerks residing in the district for each voting precinct to conduct the election, which shall be held on the next established election date not less than 130 days after the date of the resolution ordering it to be held.



######### 19091.  
The election shall be called by posting notice thereof in three public places in the proposed lighting district, and by publishing the notice in a daily or weekly newspaper, published and circulated in the district, if there is one, at least once a week for not less than 15 days. The notices shall specify the time, place and purposes of the election, give the boundaries of the proposed lighting district, and the hours during which the polls will be kept open. The polls shall be open the same hours as provided at general elections.



######### 19092.  
The election shall be conducted in accordance with the general election laws of this state, where applicable.  The ballots shall contain the words, “For lighting district,” and “Against lighting district,” and the voter shall mark his or her ballot in the space provided for that purpose, in accordance with the general election laws of this state.



######### 19093.  
Every registered voter in the jurisdiction shall be entitled to vote at this election.



######### 19094.  
The precinct boards shall canvass the votes in accordance with the general laws of this state.  The board of supervisors may order the county elections official to conduct the official canvass within seven days subsequent to the holding of the election.








##### CHAPTER 6. Establishing the District [19110 - 19112]  

######### 19110.  
If a majority of the votes cast at the election is in favor of a lighting district, the board of supervisors shall by resolution establish the district.



######### 19111.  
If a majority of the votes cast are against the lighting district, the board of supervisors shall by order so declare. No other proceedings shall be taken for the formation of another lighting district until the expiration of one year from the date of filing of the defeated petition.



######### 19112.  
The fact of the filing of the petition, and the resolution establishing the lighting district, shall be entered in the minutes of the board of supervisors and that entry shall be conclusive evidence of the existence and validity of the district and of the fact that all steps prerequisite to its existence were duly and regularly taken.








##### CHAPTER 7. Authority of the Governing Body [19130 - 19132]  

######### 19130.  
The board of supervisors of the county in which the lighting district has been established shall be ex officio the governing body of the lighting district and shall serve without compensation.



######### 19131.  
The district may sue and be sued.



######### 19132.  
The governing body shall:

(a) Make all rules, regulations and laws necessary for the administration, operation and maintenance of the highway lighting district.

(b) Supervise and plan a system of highway illumination for the district and decide upon the kind of service most feasible for the district.  Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the board of supervisors from installing and maintaining electric lights on highways in the district for the safety of persons using the roads and bridges and from paying for the same out of the road fund of the county or district road fund.

(c) Indicate the placing and installation of all lights and any and all subsequent additional lights, except that the governing body may authorize a designated officer to indicate the placing and installation of lights in accordance with standards adopted by the governing body.

(d) Receive bids, award and make contracts with lighting companies in the name of the district to its very best advantage for the installation and maintenance of the street lighting system or any portion thereof and for servicing the same, except the governing body may authorize a designated officer to make, execute, and administer such contracts in the name of the district in accordance with this chapter.

(e) Determine the number of employees necessary to properly care for and maintain the system.  The governing body shall prescribe their duties and fix their compensation.  All district employees shall hold their positions at the pleasure of the governing body.

(f) Designate the hours for lighting the district.

(g) Perform all other acts necessary or proper to carry out the provisions of this part.








##### CHAPTER 8. Bids and Award of Contracts [19151- 19151.]  

######### 19151.  
In granting authority to install the system and in contractng for service the governing body shall impose such restrictions and conditions, and provide for such locations of the various wires and lights, as will work the least possible public or private inconvenience.








##### CHAPTER 9. Installation of Additional Lights [19160 - 19162]  

######### 19160.  
Proceedings for the installation and maintenance of additional lights may be instituted by the governing body on its own initiative and shall be instituted by the governing body when:

(a) A written request therefor, signed by two members of the governing body, is filed with the governing body; or

(b) A petition therefor, signed by 20 or more taxpayers of the district, is filed with the governing body.  The petition may consist of any number of separate instruments.



######### 19161.  
Upon institution of proceedings pursuant to Section 19160, if the governing body determines that it will be just and equitable and in the public interest for the additional cost, if any, of installation and maintenance of additional lights to be paid by the district as a whole, it shall immediately estimate the cost of installing and maintaining the additional lights, and shall use such reserve funds as may have been accumulated for such purposes to the extent necessary. In the regular tax levy for the first fiscal year in which it is possible to do so, the governing body shall include a tax upon the taxable property within the district at the equalized value thereof, or an assessment on each parcel of real property within the district on the basis of the estimated benefit to the parcel, sufficient to pay the cost of installing and maintaining for one year the additional lights. If sufficient reserve funds are available or will be available from the tax or assessment levy already made, or after the tax or assessment levy has been made, the governing body shall proceed with the installation of the additional lights.



######### 19161.1.  
Whenever the board of supervisors levies an assessment authorized by this chapter for the installation or maintenance of lights, the assessment shall be levied pursuant to Chapter 6.1 (commencing with Section 54701) of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code.



######### 19162.  
If the governing body determines that it will not be just and equitable, or in the public interest, for the cost of installation and maintenance of said additional lights to be paid by the district as a whole, it shall terminate the proceedings without prejudice to the filing of a new petition pursuant to Chapter 17 of this part.








##### CHAPTER 9.5. Replacement of Obsolete Lighting System in Existing District [19165 - 19177]  

######### 19165.  
Upon the receipt of a petition signed by owners of taxable property representing 60 percent or more of the total assessed valuation of all taxable property within an existing highway lighting district, or within a temporary zone requested to be established by the petition in the manner provided in this chapter, the governing body of the district may replace an obsolete lighting system with a new modern county- or utility-owned lighting system where necessary for the proper operation of the district or of the portion thereof lying within the temporary zone.



######### 19165.1.  
As an alternative to the petition procedure, the board of supervisors, by a four-fifths vote, may determine that the public safety and convenience require replacement of an obsolete system. The resolution may propose that a temporary zone be established, which zone will be benefited by the work, for the purpose of levying a special tax in the zone to finance the cost of the work.

The resolution shall contain that matter required by Section 19166.  Notice and hearing of the resolution shall be substantially as required by Sections 19168 and 19169.  If the board of supervisors  determines at the hearing, by a four-fifths vote, that it is just and equitable and in the public interest that the obsolete lighting be replaced and that the proposed temporary zone be formed, it shall fix and describe the boundaries of the proposed zone in a manner so as to exclude any territory which will not be benefited by inclusion in the zone; it shall declare the zone established; it shall designate the zone by a name or number; and it shall specify the duration and purposes of the zone, not to exceed 10 years from the beginning of the next ensuing fiscal year in which a special tax levy may be made in the zone.

Except as provided in this section, any zone formed under this section is subject to Chapter 9.5 (commencing with Section 19165).



######### 19166.  
A petition asking for the removal of obsolete lights and their replacement with modern county- or utility-owned lights pursuant to this chapter may request the board of supervisors to establish a temporary zone consisting solely of contiguous territory within the district which will be benefited by the replacement lights, for the purpose of levying a special tax therein to finance the cost of removal of the old lights and installation and temporary maintenance of the new lights. The petition shall contain all of the following:

(a) A general description of the nature of the proposed replacement lights, together with a map showing the location thereof.

(b) An estimate of all costs or charges which will be incurred in connection with the removal of the old lights and the installation of the new lights, together with a statement as to the period of time, not to exceed three years, proposed for the payment of the costs or charges.

(c) An estimate of the average monthly cost of maintenance of the replacement lights.

(d) A description of the boundaries of the proposed temporary zone.

A proposal to form a temporary zone pursuant to this section is subject to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 58850) of Title 6 of Division 2 of the Government Code to the same extent as a proposal to form a district.



######### 19167.  
Upon the presentation of a petition pursuant to this chapter, the clerk of the board of supervisors shall immediately refer the same to an appropriate county officer, who shall certify to the board the number of owners of taxable property within the boundaries of the district or the proposed zone whose names appear on said petition, together with the percentage of the total assessed valuation of all taxable property within the boundaries of the district or zone, which said signatures represent.



######### 19168.  
If the certifying officer certifies that the petition bears the signatures of owners of taxable property within the district or, if applicable, the proposed zone representing 60 percent or more of the total assessed value of all taxable property therein, the petition shall be filed, and the board of supervisors shall fix a time for hearing the petition and the protests of interested parties, and shall cause a notice of the filing of the petition and the time set for the hearing to be published pursuant to Section 6061 of the Government Code in a newspaper designated by said board as most likely to give notice to the inhabitants of the district and, if applicable, the proposed zone. If there is no such newspaper, copies of the notice shall be posted in three conspicuous places in the territory included in the district or, if applicable, the proposed zone, for three weeks prior to the date fixed for hearing the petition. The notice shall contain the text of said petition, but the names of the signers of the petition need not be published.

If the certifying officer’s certificate shows that any petition requesting the establishment of a temporary zone does not bear the required number of signatures, the request for the formation of a temporary zone shall be denied, without prejudice to the filing of a new petition therefor.

In such event, or if the petition does not request the establishment of a temporary zone, and the certifying officer’s certificate shows that the petition does not bear the signatures of owners of taxable property representing 60 percent or more of the total assessed valuation of all taxable property within the existing highway lighting district, the petition shall be denied.



######### 19169.  
Upon the date fixed for the hearing, or at any time to which it is continued, the board of supervisors shall, in addition to any other proceedings required by law, consider the request for formation of a temporary zone and any objections which may be filed against it or against the formation of the proposed zone.



######### 19170.  
If the board of supervisors determines with respect to a petition for the replacement of lights filed in conformity with this chapter, that

(a) It is just and equitable, and in the public interest, that the obsolete lighting system be replaced as provided in this chapter and that the proposed temporary zone be formed, and

(b) The petition was signed by resident taxpayers representing 60 percent or more of the total assessed valuation of all taxable property within the territory proposed to be formed into a zone,

the board shall by resolution, entered in its minutes, fix and describe the boundaries of the proposed zone in such manner that any territory which will not be benefited by inclusion therein, or which is not contiguous thereto, or which is not described in the petition, shall not be included therein; shall declare the zone established, designating it by an identifying name or number; and shall specify the purposes and duration thereof, not to exceed 10 years from the beginning of the next ensuing fiscal year in which a special tax or assessment levy may be made in the zone.



######### 19171.  
With respect to a petition for the replacement of lights which includes no request for the establishment of a temporary zone, if the board of supervisors determines that it will be just and equitable and in the public interest for the additional cost, if any, of removing the obsolete lighting system and its replacement with a modern county- or utility-owned lighting system to be paid by the district as a whole, the board of supervisors shall immediately estimate the cost of replacement of the obsolete system and installation and maintenance of the modern system, and shall include in the regular tax levy for the first fiscal year in which it is possible to do so, a tax upon the taxable property within the district at the equalized value thereof, or an assessment on each parcel of real property within the district on the basis of the estimated benefit to the parcel, sufficient to pay such cost of replacement, installation and maintenance. After the tax or assessment levy has been made, the governing body shall proceed with the replacement of the obsolete system and the installation and maintenance of the modern system.



######### 19172.  
The provisions of Sections 19036 and 19037 apply to proceedings under this chapter.



######### 19173.  
A statement regarding the boundaries of a zone established pursuant to this chapter shall be filed as provided by Chapter 8, Part 1, Division 2, Title 5 of the Government Code, together with a statement as to the period of duration of said zone specified in the resolution establishing it.



######### 19174.  
In order that the obsolete system may be removed and a modern system installed in its place and maintained immediately after the action of the board pursuant to Section 19170, the governing body may authorize the immediate removal of the obsolete system in the said zone and the installation of the modern system in said zone, and may contract to pay any costs or charges incurred by reason of such removal and such installation in equal periodic payments over a period of not to exceed the period of duration of said zone specified in the resolution establishing it.



######### 19175.  
The board of supervisors may, from time to time, transfer moneys to the district, for the benefit of the zone, from any available funds of the county. Any moneys so transferred are hereby appropriated, and shall be used, for the payment of any currently payable expenses incurred by reason of the removal of the obsolete system and the installation of the modern system proposed for the zone, and for the cost of maintenance thereof prior to December 1st of the first fiscal year in which a special tax or assessment may be levied in and on behalf of the zone. All costs of maintenance of the modern system, subsequent to that date, shall be budgeted and included in the general levy of taxes or assessments, as the case may be, in and on behalf of the district as a whole.



######### 19176.  
The board of supervisors shall, in the first fiscal year in which a special tax or assessment, as the case may be, may be levied in and on behalf of the zone, levy a special tax or assessment upon the taxable property therein for the purposes of the zone, and shall include in the levy a sum sufficient to repay to the county the amounts transferred to the district pursuant to Section 19175. The amounts so transferred shall be retransferred to the county treasury from the first available receipts from the special levy in the zone.

Thereafter, in the succeeding fiscal year or years during which the temporary zone remains in existence, the board of supervisors shall levy a special tax or assessment therein sufficient to pay any additional costs or charges incurred by reason of the removal of the obsolete system and the installation of the modern system therein, which may by contract be made payable in such year or years.

All special taxes or assessments levied in and on behalf of a zone, pursuant to this section, are in addition to any taxes or assessments levied therein for and on behalf of the district as a whole.



######### 19176.1.  
Whenever the board of supervisors levies an assessment authorized by Section 19176, the assessment shall be levied pursuant to Chapter 6.1 (commencing with Section 54701) of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code.



######### 19177.  
A zone shall remain in existence for the period of time specified in the resolution of the board of supervisors which established it, and shall thereafter automatically terminate; provided, there are then no outstanding obligations payable from special taxes or assessments to be levied in the zone.








##### CHAPTER 11. Disposition of Funds [19200 - 19202]  

######### 19200.  
The revenue derived from the special tax, together with all other moneys acquired by the district, shall be paid into the county treasury to the credit of the lighting fund of the district subject only to the order of the governing body and shall be expended by it only for and on behalf of the district.



######### 19201.  
Any funds arising from assessments made under this part remaining in the county treasury after the payment of all outstanding legal obligations incurred by the district, shall be ordered transferred by the governing body to the city treasurer of any city that has been incorporated since the formation of the district, and which includes the district or a considerable portion thereof within its corporate limits. If no such city has been incorporated then the funds so remaining in the county treasury shall be transferred to a separate fund and upon the order of the governing body shall be repaid pro rata to the persons by whom the assessments were originally paid.



######### 19202.  
The governing body of any highway lighting district may provide for the establishment of an accumulative capital outlay fund for the replacement of obsolete lighting system equipment. The fund shall be kept in reserve until appropriated in whole or in part to a specific project.

At any time after the creation of the fund the governing body may transfer to it any unencumbered surplus funds remaining on hand at the end of the fiscal year after the payment of the expenses of the district.








##### CHAPTER 12. Annexation of Territory [19210 - 19215]

######### 19211.  
At the first regular meeting after the petition has been filed with it, the board of supervisors shall fix a time for hearing the petition and the protests of interested parties, and shall cause a notice of the filing of the petition and the time set for the hearing to be published pursuant to Section 6061 of the Government Code and not less than one week prior to that time in a newspaper published and circulated in the county in which the district is situated. If there is no such newspaper, copies of the notice shall be posted in three conspicuous places in the territory to be annexed, for three weeks prior to the date fixed for hearing the petition.



######### 19212.  
Upon the date fixed for the hearing, or at any time to which it is continued, the board of supervisors shall consider the petition, and any objections which may be filed against it or against the annexation of any territory to the district.

The board of supervisors may by order entered on its minutes grant the petition either in whole or in part, and by order entered on its minutes alter the boundaries of the district, and annex thereto all or such portion of the contiguous territory described in the petition as will be benefited by inclusion in the district.



######### 19213.  
Any territory which will not be benefited, by inclusion in the district, or which is not contiguous to the district, or which is not described in the petition, shall not be included in the district.



######### 19214.  
The order of annexation shall be conclusive evidence of the validity of all prior proceedings leading to the annexation recited therein and after the making of the order, the territory shall become a part of the lighting district and shall be taxed, together with the remainder of the district, for all taxes thereafter levied by the board of supervisors for the maintenance of the district.



######### 19215.  
If a petition, signed by 15 or more taxpayers and residents of the area sought to be annexed, but less than the number of owners representing one-fourth of the amount of assessed value of real property in that area and less than the number of owners specified in subdivision (d) of Section 19210 of this chapter, is presented to the board of supervisors, the board, if the petition for such annexation expressly requests them so to do, shall order an election within the territory sought to be annexed.

The election shall be ordered by the board of supervisors at a hearing, after establishing the boundaries.  To the extent applicable, the election shall be called and conducted in the same manner as an election for formation.

If a majority of votes cast are in favor of the proposition of annexing the territory to the district, such territory shall become a part of the highway lighting district.








##### CHAPTER 13. Withdrawal of Territory [19230 - 19234]  

######### 19230.  
Any portion of the territory of a highway lighting district may be withdrawn therefrom.

######### 19232.  
At least 10 days before the time fixed for the hearing the board of supervisors shall publish a notice of the hearing by one insertion in the newspaper circulated in the district which the board believes will best serve to give notice to the inhabitants of the district of the proposed withdrawal of territory. The notice shall also be posted at least one week prior to the time fixed for the hearing in three public places within the district, one of which shall be within the portion of the district proposed to be withdrawn.



######### 19233.  
Any person interested may appear at the hearing and object to the withdrawal of territory from the district or may object to the continuance of the remaining territory as a highway lighting district. The board of supervisors shall consider and pass upon all objections, and the board of supervisors may order the withdrawal or may grant the petition for withdrawal either in whole or in part, and by resolution declare the district reestablished excluding from the district the territory withdrawn if it finds that one or more of the following facts exist:

(a) The territory to be withdrawn will be benefited by withdrawal.

(b) The withdrawal will allow economies and efficiencies in administration or operation of an existing lighting system in the territory to be withdrawn.

The decision of the board of supervisors on all objections and protests which are made shall be final and conclusive.



######### 19234.  
Upon the withdrawal of any territory from the district, the remaining territory in the district shall continue as a lighting district until dissolved. No withdrawal of territory shall become effective until any outstanding contract for service has expired or such contract has, with the consent of the person furnishing such service, been modified or canceled so as to relieve the district of further obligation to pay for future lighting service within the territory withdrawn.








##### CHAPTER 14. Dissolution by Petition [19250 - 19253]  

######### 19250.  
Proceedings for the dissolution of the district may be instituted by filing with the board of supervisors a petition signed by 50 or more property owners and residents of the district, asking for its dissolution. The board of supervisors shall, within 30 days after receiving the petition, by resolution, order that an election be held in the district for the determination of the question of dissolution. The election shall be called and conducted in the same manner as other elections of the district.



######### 19251.  
If a majority of the votes cast at the election held in the district for determination of the question of dissolution are in favor of dissolution, the district shall be dissolved.



######### 19252.  
Upon the dissolution of the district the title to any property which it may have acquired shall vest in any city which has at that time a considerable portion of the territory of the lighting district within its boundaries. If there is no such city, the title to the property shall vest in the board of supervisors of the county wherein the district is situated until such a city is created.



######### 19253.  
If at the time of the election to dissolve the district there is any indebtedness of the district outstanding, the vote to dissolve shall dissolve the district for all purposes except the levy and collection of taxes or assessments, as the case may be, for the payment of such outstanding indebtedness. From the time the district is thus dissolved until the indebtedness is fully paid, the legislative body of the city which is entitled to the property of the district as provided for in Section 19252 or, if there is no such city, the board of supervisors of the county wherein the district is located shall be the ex officio governing body of the district. That body shall levy such taxes or assessments and perform such other acts as may be necessary to pay the outstanding indebtedness of the district.








##### CHAPTER 15. Dissolution by Annexation or Incorporation Proceedings [19270 - 19274]  

######### 19270.  
Upon the inclusion of all of the territory embraced in any highway lighting district within one or more incorporated cities, either by annexation proceedings or by the incorporation of the cities, the district may be dissolved. Such dissolution shall be effective upon the filing with the State Board of Equalization, the governing body of the district, and the county assessor of a copy of a resolution of the legislative body of the city, or of a joint resolution of the legislative bodies of all the cities, declaring the district dissolved. The remaining unencumbered funds of the district shall be distributed and administered as provided in this chapter. No tax or assessment shall be levied after dissolution.

Any one city may withdraw its territory from the district in the manner provided by Section 19290.



######### 19271.  
If all of the territory of the district is included within one incorporated city, the money paid into the lighting fund shall be paid to the treasurer of that city, and administered by the legislative body thereof. The city legislative body shall have all of the powers and perform all of the duties granted to or imposed upon the board of supervisors of the county in which the district is located and shall carry out the provisions of this part as to such district to the same purpose and extent as if originally constituted the governing body thereof. The city shall be liable for all outstanding liabilities of the district incurred prior to the time the district was included within the city.



######### 19272.  
If all of the territory of the district is included within more than one incorporated city, then such proportionate part of the money paid into the lighting fund shall be paid to the treasurer of each such city as the area of that portion of the district included in that city bears to the total area of the district. The funds so paid shall be administered by the legislative body of each such city, and each of the said legislative bodies shall have all the powers and perform all of the duties, so far as that portion of the district within its boundaries is concerned, granted to or imposed upon the board of supervisors of the county in which the district is located and shall carry out this part as to the portion of the district included within its boundaries to the same purpose and extent as if orginally constituted the governing body thereof.



######### 19273.  
Each city shall be liable for such proportionate part of all the outstanding liabilities of the district incurred prior to its inclusion within the cities as the area of that portion of the district included in each city bears to the total area of the district.



######### 19274.  
After all of its territory has been included in one or more cities, and the district has been dissolved, upon the expenditure of its funds and the discharge of the district’s obligations by the city or cities, the powers and duties of the city or cities set forth in Sections 19271, 19272, and 19273 shall terminate.

######### 19280.  
(a) A district organized under this part may be dissolved by resolution of the board of supervisors if all of the territory in the district has been annexed to a maintenance district for street lighting organized pursuant to Chapter 26 (commencing with Section 5820), Part 3, Division 7 and which shall provide service to the area and shall assume all of the assets and liabilities of the dissolved district.

Subsequent to annexation into a maintenance district for street lighting, and the dissolution of the highway lighting district formed pursuant to this part, all of the property tax revenues that would have accrued to the highway lighting district formed pursuant to this part, if it had remained a highway lighting district, shall accrue to the annexing maintenance district.

######### 19303.  
If the certifying officer certifies that the petition bears the signatures of the owners of taxable property within the proposed zone representing 60 percent or more of the total assessed value of all taxable property in the zone, the petition shall be filed, and the board of supervisors shall fix a time for hearing the petition and the protests of interested parties, and shall cause a notice of the filing of the petition and the time set for the hearing to be published pursuant to Section 6061 of the Government Code in a newspaper designated by the board as most likely to give notice to the inhabitants of the district and the proposed zone.

The notice shall contain the text of the petition, but the names of the signers of the petition need not be published. Notice given pursuant to this section is a sufficient compliance with Section 19211.

If the certifying officer’s certificate shows that the petition does not bear the required number of signatures, the request for the formation of a temporary zone shall be denied, without prejudice to the filing of a new petition therefor, and the board of supervisors shall proceed to consider and act upon the petition as a petition filed pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 19160) or Chapter 12 (commencing with Section 19210), as the case may be.

(c) That the petition was signed by resident taxpayers representing 60 percent or more of the total assessed valuation of all taxable property within the area therein proposed to be annexed,

the board, in addition to those proceedings required by Chapter 12, shall by resolution entered in its minutes, declare the annexed territory established as a temporary zone with boundaries coterminous with the boundaries of the territory annexed, designating the zone by an identifying name or number; and shall specify the purposes and duration thereof, not to exceed three years from the beginning of the next ensuing fiscal year in which a special tax or assessment levy may be made therein.

In order that the lights proposed to be installed and maintained in a zone may be installed therein immediately after its formation, the governing body may authorize the immediate installation of the proposed lights in said zone, and may contract to pay any costs or charges incurred by reason of such installation in equal periodic payments over a period not to exceed the period of duration of said zone specified in the resolution establishing it.



######### 19310.  
The board of supervisors may, from time to time, transfer moneys to the district, for the benefit of the zone, from any available funds of the county. Any moneys so transferred shall bear interest at a rate to be fixed by the board of supervisors and are hereby appropriated, and shall be used, for the payment of any currently payable expenses incurred by reason of the installation of the lights proposed for the zone, and for the cost of maintenance thereof prior to December 1st of the first fiscal year in which a special tax or assessment may be levied in and on behalf of the zone.

The board of supervisors shall, in the first fiscal year in which a special tax or assessment, as the case may be, may be levied in and on behalf of the zone, levy a special tax or assessment upon the taxable property therein for the purposes of the zone, and shall include in the levy a sum sufficient to repay to the county the amounts transferred to the district pursuant to Section 19310. The amounts so transferred shall be retransferred to the county treasury from the first available receipts from the special levy in the zone.

Thereafter, in the succeeding fiscal year or years during which the temporary zone remains in existence, the board of supervisors shall levy a special tax or assessment therein sufficient to pay any additional costs or charges incurred by reason of the installation of the lights therein, which may by contract be made payable in such year or years.

All special taxes or assessments levied in and on behalf of a zone, pursuant to this section, are in addition to any taxes or assessments levied therein for and on behalf of the district as a whole.



######### 19311.1.  
(a) The board of supervisors shall not levy assessments pursuant to Section 19311 unless it has adopted an ordinance to do so.  The board of supervisors shall place before the voters of the zone, either before the initial ordinance takes effect or within one year thereafter, the question whether the district shall be authorized to levy assessments.

If the majority of those voting disapprove of such authority, no subsequent ordinance levying assessments for any succeeding fiscal year shall be adopted by the board of supervisors without the prior approval of the voters of the zone.

Subsequent election or elections to secure such approval shall not be held more than once a year.

(b) The approval of the voters may be secured at a district or countywide election, or by a ballot mailed to each property owner or registered voter of the zone.

A zone shall remain in existence for the period of time specified in the resolution of the board of supervisors which established it, and shall thereafter automatically terminate; provided, there are then no outstanding obligations payable from special taxes or assessments to be levied in the zone.



######### 19313.  
Where the board of supervisors or legislative body has so declared in its resolution of intention to order the formation of a lighting district or any annexation thereto, the board of supervisors or legislative body may, in its resolution ordering the formation of a lighting district or any annexation thereto, order the district divided into tax assessment zones. Tax assessment zones may be formed at a time other than at the formation of the district or any annexation thereto if pursuant to the same procedure of resolution, notice, and hearing as are applicable under this chapter to the annexation of territory.

No district shall be divided into zones unless the board of supervisors or legislative body finds that a tax assessment zone requires special services or special facilities in addition to those provided generally by the lighting district or the replacement of obsolete equipment, and that the tax levy is commensurate with the special benefits to be provided in the zone.  The boundaries of tax assessment zones may be changed or a zone may be dissolved in the same manner that a zone may be formed in an existing district.



######### 19314.  
If a highway lighting district is divided into tax assessment zones, the board of supervisors or legislative body may determine what portion of the amount of money to be secured from the levy of taxes shall be secured from such zone within the district.

The tax collector shall, when any assessment is delinquent, mark opposite the assessment the word “delinquent,” and shall add 10 per cent to the amount of the assessment.



######### 22140.  
As an alternative method for the collection of assessments levied under this part, the council, after the adoption of the resolution ordering the improvement, may order the assessment roll prepared by the city forester, showing the amount of the assessment against each lot or parcel of land, to be turned over to the assessor and the tax collector of the city, whereupon it shall be the duty of said officers to add the amount of said assessments to the next regular bill for taxes levied against the said lot or parcel of land for city purposes. Where city taxes are collected by the county officials, said assessment roll shall be delivered to the county auditor, who shall enter the amount thereof on the county assessment book opposite the description of the lot or parcel of land, and the amount shall be collected together with all other taxes thereon against the lot or parcel of land; provided, that said assessment roll shall be delivered to the county auditor before the date fixed by law for the delivery of the assessment books to the county board of equalization. Thereafter said amount shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as city taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and interest and to the same procedure under foreclosure and sale, in case of delinquency, as provided for city taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of city taxes are hereby made applicable to such special assessment taxes.



######### 22141.  
The city council shall have the power, in its discretion, to determine that the payment of such assessments may be made in annual installments, in any event not to exceed five, and that the payments of assessments so deferred shall bear interest on the unpaid balance at a rate to be determined by the city council, not to exceed 5 per cent per annum. All such determinations shall be expressed in the resolution of intention.

In the event that it is determined that such assessments may be paid in installments, the notice required in Section 22136 of this code shall so state, and the unpaid assessments shall not be delinquent until the expiration of a period of 30 days from the date upon which such installment was due and payable.



######### 22142.  
The lien, whether bonds issued to represent the assessment or otherwise, shall be subordinate to all fixed special assessment liens previously imposed upon the same property, but it shall have priority over all fixed special assessment liens which may thereafter be created against the property.








##### CHAPTER 7. Sale and Redemption of Delinquent Property [22160 - 22178]  

######### 22160.  
The tax collector shall, within 30 days after the date of delinquency, begin the publication or posting of a notice that the lots or parcels of land upon which the assessments have not been paid will be sold.

At any time after the delinquency and prior to the sale of any lots or parcels of land, any person may redeem the property by paying the delinquent assessment thereon, together with the penalties and costs and, if the payment is made after the first publication or posting of notice of sale, the cost of advertising.



######### 22165.  
At the time and place stated in the notice the tax collector shall proceed with the sale, commencing at the head of the list of the lots and parcels of land contained in the notice and continuing in the numerical order thereof until all the lots and parcels are sold. He may postpone or continue the sale from day to day until it is completed. He shall separately sell each lot or parcel of land, or so much thereof as may be necessary to realize the amount of the delinquent assessment which is a lien on the same, together with the penalties and costs, and fifty cents ($0.50) for a certificate of sale. If there is no other purchaser, the lot or parcel shall be struck off to the city as purchaser.



######### 22166.  
The tax collector shall issue for each sale an original and a duplicate certificate of sale, which shall refer to the proceedings, describe the lot or parcel sold, and give the name of the purchaser and the amount for which the sale was made. He shall deliver the original certificate to the purchaser, and he shall keep the duplicate on file in his office.



######### 22167.  
At any time before the expiration of 12 months from the date of the sale, any property so sold may be redeemed by the payment to the tax collector of the amount for which it was sold, with an additional penalty of 20 per cent of that amount.

Upon redemption of any lot or parcel of land, the tax collector shall enter the fact and date of redemption upon the duplicate certificate of sale.



######### 22169.

######### 22171.  
The deed shall recite substantially the matters contained in the certificate of sale, any change of interest therein, and the fact that no person has redeemed the property.



######### 22172.  
The applicant for a deed shall pay the tax collector one dollar ($1) for making the deed. If the city is the purchaser no charge shall be made for making the deed.



######### 22173.  
At least 30 days before he applies for a deed, the purchaser or his successor in interest shall serve upon the owner of the property, and upon any occupant, a written notice setting forth:

(a) A description of the property.

(b) That the property has been sold for a delinquent assessment.

(c) The improvement for which the assessment was made.

(d) The amount for which the property was sold.

If the owner of the property can not with due diligence be found, the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place upon the property at least 30 days before the time specified in the notice at which the application for a deed will be made.



######### 22175.  
The applicant for a deed shall file with the tax collector an affidavit or affidavits showing that notice of the application has been given, and if the notice was not served personally on the owner of the property, that due diligence was used to find the owner. The tax collector shall file the affidavit or affidavits in his office.



######### 22176.  
The person redeeming shall, if he redeems after the filing of the affidavits and more than 11 months from the date of sale, pay, in addition to the other amounts required, three dollars ($3) for the service of notice and the making of the affidavits, which amount shall be paid over to the purchaser or his successor in interest in the same manner as other sums paid for redemption.



######### 22177.  
No deed for any property sold for a delinquent assessment shall be executed until the purchaser or his successor in interest has complied with all the provisions of this chapter and filed with the tax collector the proper affidavits.



######### 22178.  
The deed of the tax collector shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of all matters, recited therein, of the regularity of all proceedings prior to the execution thereof, and of title in the grantee.

The city treasurer shall place the funds in a special fund designated by the name of the improvement proceeding, and shall make payments out of that fund only for the purposes provided for in this part.



######### 22201.  
Payments out of the special fund shall be made by the city treasurer to the board as funds are required for the prosecution and completion of the improvement.



######### 22202.  
To expedite the making of the improvement, the city council may at any time transfer into the special fund out of any money in the general fund, any sums which it may deem necessary.

(a) The legislative body of any local agency may, by resolution, determine and declare that bonds shall be issued to finance the estimated cost of the proposed improvements described in Section 22525, other than the costs of maintenance and servicing, under either the Improvement Act of 1911 (Division 7 (commencing with Section 5000)) or the Improvement Bond Act of 1915 (Division 10 (commencing with Section 8500)).  Either Part 5 (commencing with Section 6400) of Division 7 or Division 10 (commencing with Section 8500), as the case may be, shall govern all proceedings relating to the issuance of those bonds.

The maximum term to maturity of any notes issued shall not exceed 10 years.

(b) The resolution shall generally describe the proposed improvements specified in Section 22525, set forth the estimated cost thereof, specify the number of annual installments and the fiscal years during which they are to be collected, and fix or determine the maximum amount of each annual installment necessary to retire the bonds or notes.  The amount of debt service to retire the bonds shall not exceed the amount of revenue estimated to be raised from assessments over 30 years.  The amount of debt service to retire the notes shall not exceed the amount of revenue to be raised from the assessments over 10 years.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, assessments levied to pay the principal of, and interest on, any bond or note issued pursuant to this section, shall not be reduced or terminated if doing so would interfere with the timely retirement of the debt.



######### 22663.  
Public property owned by any public agency and in use in the performance of a public function shall not be subject to assessment under this part unless the resolution of intention expressly provides that it shall be assessed. If the resolution provides that public property shall be assessed, the local agency conducting the proceedings shall be liable for payment of all amounts so assessed. Any such amounts shall be payable from the general fund of the local agency unless the resolution of intention designates some other fund.

In his preliminary report the district engineer shall also recommend an apportionment of the construction and other costs among the State, if any contribution is to be requested from it, and the counties comprising the district. The district engineer shall also recommend a method or methods for financing the project. Upon completion of the preliminary report the district engineer shall file it with the secretary of the board of directors.

######### 25176.  
Within 90 days after its receipt, the Department of Transportation, through its proper officers, shall consider and pass upon the report so filed. It may approve or reject the request for contribution, and may reject, approve, or modify the report, in whole or in part, or may suggest modifications thereof. Failure of the department to act on the report within the 90-day period shall operate as a rejection on the part of the state.



######### 25177.

######### 25202.  
Each board of supervisors shall cause a certified copy of its resolution adopting or rejecting the report of the project to be sent to the secretary of the board of directors of the district.

At any time prior to the approval of the report of the project by the board of supervisors of any county, the matter of the participation of the county in any issuance of bonds proposed in the report may be referred to a vote of the qualified electors of the county. Such reference shall be had upon the petition of 5 per cent of the registered electors of the county, or upon the resolution of the board of supervisors of the county.



######### 25206.  
The matter may be submitted at a special election called for that purpose or may be consolidated with any other election involving the entire county.  All laws governing county elections shall apply to the election in so far as they may be applicable.  The notice of election, in addition to the matters otherwise required, shall refer to the report of the project, a copy of which shall be on file in the office of the county elections official.



######### 25207.  
If at the election a two-thirds majority of the electors voting thereon do not approve the proposition, the county shall not participate in the issue of bonds proposed in the report of the project unless the same or any amended proposition for such participation is thereafter, at a subsequent election, approved by the electors.



######### 25208.

Upon receipt of the request, the board of supervisors shall undertake the condemnation and acquisition requested by the board of directors and the cost thereof shall be a proper deduction from any levy made by the district upon or within that county. Any excess in such cost over and above the amount of any such levy shall be paid to the county by the district out of any funds provided for that purpose. The proceedings required to be taken by any county or county officers under the provisions of this section may include the taking of possession prior to judgment of any property or rights-of-way necessary for district purposes.



######### 25281.  
If it is decided that any money authorized to be expended from the State Treasury shall be expended as required by Section 7 of Article XVI of the California Constitution, the Director of Transportation shall have the exclusive management and control of the expenditure, if the boards of supervisors of the several counties concerned assent to the relinquishment and transfer of such management and control.

If the completed improvement, or any portion thereof, is situated within a city, a copy of the resolution shall likewise be transmitted to the governing body of the city and, if it is a state highway, a copy of the resolution shall also be transmitted to the Director of Transportation.



######### 25321.  
Control of such completed improvement shall vest in the State, county or city having jurisdiction of the class of highways of which such completed improvement is a part upon receipt of the resolution of completion by the appropriate public officer or governing body thereof designated in the preceding section and the State, county or city, as the case may be, shall thereupon be liable for the future maintenance and care thereof.



######### 25322.  
The board of directors shall not adopt any resolution of completion until it obtains from the Director of Transportation a certificate in writing showing that the highway, or portion thereof, proposed to be surrendered to the county within which it is situated has been improved in accordance with the plans and specifications previously adopted therefor. Unless the highway, or portion thereof, has been improved under his supervision, the Director of Transportation shall not be required to furnish the certificate until the district engineer delivers his certificate to the Director of Transportation showing that the highway, or portion thereof, has been improved in accordance with the plans and specifications previously adopted.








##### CHAPTER 15. General Financing and County Levies [25340 - 25350]  

######### 25340.  
All moneys of the district applicable to the payment of improvement costs shall be placed in a fund designated “construction fund,” the moneys in which shall be disbursed by the treasurer of the district as ordered by the board of directors. This fund may be used to pay all improvement costs, all necessary engineering, legal and other operating costs of the district, including salaries of officers, agents and employees, and for the payment of the cost of the purchase and acquisition of all necessary property and rights of way required for any district project.

The proposed amount may be the total estimated amount payable under any contract awarded for improvement, or for any portion thereof, or for any excess of cost over the amount of any past levies already made for that purpose. There shall first be deducted from the amount of the levy any amount to be contributed thereto by the State and the balance of the levy shall be distributed among the several counties composing the district in the proportions set forth in the report of the board of directors.

The resolution shall specifically set forth the sum of money levied upon each county within the district and shall briefly recite the facts requiring the levy. After the adoption of the resolution a certified copy of the same shall be forthwith transmitted to the clerks of the several boards of supervisors of the counties composing the district. The counties shall then be obligated to pay the amount of the levy unless other provisions for financing are made.



######### 25346.  
The board of supervisors of each county shall, within 90 days after the resolution providing for the levy has been adopted by the board of directors, pay at least one-fifth of the total amount levied upon that county into the treasury of the district. The board of supervisors of each county is hereby authorized to and obligated to make such payment and may make payment of the entire amount of the levy made but not less than one-fifth of the total thereof. For the purpose of making the payment the board of supervisors of each county may utilize any funds of the county not otherwise allocated or appropriated, including any money received by the county from the State as the result of any tax or license upon motor vehicles or motor vehicle fuels.



######### 25347.  
If the board of supervisors of any county within the district does not pay the entire amount of any levy made upon it within 90 days, the board of directors of the district shall provide for financing the balance in not to exceed four additional annual installments.



######### 25348.  
The treasurer of the district shall, prior to the fifteenth day of August in each year, transmit to the board of supervisors of each county within the district a statement of the total sum to be collected within that county during the fiscal year in behalf of the district.

######### 25349.  
If, upon receiving the report of the district treasurer showing the amount to be raised within the county for the current year, the board of supervisors pays that amount out of any moneys of the county available for that purpose, no levy of district taxes within that county need be made for the year covered by that payment.



######### 25350.  
All district taxes shall be collected in behalf of the district by the proper county officers in the several counties in the district at the same time and in the same form and manner as county taxes, and district taxes shall become due and payable in the same time and manner as county taxes are due and payable and shall become delinquent at the same times and in the same proportionate amounts and bear the same proportionate penalties and interest after delinquency as do county taxes, and, unless expressly provided to the contrary, all laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of county taxes are hereby made applicable to district taxes.

######### 25374.  
If the report of the board of directors shows that the proposed project or any unit thereof, is estimated to cost more than one million dollars ($1,000,000), the board of directors may provide that any bonds issued to finance the same shall be extended over a period of not to exceed 15 annual installments, in which event the initial payment from each county within the district shall be not less than the sum obtained by dividing the total amount payable in each county by the number of installments in which the bonds are to be paid.

######### 25441.  
Funding bonds shall be dated as of the date of the resolution or order of the board of directors authorizing their issuance.



######### 25442.  
The board of directors may use any available moneys of the district, not already allocated to some other purpose, for the payment of any interest or principal due or past due upon any funding bonds of the district, and may advance moneys of the district for that purpose. If an advancement is made the district shall be entitled to reimbursement out of any levies thereafter made or any moneys thereafter collected and applicable to the payment of the funding bonds.

All funding bonds shall be signed by the treasurer of the district, attested by the secretary, and shall have the official seal of the district affixed thereto.

The principal and interest of the funding bonds shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America at the office of the treasurer of the district issuing the same.



######### 25445.  
All funding bonds shall be serial in character and approximately an even proportion of the total amount of each issue shall be payable annually. The amount of the principal due in each annual payment need not be exactly the same but with respect to each installment excepting the last may be made to differ not more than five hundred dollars ($500) from the amount obtained by dividing the total of the principal amount due under the bonds, by the number of installments. The last installment shall be for the balance of the total principal amount not provided to be paid in the previous installments.



######### 25446.  
The funding bonds shall be issued by the board of directors at such time and manner and in such amounts as may be required to meet the demands of the district, as may be determined by the board of directors. The form, denomination, rate of interest, time, place and manner of payment and all matters relating to such issuance shall be determined by the board of directors, but the rate of interest shall not exceed 6 per cent per annum.

The funding bonds so issued may be sold in such amounts and at such times and in such manner as the board of directors may determine, or they may be delivered to any contractor performing any work for the district, at par, in satisfaction of any sum due upon his contract.



######### 25447.  
In each district in which funding bonds have been issued there is hereby created a special fund to be designated “Joint Highway District No. ____ of the State of California Funding Bond Redemption Fund No. ____” (each such fund to be consecutively numbered within each district as created) for the discharge and payment of principal and interest on such bonds.



######### 25448.  
The treasurer of the district shall annually before the fifteenth day of August transmit to the several boards of supervisors within the funding district, a statement showing the amount to be raised in such year by the levy and collection of special assessment taxes upon the lands only, exclusive of improvements, within each county which is within the funding district and subject to be taxed for the payment of principal, interest and delinquencies upon any funding bonds of the district. The statement shall show the percentages of the total amount to be levied upon the lands in each county in accordance with the zones established for each such funding district. The engineer of the district shall cause to be prepared and filed in the office of the clerk of the board of supervisors of each county within the district, a map or plat showing the boundaries of the lands in each county which are within any funding district showing the boundaries of the zones therein and the percentage of the total assessment to be paid by each zone.



######### 25449.  
The special assessment taxes levied for the payment of funding bonds shall be independent of and distinct from any other levies authorized by this part and shall be levied, collected and enforced by the proper officers of the several counties within the district, in behalf of the joint highway district and in the same manner and by the same persons and at the same time and with the same penalties and interest as are taxes for county purposes, and all laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of taxes for county purposes are hereby made applicable to these special assessment taxes where such laws are not in conflict with the provisions of this part except that such special assessment taxes shall be levied and collected upon land only, exclusive of the improvements thereon.



######### 25450.  
It shall be the duty of the board of supervisors of each county within the district to annually cause to be levied upon the lands only, exclusive of improvements, within the county liable therefor the amounts reported to it by the treasurer of such district, which amounts shall be clearly sufficient to pay the principal and interest coming due or past due in such year upon any funding bonds of the district together with a sufficient amount to cover delinquencies.

######### 26201.  
Annually, at the time of levying county taxes, the board of supervisors shall levy a tax to be known as the “_______ (name of district) boulevard district tax,” sufficient to raise the amount estimated by the commission to be necessary for the purposes of the district for the ensuing fiscal year. The board of supervisors shall determine the rate of the tax by deducting 15 per cent for anticipated delinquencies from the total assessed value of the real property within the district, as it appears on the assessment roll of the county, and dividing the sum required to be raised, by the remainder of the total assessed value.



######### 26202.  
The tax so levied shall be computed and entered on the assessment roll by the county auditor, and if the board of supervisors fails to levy the tax the auditor shall do so. The tax shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as county taxes, and when collected shall be paid into the county treasury for the use of the district.

The provisions of law prescibing the manner of levying and collecting county taxes and the duties of the several county officers with respect to taxation are, so far as they are not in conflict with this part, applicable to taxation under this part.  Such officers shall be liable upon their several official bonds for the faithful discharge of the duties imposed upon them by this part.

All money raised by taxation which is authorized by this part shall belong to the district.

Bonds may be issued in accordance with the estimate in such amounts not exceeding the total amount of bonds authorized as will produce a sum sufficient to pay the cost of constructing or acquiring or both the works for which they were authorized and interest on the bonds so issued during the period of construction and six months thereafter. The failure to issue the full amount of bonds authorized shall not invalidate any bonds of the district.



######### 27243.

No county or portion thereof shall be annexed without first complying with those terms.



######### 27322.

Unless the proposition receives two-thirds of the votes cast at the election the county or part thereof shall not be annexed to the district.  If the proposition carries by two-thirds or more of the votes cast at the election the result of the election shall be certified to the Secretary of State by the county elections official and thereupon the Secretary of State shall give notice and call for protests in the same manner as upon the original incorporation of the district.



######### 27323.

##### ARTICLE 2. Planning [27530 - 27533]  

######### 27530.  
The Legislature finds and declares that since July 1, 1971, the district has been freed of bonded indebtedness. The prospective continuing role of the district and its responsibilities in the field of transportation are policy questions of major importance to the citizens of California, the people and communities regularly served by the Golden Gate Bridge, the district, and the Legislature.

It is desirable, therefore, that all concerned have a common basis for considering the issues and exercising judgment.  To this end, the district is directed to develop a transportation facilities plan.



######### 27531.  
The transportation facilities plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

(a) A definition of the district’s future responsibilities for providing transportation services.  Alternative proposals are encouraged.  Abolishment of the district should be one alternative, in which case recommendations should be made for necessary transfer of powers and duties.

(b) A priority schedule for assuming each of any proposed added responsibilities.

(c) Necessary changes in the district’s organizational structure in order to be responsive to any changed responsibilities.

(d) An estimate of the expenditures that may be necessary to support any added responsibilities.

(f) A long-range estimate of bridge revenues, operating costs, and net revenues that may be available as required to provide proposed transportation services. 

(g) A special element addressed to the interfacing of transportation modes.

(h) Explicit consideration must be given to the environmental and social values of the communities affected.

In developing the transportation facilities plan, the district shall hold public hearings so that interested persons and organizations are provided an opportunity to express their viewpoints.



######### 27533.

##### ARTICLE 3. Powers and Functions [27550 - 27566]  

######### 27550.  
The district may study, construct, acquire, improve, maintain, and operate any and all modes of transportation within or partly outside the district, including, but not limited to, water transportation; may join with any cities, counties, districts, or state agencies, or any combinations thereof, to study and to provide any such mode of transportation as may be deemed by the board to be reasonable and appropriate to provide or to assist in providing transportation within or partly outside the district; and may pay for or finance, in whole or in part, any such study and any such mode of transportation.



######### 27551.  
The district may not, prior to December 30, 1975, expend any of its funds to implement the addition of a second deck to the Golden Gate Bridge or any other proposed plan for transit services, other than for its interim system of buses and ferries.

It is the intention of the Legislature that the district’s interim system of buses and ferries shall be the system outlined in the district’s grant application to the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, dated May 21, 1971, entitled, “Application of the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transporation District for a Mass Transportation Capital Grant under the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964, as amended.”

The district, however, may expend the necessary funds for planning purposes, and for the acquisition of rights-of-way necessary, regardless of what type of transit system is proposed in the Golden Gate Corridor Transportation Facilities Plan submitted to the Legislature in April, 1971, and in the Golden Gate Corridor Transportation Facilities Plan—Phase II submitted to the Legislature in September, 1975.



######### 27552.  
If the district constructs any rail transit lines, such lines, and the rolling stock and other facilities therefor, shall be coordinated with the system of the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District.

If the district constructs any tunnel within the Geary Corridor in the City and County of San Francisco, such tunnel and its underground stations shall be constructed so that the conversion of such facilities to physically accommodate the equipment used by the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District can be accomplished at a minimum cost.



######### 27553.  
With respect to its ferryboat operations, the district shall not operate any charter or sightseeing services. However, the district may contract with any common carrier to provide such services and to employ the district’s boats, employees, facilities, or equipment for such purposes.



######### 27554.  
Prior to the expenditure of any funds for the bus transit and water transportation system of the district, the board shall determine:

(a) The amount which the counties, and the transit districts therein, served by the system shall contribute to the operation of the system for benefits derived from intracounty operation connected with, or related to, the system.  The method of computing and receiving such amount shall be the method provided for in the district’s Resolution No. 7030, adopted May 8, 1970.

(b) That the board of supervisors of these counties, and the transit districts therein, have made a commitment to contribute the amount specified in subdivision (a).



######### 27555.  
It is the intention of the Legislature that the district pursue all avenues to obtain federal financing for both its interim transit system and any long-range transportation facilities approved by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. Furthermore, the district shall take no action which may preclude it from obtaining federal grants-in-aid if such grants are reasonably anticipated.

The commission may permit authorized emergency vehicles, as defined in Section 165 of the Vehicle Code, responding to or returning from mutual aid calls or other emergencies, and other vehicles owned by any public agency when called upon to perform emergency work on the property of any toll bridge, tube, or other toll highway crossing, to cross toll bridges, tubes, or other toll highway crossings without paying a toll.



######### 30101.6.  
The commission shall grant toll-free passage on all toll bridges, tubes, and other toll highway crossings under its jurisdiction to members of the California Highway Patrol on duty.

Members of the California Highway Patrol, in all cases while on duty, are persons directly connected with the operation of toll bridges, tubes, and other toll highway crossings as such persons are designated in all of the bond resolutions adopted by the commission to authorize the issuance of bonds to finance the construction of toll structures.



######### 30101.7.  
(a) The commission shall grant toll free passage on all toll bridges, tubes, and other toll highway crossings under its jurisdiction to vehicles in a funeral procession of a person who died while on active duty with the armed services of the United States.

######### 30105.  
The commission may also grant permits to and enter into contracts with steam, electric, bus, railroad, and other transportation companies, public or private, and with any municipal or public corporation, public utility district, or political subdivision for the use of any toll bridge or other toll highway crossing, and for the use of the transportation facilities and the additional transportation facilities thereof, upon such terms and conditions as are mutually agreed upon if, prior to the granting of the permit or the execution of the contract, the commission first determines that the permit or contract is advisable or necessary for the financing of the bridge or other toll highway crossing or for the proper, necessary, or safe use of the bridge and for the best interests of the state.



######### 30106.  
The grant of any such permit or the execution of any such contract by the California Transportation Commission shall not relieve any transportation company or corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission from the duty of obtaining any certificate of public convenience and necessity for the conduct of a transportation service over any toll bridge or other highway crossing as required by law, or from the duty of complying with every lawful order, rule, or regulation of the Public Utilities Commission respecting such transportation service.



######### 30107.  
In any such contract or permit, the commission may authorize the transportation company or corporation, district, or political subdivision providing transportation to use the transportation facilities and additional transportation facilities of the commission upon such terms and in such manner as the commission deems proper. Such use may be authorized without restriction to the particular toll bridge or other highway crossing to which the transportation facilities and additional transportation facilities relate, but the use authorized shall be for or in aid of the transportation of persons or property over that bridge or other highway crossing or the approaches thereto.



######### 30108.  
Every contract which the commission enters into with, and every permit which it grants to, any person, or private, public, or municipal corporation, any district or political subdivision, for the transportation of persons or property by such person, or private, public, or municipal corporation, or district or political subdivision over any toll bridge or other toll highway crossing, or over the additional transportation facilities of any toll bridge or other toll highway crossing, shall contain a provision that no privilege or contract rights acquired by such person, private, public, or municipal corporation, district, or political subdivision, with regard to the transport of persons or property over any such toll bridge or with regard to additional transportation facilities, shall be an element of value in any subsequent condemnation proceeding against any such person, private, public, or municipal corporation, district, or political subdivision.



######### 30109.  
No privilege, permit, or contract right acquired by any such person, private, public, or municipal corporation, district, or political subdivision, with regard to the transport of persons or property over any such toll bridge or other toll highway crossing or with regard to use of or passage over any additional transportation facilities shall constitute an element of value in any condemnation proceeding.



######### 30110.  
The commission, in behalf of the State, by itself or its agents or assigns, or through the department or its agents or assigns, may operate the transportation facilities of any toll bridge or other highway crossing constructed or acquired pursuant to this chapter and the additional transportation facilities authorized to be constructed or acquired pursuant to this chapter. This power may be exercised upon default of any party contracting under Section 30104 or 30105 with the commission for the transportation of persons or property for hire over any toll bridge or other toll highway crossing, or upon the termination or cessation of any such contract or agreement, or in the absence of such contract or agreement.

Prior to the operation of any such transportation facilities by the commission or its agents or assigns or by the department or its agents or assigns, the commission shall first determine that the operation thereof is advisable or necessary for the financing of the bridge or other toll highway crossing, or for the proper or necessary use of the bridge or other toll highway crossing, and is for the best interests of the State.



######### 30111.  
The commission, the officials thereof, and all state officials may do such acts and make such agreements not inconsistent with law as are necessary or desirable in connection with the duties and powers conferred upon them respectively by law regarding the construction, maintenance, operation, and insurance of toll bridges or other highway crossings, and the transportation facilities thereof or thereto, or the safeguarding of the funds and revenues required for such purposes and the payment of the indebtedness incurred therefor.



######### 30112.  
The department and commission shall consider the inclusion of bicycle and pedestrian facilities on each new toll bridge designed and constructed pursuant to this division, including appropriate connections thereto. Such facilities shall be included on each such new bridge if the commission finds that they are economically and physically feasible. If the commission finds such facilities are not feasible, it shall report its findings to the Legislature at least one year prior to commencement of construction, including the facts on which the commission based its decision.

The cost of the bicycle and pedestrian facilities on the approaches to the toll bridge shall be paid by the commission as a part of the cost of construction of the toll bridge, unless the cost of such facilities is to be paid by a governmental agency other than a state agency.  The feasibility study for such facilities shall reflect whether the commission or a governmental agency other than a state agency shall pay the cost of such facilities.

The Legislature finds that the increased use of the bicycle is a desirable activity which should be encouraged by the improvement of access available to that mode of transportation.  It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this section, to provide for the use of toll bridges by both pedestrians and bicycles, wherever this is economically and physically feasible.



######### 30113.  
(a) The commission may utilize net revenues from toll bridges in order to finance research on high technology motion control devices to be used on the bridges.

(b) If the Metropolitan Transportation Commission allocates toll bridge net revenues as defined in Section 30884, it may utilize net revenues from the bridges under its jurisdiction to finance the research referred to in subdivision (a).

The department shall require of each contractor such bonds for the faithful performance of any contract or subcontract entered into pursuant to this chapter and for the payment for any labor, materials, or supplies used in, upon, for or about the performance of the work contracted to be done, fixing such terms and conditions, and in such amounts, as it deems to be for the best interests of the State. Money realized on any such bonds shall be paid into the acquisition and construction fund of the particular toll bridge or other highway crossing involved.



######### 30155.  
The commission may authorize the department to acquire or construct tubes, tunnels, subways, underpasses, or overpasses either in connection with bridges or as separate highway crossings whenever the department deems such acquisition or construction advisable. All of the provisions of this chapter shall be fully applicable to the tubes, tunnels, subways, underpasses, or overpasses, the acquisition and construction of which is so authorized, and they shall be included within the word “bridge.”

######### 30158.  
The department may issue permits for the use of any toll bridge or other toll highway crossing acquired or constructed pursuant to this chapter on a credit basis. Except in the case of municipal or other public corporations, governmental agencies, or common carriers having contracts directly with the commission for the operation of the transportation facilities of the bridge or crossing, and except as provided in Section 30161.5, the department shall require the holder of a permit for the use of any toll bridge or other toll highway crossing on a credit basis to furnish and maintain in force a bond executed by an admitted surety insurer, approved by the department, in an amount equal to twice the department’s estimate of the toll charges to be incurred under the permit during one month.



######### 30159.  
The department may revoke any permit granted for failure of the holder to comply with its terms.



######### 30160.  
The department may also require the holder of any such permit to pay a fee of not to exceed seven dollars ($7) a month and, in addition thereto, such other fee for each individual credit transaction which, when combined with the monthly fee, will cover the estimated printing and other overhead expense, the proceeds thereof to be deposited in the fund from which such expenses are paid.

In the first year of new service, the sponsor shall develop a reporting and accounting structure for the performance measures. Commencing with the third operating year, sponsors shall be subject to the approved performance measures.

(d) The Metropolitan Transportation Commission shall adopt a regional transit connectivity plan by May 1, 2006. The connectivity plan shall be incorporated into the commission’s Transit Coordination Implementation Plan pursuant to Section 66516.5 of the Government Code. The connectivity plan shall require operators to comply with the plan utilizing commission authority pursuant to Section 66516.5 of the Government Code. The commission shall consult with the Partnership Transit Coordination Council in developing a plan that identifies and evaluates opportunities for improving transit connectivity and shall include, but not be limited to, the following components:

(1) A network of key transit hubs connecting regional rapid transit services to one another, and to feeder transit services. “Regional rapid transit” means long-haul transit service that crosses county lines, and operates mostly in dedicated rights-of-way, including freeway high-occupancy vehicle lanes, crossing a bridge, or on the bay. The identified transit hubs shall operate either as a timed transfer network or as pulsed hub connections, providing regularly scheduled connections between two or more transit lines.

(2) Physical infrastructure and right-of-way improvements necessary to improve system reliability and connections at transit hubs. Physical infrastructure improvements may include, but are not limited to, improved rail-to-rail transfer facilities, including cross-platform transfers, and intermodal transit improvements that facilitate rail-to-bus, rail-to-ferry, ferry-to-ferry, ferry-to-bus, and bus-to-bus transfers. Capital improvements identified in the plan shall be eligible for funding in the commission’s regional transportation plan.

(3) Regional standards and procedures to ensure maximum coordination of schedule connections to minimize transfer times between transit lines at key transit hubs, including, but not limited to, the following:

(A) Policies and procedures for improved fare collection.

(B) Enhanced trip-planning services, including Internet-based programs, telephone information systems, and printed schedules.

(C) Enhanced schedule coordination through the implementation of real-time transit-vehicle location systems that facilitate communication between systems and result in improved timed transfers between routes.

(D) Performance measures and data collection to monitor the performance of the connectivity plan.

The connectivity plan shall focus on, but not be limited to, feeder transit lines connecting to regional rapid transit services, and the connection of regional rapid transit services to one another. The connectivity plan shall be adopted following a Metropolitan Transportation Commission public hearing at least 60 days prior to adoption. The commission shall adopt performance measures and collect appropriate data to monitor the performance of the connectivity plan. The plan shall be evaluated every three years by the commission as part of the update to its regional transportation plan. No agency shall be eligible to receive funds under this section unless the agency is a participant operator in the commission’s regional transit connectivity plan.

The provisions of this subdivision shall only be effective if the voters approve the toll increase as set forth in Section 30921, and the expenditures incurred by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission up to five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) that are related to the requirements of this subdivision, including any study, shall be reimbursed from toll revenues identified in paragraph (33) of subdivision (c) of Section 30914.

(e) The TransLink Consortium, per the TransLink Interagency Participation Agreement, shall, by July 1, 2008, develop a plan for an integrated fare program covering all regional rapid transit trips funded in full or in part by this section. “Regional rapid transit” means long-haul transit services that cross county lines, and operate mostly in dedicated rights-of-way, including freeway high-occupancy vehicle lanes, crossing a bridge, or on the bay. Interregional rail services, originating or terminating from outside the Bay Area, shall not be considered regional rapid transit. The purpose of the integrated fare program is to encourage greater use of the region’s transit network by making it easier and less costly for transit riders whose regular commute involves multizonal travel and may involve the transfer between two or more transit agencies, including regional-to-regional and regional-to-local transfers. The integrated fare program shall include a zonal fare system for the sole purpose of creating a monthly zonal pass (monthly pass), allowing for unlimited or discounted fares for transit riders making a minimum number of monthly transit trips between two or more zones. The number of minimum trips shall be established by the plan. The integrated fare program shall not apply to fare structures that are not purchased on a monthly basis. For the purposes of these zonal fares, geographic zones shall be created in the Bay Area. To the extent practical, zone boundaries for overlapping systems shall be in the same places and shall correspond to the boundaries of the local transit service areas. A regional rapid transit zone may cover more than one local service area, or may subdivide an existing local service area. The monthly pass shall be created in at least the following two forms:

(1) For the use of interzonal regional rapid transit trips without local transit discounts.

(2) For the use of interzonal regional rapid transit trips with local transit discounts. The plan may recommend the elimination of existing transit pass arrangements to simplify the marketing of the monthly pass. The integrated fare program shall establish a monitoring program to evaluate the impact of the integrated fare program on the operating finances of the participating agencies. The integrated fare program shall be adjusted as necessary to ensure that the program does not jeopardize the viability of local or regional rapid transit routes impacted by the program, and to the extent feasible, provide an equitable revenue-sharing arrangement among the participating agencies. This subdivision shall only be effective if the voters approve the toll increase as set forth in Section 30921, and any expenditures related to the implementation of this subdivision incurred by the TransLink Consortium shall be reimbursed by toll revenues designated in paragraph (34) of subdivision (c) of Section 30914.

(f) The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) shall, by September 29, 2007, adopt a Bay Area Regional Rail Plan (plan) for the development of passenger rail services in the San Francisco Bay Area over the short, medium, and long term. Up to six million dollars ($6,000,000) of the funds described in paragraph (33) of subdivision (c) of Section 30914 may be expended by MTC, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART), and the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board (Caltrain) for the plan. A project management team comprised of staff from MTC, Caltrain, the High-Speed Rail Authority, and BART shall provide day-to-day project management of the technical development of the plan. The plan shall formulate strategies to integrate passenger rail systems, improve interfaces with connecting services, expand the regional rapid transit network, and coordinate investments with transit-supportive land use. The plan shall be directed by a steering committee consisting of appointees from the Department of Transportation (Caltrans), BART, Caltrain, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), the Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority, the Altamont Commuter Express, the High-Speed Rail Authority, MTC, the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit District (SMART), the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, the Solano Transportation Authority, the Association of Bay Area Governments, the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, the Port of Oakland, the Alameda County Transportation Commission, the Contra Costa Transportation Authority, the Transportation Authority of Marin, the Napa County Transportation Planning Agency, the San Francisco County Transportation Authority, the San Mateo City-County Association of Governments, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, and the owners of standard gauge rail. Under direction from the steering committee and with input from Bay Area transit agencies, MTC shall act as the fiscal agent for the study and oversee consultant contracts on behalf of the project management team. The plan proposals shall be evaluated using performance criteria, including, but not limited to, transit-supportive land use and access, ridership, cost-effectiveness, regional network connectivity, and capital and operating financial stability. Additional performance criteria shall be developed as necessary. The plan shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following:

(1) Identification of issues in connectivity, access, capacity, operations, and cost-effectiveness.

(2) Identification of opportunities to enhance rail connectivity and to maximize passenger convenience when transferring between systems, including the study of the feasibility and construction of an intermodal transfer hub at Niles (Shinn Street) Junction.

(3) Recommendation of improvements to the interface with shuttles, buses, other rail systems, and other feeder modes.

(4) Identification of potential impacts on capacity constraints and operations on existing passenger and freight carriers.

(5) Identification of bottlenecks where added capacity could cost-effectively increase performance.

(6) Recommendation of potential efficiency improvements through economies of scale, such as through joint vehicle procurement and maintenance facilities.

(7) Recommendation of strategies to acquire right-of-way and station property to preserve future service options.

(8) Identification of potential capital and operating funding sources for proposed actions.

(9) Identification of locations where the presence of passenger rail could stimulate redevelopment and thereby direct growth to the urban core.

(10) Recommendation of technology-appropriate service expansion in specific corridors. Technologies to be considered include conventional rail transit modes, bus rapid transit, and emerging rail technologies. Identify phasing strategies for the implementation of rail services where appropriate.

(11) Examination of how recommendations would integrate with proposed high-speed rail to the Central Valley and southern California. The intent of this element of the study is to help reduce the number of alternatives that the High-Speed Rail Authority would need to evaluate as part of any follow-on environmental assessment of future high-speed rail system access to the Bay Area. Selection of a preferred alignment for the Bay Area shall remain the responsibility of the High-Speed Rail Authority pursuant to Section 185032 of the Public Utilities Code.

(12) Recommendation of a governance strategy to implement and operate future regional rail services.

This subdivision shall only be effective if the voters approve the toll increase as set forth in Section 30921. Any expenditures incurred by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission or the project sponsors identified in paragraph (33) of subdivision (c) of Section 30914 related to the requirements of this subdivision, including any study and administration, shall be appropriate charges against toll revenue to be reimbursed from toll revenues.

(A) WETA shall adopt a plan that includes systemwide and route-specific performance measures related to fare-box recovery, ridership, and any other measures as deemed appropriate by WETA in consultation with MTC.

(B) WETA and MTC shall execute an operating agreement that establishes a five-year plan for new or enhanced services and outlines incremental steps needed to achieve a reasonable level of service productivity and cost-effectiveness as compared to similar ferry services provided across the bay area.

(C) After the time period identified in subparagraph (B), and if reasonable, but incomplete progress has been achieved to meet the performance measures identified in subparagraph (A), WETA, in consultation with MTC, may propose a new timeframe, not longer than an additional five years, to achieve the performance measures and take needed steps to remedy the service to meet the measures. In the event that the performance measures are not met within the new timeframe, WETA may seek additional time to achieve the measures and MTC may determine whether services should continue and may establish other conditions to service in consultation with WETA. In all cases, funds not spent or made available to WETA shall be returned to the reserve account established pursuant to clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2).

(D) WETA shall use the plan identified in subparagraph (A) to prioritize the use of capital funding made available by this section to support its mission as the operator of ferry services.

(E) This section does not restrict WETA with respect to meeting its obligations as the coordinating agency for water transit response to regional emergencies.

(d) (1) For all projects authorized under subdivision (a), the project sponsor shall submit an initial project report to the Metropolitan Transportation Commission within six months of the election approving the toll increase. This report shall include all information required to describe the project in detail, including the status of any environmental documents relevant to the project, additional funds required to fully fund the project, the amount, if any, of funds expended to date, and a summary of any impediments to the completion of the project. This report, or an updated report, shall include a detailed financial plan and shall notify the commission if the project sponsor will request toll revenue within the subsequent 12 months. The project sponsor shall update this report as needed or requested by the commission. Funds shall not be allocated by the commission for any project authorized by subdivision (a) until the project sponsor submits the initial project report, and the report is reviewed and approved by the commission.

(2) If multiple project sponsors are listed for projects listed in subdivision (a), the commission shall identify a lead sponsor in coordination with all identified sponsors, for purposes of allocating funds. For any projects authorized under subdivision (a), the commission shall have the option of requiring a memorandum of understanding between itself and the project sponsor or sponsors that shall include any specific requirements that must be met before the allocation of funds provided under subdivision (a).

(e) If a program or project identified in subdivision (a) has cost savings after completion, taking into account construction costs and an estimate of future settlement claims, or cannot be completed or cannot continue due to delivery or financing obstacles making the completion or continuation of the program or project unrealistic, the commission shall consult with the program or project sponsor. After consulting with the sponsor, the commission shall hold a public hearing concerning the program or project. After the hearing, the commission may vote to modify the program or the project’s scope, decrease its level of funding, or reassign some or all of the funds to another project within the same bridge corridor. If a program or project identified in subdivision (a) is to be implemented with other funds not derived from tolls, the commission shall follow the same consultation and hearing process described above and may vote thereafter to reassign the funds to another project consistent with the intent of this chapter.

(f) If the voters approve a toll increase pursuant to Section 30923, the authority shall within 24 months of the election date include the projects in a long-range bridge toll plan.

The authority shall provide at least 30 days’ notice to the transportation policy committee of each house of the Legislature and shall hold a public hearing before adopting a toll schedule reflecting the increased toll rate.

(b) The authority shall increase the toll rates specified in the adopted toll schedule in order to meet its obligations and covenants under any bond resolution or indenture of the authority for any outstanding toll bridge revenue bonds issued by the authority and the requirements of any constituent instruments defining the rights of holders of related obligations of the authority entered into pursuant to Section 5922 of the Government Code and, notwithstanding Section 30887 or subdivision (d) of Section 30916 of this code, or any other law, may increase the toll rates specified in the adopted toll schedule to provide funds for the planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, rehabilitation, and seismic retrofit of the state-owned toll bridges specified in Section 30910 of this code, to provide funding to meet the requirements of Sections 30884 and 30911 of this code, and to provide funding to meet the requirements of voter-approved regional measures pursuant to Sections 30914, 30921, and 30923 of this code.

(c) Notwithstanding any other law, the authority’s toll structure for the state-owned toll bridges specified in Section 30910 may vary from bridge to bridge and may include discounts consistent with the following:

(1) The authority may include discounts for the following vehicles:

(A) Vehicles classified by the authority as high-occupancy vehicles.

(B) Vehicles that pay for tolls electronically or through other non-cash methods. The authority may charge differential rates based on the chosen method.

(2) The authority shall provide a 50-percent discount on the amount of the toll increase approved pursuant to Section 30923 on the second bridge crossing for those commuters using a two-axle vehicle who pay tolls electronically or through other noncash methods and who cross two bridges specified in Section 30910 during commute hours. The authority shall establish reasonable and practical operating rules to implement this paragraph.

(d) If the authority establishes high-occupancy vehicle lane fee discounts or access for vehicles classified by the authority as high-occupancy vehicles for any bridge or segments of a highway that connect to the bridge, the authority shall establish the occupancy requirements that shall apply on each segment of highway that connects with that bridge, in consultation with the department.

(e) All tolls referred to in this section and Sections 30916, 31010, and 31011 may be treated by the authority as a single revenue source for accounting and administrative purposes and for the purposes of any bond indenture or resolution and any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 5922 of the Government Code.

(f) It is the intent of the Legislature that the authority should consider the needs and requirements of both its electronic and cash-paying customers when it designates toll payment options at the toll plazas for the toll bridges under its jurisdiction.



######### 30919.  
(a) Consistent with its adopted regional transportation plan, after the requirements for debt service on the outstanding toll bridge revenue bonds have been met, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission shall allocate the revenues identified in subdivision (b) of Section 30913 to eligible public entities and to the department.

(b) The revenues expended pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 30914 shall be expended on rail extension and improvement projects designed to reduce vehicular traffic congestion on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Seventy percent of the revenues shall be expended on rail extensions and improvement projects in the Counties of Alameda and Contra Costa, including, but not limited to, extending the regional rail system in the Concord-Antioch, Fremont-San Jose, and the Bayfair-Livermore rail transit corridors. The remaining 30 percent shall be expended on rail extensions and improvement projects in the City and County of San Francisco and the Counties of San Mateo and Santa Clara.

(c) The Metropolitan Transportation Commission may commit to multiyear allocations and expenditures for projects over extended time periods to maximize funding opportunities and project progress.



######### 30920.  
The authority may issue toll bridge revenue bonds to finance any or all of the projects, including those specified in Sections 30913, 30914, and 30914.7, if the issuance of the bonds does not adversely affect the minimum amount of toll revenue proceeds designated in Section 30913 and in paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of, and subdivision (b) of, Section 30914 for rail extension and improvement projects and transit projects to reduce vehicular traffic. A determination of the authority that a specific project or projects shall have no adverse effect will be binding and conclusive in all respects.

At such time as obligations of the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank secured by the seismic retrofit surcharge imposed under subdivision (a) of Section 31010 are no longer outstanding, as that term is defined in the constituent instruments defining the rights of the holders of those obligations, all revenues, interest earned, and existing fund balances in the Toll Bridge Seismic Retrofit Account shall be transferred to the authority for deposit in the Bay Area Toll Account.



######### 30958.  
After payments for debt service on outstanding bonds, and the costs for the operation and maintenance expenses set forth in Section 30952 are provided for, and after all direct operating costs of the authority are provided for, the authority may retain, for its cost in administering this article, an amount not to exceed 1 percent of the gross annual bridge revenues.



######### 30959.  
The authority may make direct contributions to the commission in furtherance of the exercise of the authority’s powers under this division, including contributions in the form of personnel services, office space, overhead, and other funding necessary to carry out the function of the authority, with those contributions not to exceed 1 percent of the gross annual bridge revenues. The authority may also make additional contributions in the form of loans to the commission on a reimbursement-for-cost basis; provided that those loans do not, independent of the direct contributions, exceed 1 percent of the gross annual bridge revenues and are fully repaid with interest at the same interest rate that would apply for toll bridge revenue bonds of the same duration as any loan taken by the commission. As used in this section, “gross annual bridge revenues” shall have the same meaning as in Section 30958.



######### 30960.  
(a) The authority may issue both defeasance and future capital project bonds payable from the revenues of the tolls imposed on the bridges described in Section 30910.  The bonds or commercial paper may be issued by the authority at any time, and from time to time, payable from the revenues from the tolls.  The bonds or commercial paper shall be referred to as “toll bridge revenue bonds.”

(b) The revenues from the tolls on the bridges described in Section 30910 shall be subject to a statutory lien in favor of the bondholders to secure all amounts due on the bonds and in favor of any provider of credit enhancement for the bonds to secure all amounts due to that provider with respect to those bonds, and the lien shall immediately attach to those toll revenues and be effective, binding, and enforceable against the authority, its successors, creditors, and all others asserting rights therein, irrespective of whether those parties have notice of the lien and without the need for any physical delivery, recordation, filing, or further act, and the toll revenues shall remain subject to that lien until all bonds are paid in full or provision made therefor, and the bridges shall not become toll-free prior to that time.

(c) The liens on toll revenues created by this chapter shall be subject to expenditures for operation and maintenance of the bridges, including toll collection, unless those expenditures are otherwise provided for by statute.

(d) Interest on any bonds issued pursuant to this chapter shall at all times be free from state personal income tax and corporate income tax.



######### 30961.  
Toll bridge revenue bonds shall be issued pursuant to a resolution adopted at any time, and from time to time, by the authority by a majority vote of all members of the authority.

(a) The authority may from time to time issue bonds in accordance with the Revenue Bond Law of 1941 (Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 54300) of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code), for the purpose of constructing, improving, or equipping any of the bridges or for any of the purposes authorized by this chapter, Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 30910), or Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 31000). Operation of the bridges or any grouping or units thereof shall constitute an “enterprise” within the meaning of Section 54309 of the Government Code, and the authority shall constitute a “local agency” within the meaning of Section 54307 of the Government Code. Article 3 (commencing with Section 54380) of Chapter 6 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code shall not apply to the issuance and sale of bonds pursuant to this chapter. Instead, the authority shall authorize the issuance of bonds by resolution, and that resolution shall specify all of the following:

The rate may be either fixed or variable and shall be payable at the times and in the manner specified in the resolution.

(b) The authority shall keep full and complete accounts for toll revenues and expenses of the toll bridges and shall annually prepare balance sheets showing the financial condition of the entire toll bridge enterprise as well as toll revenues and operating costs for each toll bridge. The accounts and related reports shall be maintained and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices and shall be subject to an annual audit conducted by an independent certified public accountancy firm licensed to practice in the state.

(c) The authority may issue toll bridge revenue bonds to provide the department with sufficient funds to combine with the unspent proceeds of outstanding obligations of the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank under Chapter 4.6 (commencing with Section 31070) to establish that those obligations are no longer outstanding, as that term is defined in the constituent instruments defining the rights of the holders of those obligations.

(d) As and when requested by the authority, the department and the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to promptly establish that obligations of the bank under Chapter 4.6 (commencing with Section 31070) are no longer outstanding and to effect the consolidation of toll revenues in accordance with Section 188.6.

The schedule shall include the timing and sources of the state contributions to the state toll bridge seismic retrofit and replacement program. The schedule shall provide for the state contributions to be made available for expenditure commencing in the fiscal year 2005-06, and in a manner that distributes the state contributions over the years during which construction of the toll bridge seismic retrofit and replacement program occurs, ensures that the state contributions provide a timely balance between those sources and the contribution from toll revenues, and, to the extent possible, minimizes the impact on state transportation programs. The schedule shall include and make available for expenditure, the state contribution identified in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (8) of subdivision (b) of Section 188.5 commencing in fiscal year 2008-09, and shall distribute it over that fiscal year and each of the fiscal years during which construction of the state toll bridge seismic retrofit and replacement program occurs. The California Transportation Commission, in consultation with the department and the authority, may update and revise the schedule as it determines is necessary.



######### 30962.  
Any bonds or commercial paper issued pursuant to this chapter are a legal investment for all trust funds; for the funds of insurance companies, commercial and savings banks, and trust companies; and for state school funds.  Whenever any money or funds may, by any law now or hereafter enacted, be invested in bonds of cities, counties, school districts, or other districts within the state, those funds may be invested in the bonds issued pursuant to this chapter, and whenever bonds of cities, counties, school districts, or other districts within this state may, by any law now or hereafter enacted, be used as security for the performance of any act or the deposit of any public money, the bonds issued pursuant to this chapter may be so used.  The provisions of this chapter are in addition to all other laws relating to legal investments and shall be controlling as the latest expression of the Legislature with respect thereto.



######### 30963.  
(a) The State of California pledges and agrees with the holders of the bonds issued pursuant to this chapter, and with those parties who may enter into contracts with the authority pursuant to this chapter, that the state will not limit, alter, or restrict the rights hereby vested in the authority to finance the toll bridge improvements authorized by this chapter, Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 30910), or Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 31000).  The State of California pledges and agrees not to impair the terms of any agreements made with the holders of bonds, and with the parties who may enter into contracts with the authority pursuant to this chapter, and pledges and agrees not to impair the rights or remedies of the holders of any revenue bonds or any parties until the bonds, together with interest, are fully paid and discharged and any contracts are fully performed on the part of the authority.

######### 31070.  
The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:

(a) Following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, legislation was enacted to make seismic safety a top transportation priority in this state.  In the wake of the Northridge earthquake of 1994, when nine major freeway bridges were destroyed and 11 major highways wee closed, seismic retrofit of the state’s bridges and highways again became the number one priority on the state’s transportation agenda.

(b) In 1996, voters approved Proposition 192, a two billion dollar ($2,000,000,000) bond measure for state highway seismic retrofit.  This funding measure includes the costs of retrofitting seven state-owned toll bridges, five in the San Francisco-Oakland Bay area and two in southern California.  Replacement costs for the eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge were factored in as well.

(c) Subsequent to the adoption of Proposition 192, new cost estimates by the department increase the toll bridge retrofit program from six hundred fifty million dollars ($650,000,000) to two billion six hundred million dollars ($2,600,000,000).  To address this increase, the Legislature enacted legislation in 1997, establishing the compromise of a 50/50 funding agreement between the state and local toll payers to finance all state-owned bridges in the San Francisco-Oakland Bay area, Los Angeles, and San Diego.

(d) It is the further intent of the Legislature that the department address the funding deficiency through a combination of financing options. These options may or may not include obtaining a loan under the federal Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-178), a program authorized by the Congress of the United States in 1998 to provided credit assistance for large transportation projects.

(e) Other financing options include revenue bonds and commercial paper should be issued under the authority of the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Financing Bank, the California Transportation Commission, or other, appropriate entity.

(c) “Bank” means the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank established under Section 63021 of the Government Code.

(d) “Bay area bridges” means the state-owned toll bridges in the region within the area of the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission.

(e) “Bonds” has the meaning defined in subdivision (e) of Section 63010 of the Government Code.

(f) “Department” means the Department of Transportation.

(g) “TIFIA” means the federal Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-178).

The bank may issue bonds for this purpose, pursuant to the authority granted to it under Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 63070) of Division 1 of Title 6.7 of the Government Code, and deposit the proceeds from the bonds into the account.  The amount of borrowing may be increased to fund necessary reserves, capitalized interest, interim bonds, including, but not limited to, commercial paper, costs of issuance, and administrative, financial, legal, and incidental services related to the bonds.  The department shall pursue the most cost-effective and efficient financing plan for the bridge work identified in paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 188.5.

(b) To the extent provided in the governing documents, each of the bonds issued under this section shall be payable from, and secured by, all or a portion of the toll surcharge revenue in the account and the assets in that account.

(c) Prior to the issuance of bonds payable from the toll surcharge, the bank shall confirm that bonds issued under Chapter 4.3 (commencing with Section 30950) shall not be impaired solely by action taken under this section, as evidenced by confirmation of the then existing ratings on these bonds, by the rating agencies then rating the bonds.  This requirement shall not apply if the voters approve an increase in the toll rate pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 30921.



######### 31071.3.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, during the construction period, all revenues generated from the toll surcharge shall be available to the department only for the construction and financing purposes of the toll bridge seismic retrofit program.



######### 31071.5.  
(a) Bonds issued under this chapter may not be deemed to constitute a debt or liability of the state or of any political subdivision thereof, other than the bank, or a pledge of the faith and credit of the state or of any political subdivision thereof, but shall be payable solely from the account, and the assets of the account, and the security provided by the account.  All bonds issued under this chapter shall contain on the face of the bonds a statement to this effect.

The purchase price of all bonds issued pursuant to this chapter shall be paid to the treasurer for the account of the authority.



######### 31151.

(d) Such other provisions for the protection of the holders of the bonds as the authority approves including, without limiting (a), (b), or (c), provisions that in the event of refusal or failure to comply with any provision of this chapter or any other applicable law, or of any agreement made with the holders of the bonds or of any issue thereof, the holders of a stated percentage in aggregate principal amount of the bonds, or of such issue thereof as the case may be, then outstanding may, in accordance with such appropriate procedure as is provided in the agreement or indenture, appoint a trustee to represent all the holders of the bonds, or all the holders of the issue thereof as the case may be, in the matter of exercising and prosecuting on their behalf such rights and remedies as are available to them under the law.  The authority shall in its absolute discretion fix the terms and conditions upon which the trustee or trustees shall receive, hold and disburse the revenues and may prescribe the powers and duties of the trustee or trustees.

######### 31157.  
The authority may contract loans and borrow money through the sale of bonds of the same character as those authorized pursuant to this chapter, from the United States or any of its departments, agencies, or instrumentalities upon such conditions and terms as may be agreed to. Such bonds shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter except the requirement that bonds be first offered at public sale pursuant to advertisement.



######### 31158.  
If a bond issue for the acquisition or construction of the toll tunnel is authorized and sold in whole or in part and the authority deems it advisable and advantageous to enlarge or extend the toll tunnel or to change the structure or design thereof in order to afford new or greater facilities for any type or class of traffic, the authority may issue additional bonds for the purpose of enlarging or extending the toll tunnel or changing the structure or design thereof in order to afford such new or greater facilities. Such additional bonds shall be issued only if the surrender and cancellation of all outstanding bonds issued for the acquisition or construction of the toll tunnel as originally designed can be assured or obtained by call or by consent of the holders thereof. Such additional bonds shall not constitute a debt or obligation of the state or of El Dorado County but shall be bonds of the authority of the same character and payable from the same funds as other bonds authorized pursuant to this chapter. The pledge of the tolls and other revenues to be received from the operation of the toll tunnel to the payment of outstanding bonds shall not be lessened, diminished, or affected in any way by the issuance of such additional bonds.

If the outstanding bonds issued for the acquisition or construction of the toll tunnel as originally designed are, at the time of issuance of the additional bonds, by their terms subject to immediate retirement before maturity at the option of the authority, or if the holders consent to the retirement of such bonds, the authority may include in the issue of bonds to be sold for the purpose of enlarging or extending the toll tunnel or changing the design thereof, an amount of bonds sufficient to produce funds with which to retire the outstanding bonds according to their terms. Before any such additional bonds are delivered the authority shall first duly call the outstanding bonds for redemption in accordance with their terms and conditions or obtain the consent of the holders thereof to their retirement.



######### 31160.  
Out of the proceeds derived from the sale of any such additional bonds there shall be set aside an amount of money sufficient to retire such outstanding bonds as may be thereafter presented for payment.

######### 31161.  
All provisions of this chapter apply with like force and effect to the issuance of any bonds of the new authorized issue, and the holders thereof are subrogated to all the rights and powers of the holders of the bonds which are surrendered in exchange therefor, except as such rights and powers are modified by the express terms of the bonds of the new authorized issue or the proceedings authorizing their issuance.



######### 31162.  
Whenever bonds of any kind have been issued and are outstanding pursuant to this chapter, the authority may from time to time or at one time issue and sell or exchange funding or refunding bonds for the purpose of retiring, paying, funding, or refunding either all or such part of the outstanding bonds or of one or more issues or series thereof, as it deems advisable. Such funding or refunding bonds shall be issued and delivered only when the issue or series of bonds to be funded or refunded have matured, are about to mature, are subject to retirement before maturity, or if the outstanding bonds are not subject to retirement, the retirement thereof has been assured or obtained by consent of the holders thereof.

Any and all reserve or other funds applicable to the payment of the bonds funded or refunded, may, if so directed by the authority, be transferred to any reserve or other funds provided with respect to the funding or refunding bonds. The pledge of the tolls and other revenues to be received from the operation of the toll tunnel to the payment of outstanding bonds shall not be lessened, diminished, or affected in any way by the issuance of such funding or refunding bonds.



######### 31164.  
Except as otherwise provided in this article, and except as modified by the express terms of the funding or refunding bonds or the proceedings authorizing their issuance, all the provisions of this chapter apply to such funding or refunding bonds and to the issuance and sale or exchange thereof, and the holders thereof shall be subrogated to all the rights and powers of the holders of the bonds funded or refunded thereby or surrendered in exchange therefor.

######### 31169.  
The bond redemption and interest payments constitute a first direct and exclusive charge and lien on all tolls and other revenues, and interest thereon, and sinking funds created therefrom received from the use and operation of the toll tunnel. Such tolls and revenues together with the interest earned thereon constitute a trust fund for the security and payment of the bonds and shall not be used or pledged for any other purpose as long as any such bonds are outstanding and unpaid.



######### 31170.  
While any bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of the authority shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of the bonds.



######### 31171.  
The holder of any bond may by mandamus or other appropriate proceeding compel the performance of any of the duties imposed upon the authority or its officers, agents, and employees in connection with the construction, maintenance, operation, and insurance of the toll tunnel, in connection with the collection, deposit, investment, application, and disbursement of all tolls and other revenues derived from the operation and use of the toll tunnel, and in connection with the deposit, investment, and disbursement of the proceeds received from the sale of bonds.

The Commissioner of Financial Institutions may investigate and ascertain the status or sufficiency as investments for savings banks in this state of any such bonds.  If upon investigation it is determined in his or her opinion that such bonds constitute a proper investment for savings banks, he or she shall so certify.

Any surplus which exists in the acquisition and construction fund shall be applied to the retirement, by purchase or call, of bonds issued for the acquisition or construction of the toll tunnel. If such bonds cannot be purchased at a price satisfactory to the authority and are not by their terms callable prior to maturity, the surplus shall be paid into the fund applicable to the payment of principal and interest of such bonds and shall be used for that purpose. The proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds may provide limitations and conditions upon the time and manner of applying the surplus to the purchase and call of outstanding bonds and the terms upon which they shall be purchased or called, and such limitations and conditions shall be followed and observed in the application and use of the surplus. All bonds retired by purchase or call shall be immediately canceled.

######### 31185.  
From the money deposited in the acquisition and construction fund, the treasurer shall transfer to the place or places of payment named in the bonds such sums as are required to pay the interest as it becomes due on all bonds sold and outstanding for the construction of the toll tunnel during the period of actual construction and during the period of six months immediately thereafter. The treasurer shall thereafter transfer from the toll revenue fund to the place or places of payment named in the bonds such sums as are required to pay the interest on the bonds and to redeem the principal thereof as such interest payments and bond redemptions fall due for all bonds issued and sold for the construction or acquisition of the toll tunnel. All funds transferred for the payment of principal or interest on bonds issued for the toll tunnel shall be segregated and applied solely for the payment of such principal and interest.



######### 31186.  
The money remaining in the toll revenue fund, after providing the amount required for interest and redemption of bonds, shall be held and applied as provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds.

######### 31187.  
Money required to meet the costs of acquisition or construction and all expenses and costs incidental to the acquisition or construction of the toll tunnel, or to meet the costs of operating, maintaining, and repairing it, shall be paid from the proper fund therefor upon demand of the authority.

##### ARTICLE 7. Insurance of Property [31220 - 31223]  

######### 31220.  
When the toll tunnel is being built by the authority, it may carry or cause to be carried such an amount of insurance or indemnity bond as protection against loss or damage as it deems proper.



######### 31221.  
The authority may carry insurance in such amount as it deems proper to cover any accident or destruction in part or in whole to the toll tunnel until all bonds sold for the acquisition or construction of such toll tunnel and interest accrued thereon have been fully redeemed and paid.



######### 31222.

######### 31223.  
The authority may also carry insurance or indemnity bonds insuring against the loss of tolls or other revenues to be derived from the toll tunnel by reason of any interruption in the use of the toll tunnel from any cause whatever.

######### 31300.  
(a) Tolls may be imposed by the commission on segments of newly constructed state highway routes, as described in subdivision (b), if transportation facilities, including, but not limited to, additional highways and capacity enhancing improvements to existing highways, are needed to accommodate additional commercial traffic resulting from the North American Free Trade Agreement, and federal funds have not been made available to the state for those purposes.  In addition, for state highway routes and transportation facilities constructed on or after January 1, 1997, the cost may be borne by a combination of tolls, toll-backed bonds, and any other state and federal funds that may be available for those purposes, on a project-by-project basis.

(b) The imposition of tolls pursuant to subdivision (a) is limited to Route 7, from the new international border crossing near Calexico to Route 8 near El Centro in Imperial County.

(c) Tolls imposed on any route described in this section shall be discontinued upon the happening of either of the following: (1) federal funds are received for the cost of the improvements to that route, which funds are in addition to the normal apportionment of federal funds to California and are for the specific purpose of mitigating the impacts of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or (2) the cost of those improvements is fully paid.



######### 31302.  
The department shall be responsible for the collection of tolls imposed by the commission pursuant to Section 31300.   The department shall transmit the toll revenues to the Controller for deposit in the Highway Toll Revenue Account, which is hereby created in the State Transportation Fund.

Notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, funds in the Highway Toll Revenue Account required to meet the obligations assumed by the commission under any bond resolution adopted pursuant to Section 31306 are continuously appropriated to the commission for that purpose.  Upon appropriation by the Legislature, the commission shall allocate the remaining funds to the department for the purpose of constructing additional highways or making capacity enhancing improvements to existing highways to accommodate additional commercial traffic resulting from the North American Free Trade Agreement.



######### 31306.  
The commission may issue revenue bonds for the purpose of obtaining funds for constructing additional highways or for making capacity enhancing improvements to existing highways to accommodate additional commercial traffic resulting from the North American Free Trade Agreement. The sole security for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds shall be revenues derived from the tolls imposed pursuant to Section 31300.  In authorizing and issuing bonds pursuant to this chapter, the commission and the department shall, to the fullest extent feasible, follow the procedures and requirements of Article 5 (commencing with Section 30200) of Chapter 1 of Division 17.







##### CHAPTER 7. Otay Mesa East Toll Facility Act [31460 - 31483]  

######### 31460.  
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) It is essential for the economic well-being of, and the maintenance of a high quality of life in, San Diego County and the State of California that the people of the State of California receive the full benefits of international trade with Mexico.

(b) Trade is a critical component of the San Diego regional economy. Mexico is the United States’ third largest trading partner, after Canada and China, and California’s number one export market.

(c) Trade passing through San Diego County’s portion of the United States-Mexico border region benefits every state in the union and contributes over $11 billion to the California GDP, and $26 billion to the United States GDP.

(d) Commercial and passenger traffic between the United States and Mexico using California’s ports of entry is placing extreme demands on the state’s border transportation assets which were not designed for these purposes.

(e) Congestion at the border causes increased wait times, which in turn increases commercial and noncommercial vehicle emissions.

(f) Inadequate infrastructure capacity at the existing border crossings between San Diego County and Baja California currently creates traffic congestion and delays for crossborder personal trips and freight movements that cost the United States and Mexican economies an estimated $3.4 billion in foregone gross output and more than 88,000 jobs in 2016.

(g) Public revenues to provide for an efficient border region transportation system have not kept pace with the growth of traffic and goods crossing the international border with Mexico.

(h) The state must seek all reasonable alternatives to address unmet border transportation needs and to improve existing transportation facilities.

(i) Public toll transportation facilities should be encouraged to supplement limited public resources and to support the development of new transportation system capacity.

(j) The port of entry serves, among other things, as a related fixed facility to the public system of streets and roads that facilitates the movement of goods, people, and services.

##### CHAPTER 2.1. Use of City Lands as Parking Places [31580 - 31582]  

######### 31580.  
As used in this chapter, “city lands” means lands owned by the city and which are either being used for the purpose of public offstreet parking or are not needed by the city for any other purpose and are available for such use.



######### 31581.  
The legislative body, at any time, may declare and agree that city lands shall be held, used, and treated in all respects the same as parking places acquired with the proceeds of collections of paid assessments and bonds issued pursuant to Section 31519. The city shall, in the resolution of intention, describe the city lands to be so held, used, and treated and shall state the amount of compensation, if any, to be paid the city therefor and the manner in which such compensation is to be paid.



######### 31582.  
The legislative body may increase, decrease, eliminate, change, or otherwise modify the lands to be so held, used, and treated, the improvements to be made or constructed thereon, or the compensation to be paid the city for such city lands, in the same manner and by the same procedure as is provided for increasing, decreasing, changing, or otherwise modifying the acquisitions and improvements to be made under this part.








##### CHAPTER 8. Board of Parking Place Commissioners [31770 - 31792]  

######### 31770.  
Immediately upon the acquisition of the parking places pursuant to the petition for the formation of the district, a parking place commission shall be appointed. In the discretion of the legislative body, the commission may be appointed at any time prior to such acquisition and after the adoption of the ordinance declaring the district formed.



######### 31770.1.  
At its discretion, the legislative body of any city may, by ordinance, provide for the appointment, removal, qualifications, terms of office and number of members of parking place commissioners for such city. Such board shall have all of the powers and duties of parking place commissioners appointed under this part. Such board, so appointed, may be an existing board created by city charter or ordinance or a new board created by ordinance. Such board may act for all vehicle parking districts established within the city under this part or for such of the districts as may be specified in the ordinance.



######### 31771.  
The commission may consist of three or five members.



######### 31772.  
Members of the commission shall serve without compensation.



######### 31773.  
In the case of a city, members of the commission shall be appointed by the mayor, subject to confirmation by the legislative body. In the case of a county they shall be appointed by the legislative body.



######### 31774.  
The commissioners shall hold office for the term of three years from the date of their appointment and qualification and until their successors are appointed and qualified, except that members of the first board appointed shall classify themselves by lot so that one member holds office for one year, one for two years, and one for three years, and, in each instance, until a successor has been appointed and qualified.



######### 31775.  
A commissioner may be removed by a four-fifths vote of the legislative body at any time.



######### 31776.  
Commissioners shall be persons of business experience and ability, to the end that the affairs of the district shall be administered in the interests of the district.



######### 31777.  
A commissioner may be an owner or lessee of property, or an officer, employee, or agent of a corporation owning or leasing property, within the district or, in the case of a commission appointed under Section 31865, within one of the districts, or any other qualified person.



######### 31778.  
Whenever a petition signed by the owners of more than one-half of the area of assessable land within the district requesting the removal of a commissioner is filed with the legislative body, it shall immediately remove him and appoint a new commissioner. The commissioner removed is ineligible to hold office as a commissioner of the district for one year following his removal. To secure the removal of a commissioner from a commission appointed under Section 31865, the petition shall be signed by the owners of more than one-half of the area of assessable land within each of a majority of the districts governed by the commission.



######### 31779.  
The board of commissioners shall have possession and complete charge, supervision and control of all parking places:

(a) Acquired, constructed, and paid for, or to be paid for, by taxes upon land or real property or assessments upon land in the district.

(b) Acquired or constructed for the use or benefit of the district and paid for in any other manner.



######### 31780.  
The board shall operate, manage, and control the parking places and make and enforce all necessary regulations for their use.



######### 31781.  
The board may fix, regulate, and collect rentals, fees, or charges for the parking of vehicles in parking places under its control, and may provide different rates for different classes of customers or users.



######### 31782.  
The providing of adequate public parking places in cities may require the use of assessment districts as authorized by Section 31519. Such districts will be created and will be successful only if so operated as to serve adequately the property within the district. It is the intent of this part that the owners of real property in an assessment district created pursuant to Section 31519 to provide parking places to solve the parking problems of the district may receive preferential rates, charges, or rentals for themselves, their tenants, and the classes of persons who call upon or do business with them, all to the end that the property which bears the burden and provides a solution for the parking problem shall receive a special benefit.



######### 31783.  
All parking places acquired and constructed pursuant to this part are public parking places, but the board of commissioners may restrict or partially restrict their use to owners and tenants of real property in the district, and classes of persons designated by such owners or their tenants, and may establish rates, charges, or rentals for the owners and tenants of such properties and classes of persons designated by the owners or tenants which differ from and are less than the rates, charges, or rentals charged other persons.



######### 31784.  
Rentals, fees, and charges shall be fixed after public hearing following such notice as the board of commissioners prescribes.



######### 31784.1.  
The board may, if it so desires, operate the parking places, or any thereof, as free public parking places without fee or charge.



######### 31785.  
The board shall appoint in the same manner as other city employees are selected, such employees as it deems necessary. The number of such employees and their salaries shall be determined by the legislative body unless, by ordinance, which may be adopted or repealed at any time, the power to make such determination is granted to the board. Any salary or wage so fixed shall in each instance be at least equal to the prevailing salary or wage for the same quality of services rendered to private persons, firms or corporations in the city under similar employment, in case such prevailing salary or wage can be ascertained.



######### 31786.  
In the exercise of its power to operate, manage, and control parking places, the board may lease any or all parking places to any person for the sole purpose of the operation of public parking facilities on them by such person, or may grant a franchise, or make a contract with any person for such purpose.



######### 31787.  
The consideration to be paid by the operator for any lease or franchise or under any contract may be a fixed sum or a percentage of gross rentals, fees, or charges collected by the operator, or any other consideration.



######### 31788.  
The maximum rentals, fees, and charges to be collected by the operator shall be fixed by the board after public hearing following such notice as the board prescribes, and shall be recited in the lease or franchise. No higher rentals, fees, or charges shall be collected by the operator without amendment of the lease or franchise agreed to by the board after like public hearing.



######### 31789.  
An operator shall not conduct any business other than that of the operation of public parking facilities on any parking place of the district.



######### 31790.  
Any lease or franchise may provide that the use of the parking places shall be restricted, or partially restricted, to owners and tenants of real property in the district, and classes of persons designated by them, and may provide for maximum rates, charges, or rentals for such persons which differ from and are less than the maximum rates, charges, or rentals charged other persons.



######### 31791.  
To expedite the conduct of proceedings and the making of any acquisition or improvement authorized by this part, the legislative body may, at any time prior to the appointment of a board of parking place commissioners, enter into a contract or lease with any owner or tenant of property in the proposed assessment district under which the owner or tenant, for a specified rental or other consideration and for a specified period not exceeding 20 years, reserves a reasonable proportion or number of parking spaces in a parking place of the district for the use of the owner or tenant of such property, the employees of the owner or tenant performing services on the property, and the customers of, or other classes of persons designated by, the owner or tenant and entering the property as invitees or otherwise. After the appointment of a board of parking place commissioners, the board may make such contracts or leases.



######### 31792.  
After the appointment of the board of parking place commissioners, any improvement of any parking place under its charge shall be made by the board.








##### CHAPTER 9. Taxation [31820 - 31830]  

######### 31820.  
Annually on or before June 30th, the board shall prepare an estimate of the expenditures required for the maintenance, operation, repair, and improvement of the parking places under its charge for the ensuing fiscal year, and required during that year for the acquisition of additional parking places, if any.



######### 31821.  
The board shall also estimate the amount of revenues to be derived from rentals, fees, or charges for the use of the parking places and the amount, if any, to be raised by taxation. The amount to be raised by taxation for the acquisition of additional parking places shall be stated separately.



######### 31822.  
The estimate shall be filed with the legislative body, and at the time and in the manner for levying general taxes, the legislative body shall levy and collect upon and against all of the taxable land and improvements within the district a special ad valorem tax sufficient to raise the sum of money estimated as required to be raised by taxation.



######### 31823.  
The tax levy for maintenance, operation, repair, and improvement of parking places in any year shall not exceed fifteen cents ($0.15) on each one hundred dollars ($100) assessed value of taxable land and improvements within the district. The tax levy for acquisition of additional parking places in any year shall not exceed twenty-five cents ($0.25) on each one hundred dollars ($100) assessed value of taxable land and improvements within the district.



######### 31824.  
The special tax shall be levied and collected at the same time, in the same manner, by the same officers, and with the same interest and penalties as general taxes levied by the legislative body.



######### 31825.  
The proceeds of the tax levied for maintenance, operation, repair, and improvement shall be placed in the district maintenance and operation fund and expended only for the maintenance, operation, repair, and improvement of parking places under the control of the board.



######### 31826.  
The proceeds of the tax levied for the acquisition of parking places shall be placed in a separate fund of the district and shall be expended only for the purpose for which it was levied.



######### 31827.  
All revenues from fees, charges, or rentals for the use of any parking place of the district shall be turned over to the treasurer and by him placed in such fund as the board designates, and may be used for the acquisition, improvement, maintenance, repair, and operation of any parking places for the use and benefit of the district.



######### 31828.  
If the board determines that the revenues from fees, charges, and rentals exceeds the amounts necessary for the proper maintenance, operation, repair and improvement of the parking places, and the acquisition of additional parking places, upon the order of the board the surplus revenue may be applied as a credit to each assessment in the proportion which the principal amount of each assessment bears to the total principal amount of all the assessments. The credit to each assessment, when added to all prior credits to that assessment, shall not exceed the principal amount of that assessment.



######### 31829.  
If the assessment has been paid in cash, the credit shall be returned in cash to the person who paid the corresponding assessment, upon his furnishing satisfactory evidence of such payment.



######### 31830.  
If the assessment is unpaid, the credit shall be applied upon the earliest unpaid installment or installments of principal and interest and any excess over the total principal and interest remaining unpaid shall be returned as provided in Section 31829.

Whenever the mayor, with the approval of the legislative body, has appointed the members of a parking authority, as provided by Section 32656, the legislative body, after receipt from the parking authority of a resolution adopted by a majority vote of the parking authority consenting thereto, may adopt a resolution declaring itself to be the parking authority, in which case all the rights, powers, duties, privileges, and immunities vested by this part in the members of the parking authority appointed under Section 32656 shall be vested in the legislative body as the parking authority.



######### 32661.3.  
A legislative body which has declared itself to be the parking authority pursuant to Sections 32661.1 or 32661.2 may, at any time, by resolution, determine that it shall no longer function as the parking authority, in which event the mayor, with the approval of the legislative body, shall appoint five electors of the city as members of the parking authority, as provided in Sections 32656 and 32657.

At the time the authority becomes authorized to transact business and exercise its powers, and from time to time thereafter, the legislative body, subject to its fiscal law, may make an estimate of the amount of money required for administrative purposes of the authority, and by a two-thirds vote, appropriate such amounts to the authority as it deems necessary, subject to such conditions as it prescribes.

##### CHAPTER 5. Revenue Bonds [33100 - 33148]  

######### 33100.  
As used in this chapter, “bonds” means revenue bonds issued pursuant to this part.



######### 33101.  
Bonds shall not be issued in any city until the legislative body, either at a general or a special election, submits to the electors of the city the question whether the city or the authority, or both, shall be authorized to adopt the revenue bond method of financing projects provided for in this part. If a majority of the voters voting upon the proposition favor the proposition, the authority, or the city, or both, as specified in the proposition, may from time to time issue bonds in accordance with this part. In any city in which the voters have previously authorized the issuance of general obligation bonds or revenue bonds for parking facilities an authority or the city, pursuant to Section 33552, may issue bonds without submitting such proposition to the voters.



######### 33101.5.  
In lieu of the submission of such question the legislative body may from time to time so submit to such electors the proposition of the issuance, by the authority or the city, pursuant to this part, of revenue bonds in a specific amount, to finance a specific project or specific projects. If at any such election a majority of the voters voting upon the proposition vote in favor thereof, the power to issue revenue bonds as provided in this part shall be operative as to the bonds so specified, and the authority, or the city, as may have been so specified, may from time to time issue revenue bonds in accordance with the provisions of this part in an amount or amounts not exceeding the amount so specified for the project or projects so specified.



######### 33101.6.  
Sections 33101 and 33101.5 shall not apply where the bonds are issued to finance a project which is to be leased to the city and where the principal of and interest on the bonds are to be payable from rentals paid by the city under such lease.



######### 33102.  
The authority shall have power to borrow money to provide funds for any project and to issue in its name revenue bonds to evidence the indebtedness created by such borrowing. The bonds of each issue shall constitute special obligations, and evidence a special indebtedness, of the authority, which shall be a charge upon, and payable, both as principal and interest, and as to any premiums upon the redemption of any thereof, solely from, such revenues and funds as are specified therein and in the proceedings for their issuance, and shall not constitute obligations, nor evidence any indebtedness, of the city, or of the State.



######### 33103.  
All such bonds shall recite upon their face, in substance, that the bonds of each issue shall constitute special obligations, and evidence a special indebtedness, of the authority, which shall be a charge upon, and payable, both as principal and interest, and as to any premiums upon the redemption of any thereof, solely from, such revenues and funds as are specified therein and in the proceedings for their issuance, and shall not constitute obligations, nor evidence any indebtedness, of the city, or of the State, and shall also recite upon their face that they are issued under this part, which for that purpose may be designated by the short title provided for in Section 32500.



######### 33104.  
An authority may issue such types of bonds as it determines, including bonds on which the principal and interest are payable:

(a) Exclusively from the income and revenue of the parking facilities financed with the proceeds of the bonds, or with such proceeds and financial assistance from the State or Federal Governments or from any other source in aid of such projects.

(b) Exclusively from the income and revenue of certain designated parking facilities, whether or not such facilities were financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of the bonds, and including income or revenue from any future extension, betterment, or addition to any such parking facilities thereafter to be established.

(c) From its revenues generally.

(d) From any contributions or other financial assistance from the city, the State or Federal Governments, or from any other source.

(e) From parking meter revenue of the city which may be appropriated by the governing body of the city.

(f) From any combination of these sources.



######### 33105.  
Bonds may be additionally secured by the pledging of, placing a charge upon, or otherwise making available any parking meter revenue. Until all bonds so secured have been paid, the legislative body of a city may allocate, pledge, place a charge upon, or otherwise make available its parking meter revenue or special taxes for periods of years for the financing or operation of any project authorized by this part and the payment of principal and interest on all or any type of bond issued and outstanding pursuant to this part.



######### 33105.5.  
Nothing in this part nor in the specification, in the proceedings for the issuance of any bonds, of the sources of payment thereof, shall preclude any of the following:

(a) The payment of interest on or principal of any such bonds out of sums received as premiums or accrued interest on the sale thereof.

(b) The payment of principal of or interest on, or premiums on the redemption of, any such bonds out of the proceeds of the sale of refunding bonds issued for that purpose.

(c) The payment of any interest on any such bonds accruing during, and for not to exceed two years after, the period of the construction of a project on account of which they were issued, or for any other reasonably limited period, out of the proceeds of the sale of such bonds.

(d) The payment of any principal of, interest on, or premiums on the redemption of, any such bonds by the purchasers thereof, or by any entity other than the authority issuing the same in any case where such purchasers or entity may have guaranteed such payment.

(e) The application to the payment of any principal of, interest on, or premiums on the redemption of, any such bonds of any funds which the authority may lawfully so apply.



######### 33106.  
Except as limited by express provision of this part, each authority, by resolution, or by contract, or other agreement with, or for the benefit of, the bondholders, may determine all the terms and conditions of each issue, series, or division of bonds and of their sale and issuance, and all matters necessary or appropriate in connection with the bonds.



######### 33107.  
An authority may provide for the aggregate principal amount, date or dates, maturities, interest rate or rates, interest payment dates, denominations and form of such bonds, and may provide for the issuance thereof as serial bonds or sinking fund bonds, as payable to bearer or to named payees, or as registered bonds, and for the issuance thereof with or without coupons, and for the subsequent registration of bonds, and for all other terms and conditions upon which they shall be executed, issued, secured, sold, paid, redeemed, funded, and refunded.



######### 33107.5.  
The authority may provide that any resolution or resolutions adopted in connection with the authorization of any bonds shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds, not subject to repeal, and not subject to any modification other than to the extent and in a manner provided in any such resolution.



######### 33108.  
Reference on the face of the bonds to any such resolution by the date of its adoption, or to any such contract or other agreement by the date of its execution, or the apparent date on the face thereof, is sufficient to incorporate all of the provisions of the contract or agreement into the body of the bonds and their appurtenant coupons. Each taker and subsequent holder of the bonds or coupons, whether the coupons are attached to or detached from the bonds, has recourse to all of the provisions of the indenture and is bound thereby.

The authority may provide for such covenants and agreements on the part of the authority as it deems necessary or advisable for the better security of any bonds.



######### 33110.

######### 33114.  
The authority may provide for the making of a covenant requiring the authority to pay and discharge from the funds available for that purpose all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies, or other charges which if unpaid may become a lien or charge upon all or any part of the revenue, any facilities or properties, revenues charged with the payment of any bonds in connection with which the covenant is made, or physical properties of the project which may impair the security of the bonds.



######### 33115.  
The authority may provide for the making of a covenant which limits, restricts, or prohibits the power of the authority to mortgage or otherwise encumber, sell, lease, or dispose of any or all facilities and properties, any revenues of which are charged with the payment of any bonds in connection with which the covenant is made, or to enter into any lease or agreement which might impair or impede the operation of such facilities or properties, or any part thereof, or might otherwise impair or impede the rights of bondholders with respect to such revenues.



######### 33116.  
The authority may provide for the making of a covenant requiring the authority to fix, prescribe and collect, with respect to any or all properties, any revenues of which are charged with the payment of any bonds in connection with which such covenant is made, fees, tolls, rentals or other charges in connection with the services and facilities furnished from any such properties operated by it, and to fix and collect rentals or other charges for any such properties leased by it to others for operation, sufficient, with such parking meter revenues or other funds as may have been made available for and charged with such payment, to pay the principal of and interest on such bonds as they become due and payable, together with all expenses of operation, maintenance and repair of such facilities and properties, and with such additional sums as may be required for any sinking fund, reserve fund or other special fund provided for the further security of such bonds or as a depreciation charge or other charge in connection with such facilities and properties, and all other charges payable out of any revenues charged with the payment of the bonds.

The authority may also provide for the making of a covenant requiring the fixing and prescribing by it and the collection by any lessee or operator of any or all facilities and properties, any revenues of which are charged with the payment of any bonds in connection with which such covenant is made, of all fees, tolls, rentals, or other charges in connection with the services and facilities furnished by such lessee or operator, sufficient to assure the payment by such lessee or operator to such authority of the rentals or other charges payable by such lessee or operator to such authority.

######### 33121.  
The authority may provide for the terms and conditions upon which any bonds may become or be declared due and payable prior to maturity, upon the happening of any specified event of default, and the terms and conditions upon which such declaration and its consequences may be waived.



######### 33122.  
The authority may provide for the rights, limitations, powers, and duties arising upon breach by the authority of any of the covenants, conditions, or obligations contained in any resolution, contract, or agreement.



######### 33123.  
The authority may provide for a procedure by which certain specified terms and conditions of any resolution, contract, or agreement may be subsequently amended or modified, or any provision thereof waived, with the consent of the authority and the vote or written assent of the holders of a specified principal amount of the bonds issued and outstanding. Such provision may authorize meetings of bondholders and specify the manner in which the consent of the bondholders may be given. Such provision shall specifically state the effect of such amendment, modification, or waiver upon the rights of the holders of all of the bonds and interest coupons appertaining to the bonds, whether attached to or detached from the bonds.



######### 33124.  
The provisions for such procedure may include an agreement that bonds held by the authority, the city, or by any other person or entity who or which the authority may determine to be so interested in the matter as to make it proper, shall not be counted as outstanding bonds, and that the holders thereof shall not be entitled to vote or assent with respect to such amendment, modification or waiver, but shall nevertheless be subject thereto.

The authority may provide for the issuance of bonds in series, and for the division of any issue into two or more divisions, and may fix different maturities or dates of such bonds, different rates of interest, or prescribe different terms and conditions for the bonds of the several series or divisions. After having authorized or issued bonds the authority may from time to time thereafter authorize and issue other bonds, subject to any covenants it may have made restricting the future issuance of bonds.



######### 33130.  
All bonds of the same authorized issue need not be of the same kind or character, have the same security, or bear the same interest rate, but the terms of the bonds shall in each case be prescribed by the authority.



######### 33133.  
Bonds may be callable upon such terms, conditions, and notice as the authority determines, and upon the payment of the premium, if any, fixed by the authority in the proceedings for their issuance.

The authority may provide for the issuance, sale, or exchange of refunding bonds to redeem or retire any revenue bonds issued by it. All provisions of this part applicable to the issuance of bonds are applicable to refunding bonds and to their issuance, sale or exchange. However, even if the alternative method provided for in Section 32655 of submitting to the electors the question of issuing bonds in a specific amount has been followed, without the submission of the question of adopting the revenue bond method of financing, no submission to the electors of the proposition of issuing refunding bonds shall be required as a prerequisite to the issuance of such refunding bonds; and if the proposition of adopting the revenue bond method of financing has been submitted and carried, it shall be full authority for the issuance of refunding bonds.

The formation of a parking district may be proposed by petition signed by the owners of real property in the proposed district, as shown by the last equalized assessment roll, owning real property of an assessed value of not less than fifty-one percent (51%) of the total assessed value of all taxable real property in the district, as shown by the assessment roll, and owning taxable land in the proposed district constituting not less than fifty-one percent (51%) of the total area of all taxable land in the district.



######### 35251.  
The petition shall contain:

(a) A general description of the boundaries of the proposed district.

(b) A general description of the parking places proposed to be acquired.

(c) A general description of any public ways proposed to be acquired for ingress to or egress from the parking places.

(d) A general statement of the improvements to be made or constructed on the proposed parking places, the public ways proposed to be acquired, or existing public ways which would provide ingress to or egress from the proposed parking places.

(e) Any limits as to time and rate upon ad valorem assessments which may be levied upon taxable real property in the district for the purposes permitted by this part.  The limits as to time shall not exceed 36 years from the date of the bonds, and the limits as to rate shall not exceed seventy-five cents ($0.75) on each one hundred dollars ($100) of assessed valuation.

This limit as to rate does not apply to any district in a chartered city. The petition shall contain the maximum tax rate which will be levied in any parking district in a chartered city.

(f) Any amount of money which it is proposed that the city contribute toward the cost and expense of the acquisitions and improvements proposed by the petition, toward the payment of incidental expenses of the proceedings hereunder, for the establishment of a reserve fund for the payment of the bonds and the interest thereon, or for other purposes in connection with the district.

(g) A general statement of the public ways within the district on which it is proposed the city install and maintain, or continue to maintain, parking meters, the net revenues from which will be allocated and pledged to any of the purposes specified in this part, and the period of time, measured from the date of the bonds, for which it is proposed that the city agree to maintain the meters.  If it is proposed that only a specified amount, percentage, or portion of the net revenues shall be so allocated and pledged, the amount, percentage or portion shall be generally defined.



######### 35252.  
The petition shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the legislative body.



######### 35253.  
When the petition is filed, the clerk of the legislative body shall examine the petition. If it is signed by the requisite number of qualified signers, the clerk shall so certify to the legislative body.



######### 35253.1.  
If the petition is not signed by the requisite number of qualified signers, the clerk shall certify to the legislative body that said petition is insufficient. If the petition is insufficient, supplemental petitions may be filed within three months from the date of the certificate of insufficiency, or such additional period as the legislative body may allow, not to exceed six months from the date of the first certificate of insufficiency.



######### 35253.2.  
The clerk shall certify the sufficiency of the petition and any supplemental petitions to the legislative body, if the petition, together with supplemental petitions if any, shall be signed by the requisite number of signers as shown by the last equalized assessment roll upon the date of said certificate. Such certification shall be conclusive as to the sufficiency of the petition.



######### 35253.3.  
If any person shown on the last equalized assessment roll to be the owner of land within the proposed district shall be unable to sign by reason of legal disability or shall cease to be the owner of all or any part of such land before the petition or supplemental petition shall have been filed with the clerk, said petition or supplemental petition may be signed by the legal representative (as hereinafter designated) or other successor in interest of said owner. All petitions signed by a person other than said owner shall be accompanied by written evidence, satisfactory to the clerk, that the signer

(a) In the case of a legal representative, is the duly appointed guardian, executor or administrator of the estate of said owner, or

(b) In the case of other successors in interest, is the holder of legal title to, or has the beneficial ownership in, said land.

If the assessed value of any parcel of land, and any improvements thereon, is not shown or separately shown upon the assessment roll, upon request of the clerk, the assessor shall estimate the assessed value of such parcel and any improvements thereon, and such estimate for the purpose of certifying said petition shall be considered the assessed value of such parcel, and any improvements thereon.



######### 35254.  
If the petition proposes a contribution of money by the city, the legislative body either shall reject the petition, or prior to the adoption of the resolution of intention, shall agree to make a contribution not less than the amount specified in the petition.



######### 35255.  
The statement of the amount of city contribution in the petition or in the resolution of intention shall not prevent the city from making additional contributions to the project before or after the issuance of bonds therefor and shall not prevent the city from paying all or any part of the incidental expenses in connection with the proceedings under this part.



######### 35256.  
If the petition proposes that the city install and maintain, or continue to maintain, parking meters on public ways within the district, the legislative body either shall reject the petition, or prior to the adoption of the resolution of intention, shall agree to install and maintain, or continue to maintain, parking meters as proposed in the petition. The legislative body shall not so agree unless it finds and determines that the public interest, convenience, and necessity require that the meters be installed and maintained, or be continued to be maintained, as proposed in the petition.



######### 35257.  
The legislative body shall either approve the petition or reject it. If it approves the petition, it shall direct the city engineer or other competent person to make and file with it a report showing the following:

(a) An estimate of the cost of the acquisitions and improvements proposed by the petition and of the incidental expenses in connection therewith and of the proceedings therefor.

(b) An estimate of the annual revenues which can be expected to be derived from the operation of the proposed parking places, and of the annual expenses of operating and maintaining the parking places exclusive of principal and interest on the bonds to be issued.

(e) The amount to be contributed by the city as proposed by the petition and agreed to by the legislative body.

(f) An estimate of the amount of the bonds proposed to be issued, the maximum number of years the bonds are to run, and the maximum rate of interest to be payable thereon not in excess of 7 percent a year.

(h) A general statement of the public ways within the district on which the city, as proposed by the petition, will install and maintain, or continue to maintain parking meters, the net revenues from which will be allocated and pledged to any of the purposes specified in this part, and the period of time, measured from the date of the bonds, for which the city will agree to maintain the meters.  If it is proposed that only a portion of the net revenues be so allocated and pledged, that portion shall be generally defined.

(i) The time and place for two hearings on the proposed formation of the district and the time within which and the place where protests may be filed.

(j) The resolution shall make reference to the report on file in the office of the clerk.

######### 35261.  
Any error, failure, or mistake in the mailing of the copy of resolution or any thereof and any failure of any person to receive the copy shall not affect in any way the validity of any proceedings hereunder.



######### 35262.  
Any person interested and objecting to the formation of the parking district, the extent thereof, the inclusion of his property therein, the proposed acquisitions and improvements, the issuance of bonds, or to any other proposal in the resolution of intention, may file a written protest with the clerk of the legislative body at any time prior to the time fixed for the hearing.



######### 35263.  
At the hearing the legislative body shall hear and determine all protests filed.



######### 35264.  
The legislative body’s decision on the protests shall be final and conclusive. However, if the owners of taxable real property in the district having an assessed valuation of more than one-half of the assessed valuation of all taxable real property in the district at the conclusion of the hearing have on file and not withdrawn their written protests objecting to the formation of the district, the legislative body shall find that a majority protest has been filed, and the proceeding shall be terminated. No further proceedings shall be had or taken pursuant to the petition.



######### 35265.  
Any protest filed may be abandoned and withdrawn by written notice of such abandonment or withdrawal signed by the person who signed the protest and filed with the clerk of the legislative body at any time prior to the conclusion of the hearing.



######### 35266.  
If a proceeding is terminated by the filing of a majority protest a new petition for the same purpose may not be filed until the expiration of one year from the date of the finding that a majority protest was filed. However, a new petition for a modified project may be filed at any time.



######### 35267.  
The hearing may be continued from time to time at the discretion of the legislative body.



######### 35268.  
At the hearing the legislative body may alter the boundaries of the proposed district as it finds to be proper and advisable and shall define and establish the boundaries, but the legislative body shall not modify the boundaries so as to include any territory which will not in its judgment be benefited by the proposed project, and no territory shall be excluded from the proposed district which will in the judgment of the legislative body be benefited by the proposed project.



######### 35269.  
At the hearing the legislative body may increase, decrease, change, or otherwise modify the acquisitions or improvements to be made, but the legislative body shall not do so, without first procuring from the city engineer or other competent person a supplemental report showing the effect thereof upon the estimates and other data given in the original report.



######### 35269.5.  
If the legislative body proposes to make changes in the boundaries of the proposed district or in the acquisitions and improvements, it shall take the proceedings required by Sections 35270 to 35273, inclusive, and shall continue the hearing to the time fixed for hearing objections to the proposed changes.



######### 35270.  
The legislative body shall not change any boundaries or acquisitions and improvements, except after notice of intention to do so is published pursuant to Section 6066 of the Government Code in the newspaper in which the resolution of intention was published. The notice shall specify a time for hearing objections to the proposed change, which shall be not less than twenty (20) days after the first publication of the notice. If a change proposed is to include additional real property in the district, the clerk of the legislative body shall also mail a copy of the notice, postage prepaid, to each person to whom real property in the area proposed to be added is assessed as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, at his address as shown upon the roll, and to each person, whether owner in fee or having a lien upon, or legal or equitable interest in, any such real property, whose name and address and a designation of the real property in which he is interested is on file in the office of the clerk. The notice shall be mailed at least 20 days prior to the time set for hearing objections.

######### 35272.  
The legislative body shall hear and pass upon objections to proposed changes at the time appointed or at any time to which the hearing may be adjourned. Its decision shall be final.



######### 35272.5.  
If the boundaries are changed, protests objecting to the formation of the district made by owners of real property excluded by the change shall not be counted in computing a majority protest as hereinbefore provided, but written protests objecting to the formation of the district made by owners of real property remaining in the district and by the owners of real property added by the change and filed not later than the time fixed for hearing objections to such change shall be counted in computing a majority protest as hereinbefore provided.



######### 35273.  
At the conclusion of the hearing fixed by the resolution of intention, if no majority protest is on file and if all protests and objections, including protests and objections to changes, have been overruled and denied, the legislative body may proceed further under this part, and may adopt an ordinance declaring that the parking district is formed and describing the acquisitions and improvements to be made.



######### 35273.1.  
The legislative body shall not pass any ordinance forming a district under this part until it shall have procured such information as it deems necessary and adequate to enable it to determine whether there is public need for such facilities, whether the proposed district approximately covers the contiguous area needing such facilities, whether sufficient property within the proposed district will be benefited thereby, and whether the proposed improvements are located and designed in the manner most compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury.



######### 35274.  
Any district formed pursuant to this part may be named “Parking District No. ____ of the City of ____.”



######### 35275.  
Any objections or protests not made at the time and in the manner provided in this chapter are deemed waived voluntarily. Proceedings under this chapter shall not be attacked after the conclusion of the hearing upon any ground not stated in an objection or protest filed pursuant to this chapter.



######### 35276.  
No action, proceeding or defense to correct, set aside, cancel, avoid, annul or otherwise attack any proceedings under this part up to and including the adoption of the ordinance declaring the district formed shall be maintained by any person unless such action, proceeding or defense is commenced or made within 30 days after the adoption of such ordinance. No action, proceeding or defense to correct, set aside, cancel, avoid, annul or otherwise attack any proceedings under this part taken subsequent to the adoption of said ordinance, including but not limited to proceedings taken and determinations made pursuant to Sections 35402 and 35402.3, shall be maintained by any person unless such action, proceeding or defense is commenced or made within 30 days after the taking of such proceedings.








##### CHAPTER 2.1. Use of City Lands as Parking Places [35300 - 35305]  

######### 35300.  
As used in this chapter, the term “city lands” means lands already owned by the city which are located within the boundaries of an existing or proposed district and which are either being used for the purpose of public off-street parking or are not needed by the city for any other purpose and are available for such use.



######### 35301.  
The legislative body, at any time after the filing of a petition for the formation of such district, may by ordinance declare and agree that city lands shall for all purposes of said district be held, used and treated in all respects the same as parking places acquired with the proceeds of bonds issued under this part. Such ordinance shall not become effective until said district shall have been formed and bonds shall have been issued for such district, as provided in this part. If such ordinance is adopted and becomes effective, such city lands shall be so held, used and treated and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the revenues from the operation of off-street parking facilities thereon may be pledged and used for the same purposes as those for which revenues from parking facilities acquired or improved with proceeds of such bonds may be pledged and used. The ordinance shall describe the city lands to be so held, used and treated and shall state the amount of compensation, if any, to be paid the city therefor and the manner in which said compensation is to be paid.



######### 35302.  
The petition for the formation of the district under this part may propose that the legislative body shall adopt such an ordinance with respect to any city lands, and may propose improvements to be made or constructed thereon and shall state the amount of compensation, if any, to be paid to the city therefor and the manner in which compensation is to be paid. In the event that the petition proposes that the legislative body adopt such an ordinance with respect to any such city lands, the legislative body either shall reject the petition or, prior to the adoption of the resolution of intention, shall adopt with respect to such city lands the ordinance authorized by this section for the compensation, if any, provided in the petition. Failure of the petition to propose such an ordinance, or to propose such improvements, shall not prevent the legislative body from adopting such an ordinance at any time after the petition shall have been filed. If such ordinance is adopted prior to the adoption of the resolution of intention, whether said ordinance is in response to a proposal made in the petition or otherwise, the resolution of intention, in addition to the other matters required by the part, shall refer to the ordinance, shall contain a general description of such city lands and a general description of the improvements, if any, proposed to be made or constructed thereon, and shall state the amount and manner of payment of any compensation provided for in said ordinance.



######### 35303.  
If such ordinance is adopted after the hearing on the resolution of intention, said ordinance shall be adopted in the manner provided in this section. If no compensation is to be paid to the city for such city lands, the legislative body at any time, without further notice and hearing, may adopt such an ordinance. If a proposed ordinance provides for compensation to be paid to the city for such city lands, before adopting such proposed ordinance the legislative body shall adopt a resolution proposing the adoption of said ordinance. Said resolution shall describe the city lands to be covered by the proposed ordinance, shall specify the amount and manner of payment of the compensation to be paid the city, and shall fix a time and place for hearing objections to the adoption of said proposed ordinance. The resolution shall be published twice in a newspaper of general circulation printed and published in the city. The first publication shall be at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of the hearing. In cities where no such newspaper is published, the resolution shall be posted in three public places in the proposed district at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of hearing. At said hearing the legislative body shall hear and pass upon all objections and protests against the adoption of the proposed ordinance, and the decisions of the legislative body thereon shall be final and conclusive. If all protests and objections have been overruled and denied, the legislative body may adopt said ordinance.



######### 35304.  
Compensation to be paid the city for said city lands shall be paid only from contributions which may be made to the city for that purpose or from revenues theretofore or thereafter derived from said city lands or other lands acquired for the district as parking places. The right of the city to compensation from said revenues may be made subordinate to the rights of the holders of any bonds thereafter to be issued by the city under this part for the district; provided, however, that if at the time of adoption of the ordinance there are outstanding bonds issued by the city under this part for the district, the right of the city to compensation from said revenues shall be subordinate to any rights of the holders of such bonds to such revenues.



######### 35305.  
Whenever an ordinance is adopted pursuant to this section, whether in response to a proposal made in the petition or otherwise, the legislative body may, at the hearing on the resolution of intention or subsequent thereto, increase, decrease, eliminate, change or otherwise modify the lands to be so held, used and treated, the improvements to be made or constructed thereon, or the compensation to be paid the city for said city lands, in the same manner and by the same procedure as provided in this part for increasing, decreasing, changing or otherwise modifying the acquisitions and improvements to be made, and in that event the legislative body shall adopt a new ordinance pursuant to this chapter consistent with such changes and repealing the prior ordinance or shall amend the prior ordinance. No such increase, decrease, elimination, change or other modification shall be made in violation of the provisions of any ordinance, resolution or indenture providing for bonds already issued.








##### CHAPTER 3. Bonds, Acquisitions and Improvements [35402 - 35432]  

######### 35402.  
The legislative body may by ordinance, resolution, or indenture provide for the issuance of bonds of the district in an amount not exceeding the amount estimated to be necessary to make the proposed acquisitions and improvements, to pay the incidental expenses in connection therewith and the proceedings therefor and to establish a reserve fund for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds, and for working capital and interest during the period of construction and for a period of not to exceed six (6) months thereafter, less any amount to be contributed by the city for such purposes.



######### 35402.2.  
If at any time the legislative body finds that the proceeds of the bonds first issued will be insufficient to make all of the acquisitions and improvements described in the ordinance declaring the district formed and to pay the additional items specified in Section 35402, it may at one time or from time to time issue additional bonds to the extent permitted by the provisions, conditions and covenants contained in the ordinances, resolutions or indentures providing for the issuance of any bonds previously issued.



######### 35402.3.  
If at any time, either before or after issuing bonds, the legislative body so determines, it may at one time or from time to time add to, eliminate, change or otherwise modify any of the proposed acquisitions and improvements after notice and hearing in the same manner as provided in Sections 35270 to 35272, inclusive, but no such addition, elimination, change or modification shall be made unless following such hearing the legislative body shall determine that all of the territory within the district as originally formed or as changed pursuant to Section 35402.4, as the case may be, will be benefited by the acquisitions and improvements remaining after such addition, elimination, change or modification. Any such addition, elimination, change or modification shall be effected by an ordinance amending the ordinance declaring the district formed and describing the acquisitions and improvements to be made. No such addition, elimination, change or modification shall be made in violation of the provisions of any ordinance, resolution or indenture providing for bonds already issued.



######### 35402.4.  
At any time prior to the issuance of bonds, the legislative body may change the boundaries of the district after notice and hearing in the same manner as provided in Sections 35270 to 35272, but no such change shall be made unless following such hearing the legislative body shall determine that all of the territory within the district as changed will be benefited by the acquisitions and improvements originally ordered or the acquisitions and improvements as changed pursuant to Section 35402.3, as the case may be. Any such change in boundaries shall be effected by an ordinance amending the ordinance declaring the district formed. Proceedings under this section may be combined with proceedings under Section 35402.3.



######### 35403.  
The legislative body shall describe the form of bonds and of the interest coupons to be attached thereto.



######### 35404.  
The bonds shall all mature within 35 years after the date thereof and shall be payable at the times and at the place to be fixed by the legislative body and designated in the bonds.



######### 35405.  
The legislative body may make all or any portion of the bonds callable for redemption before maturity at such time, price, and other conditions as it determines. Any bond callable before maturity shall contain a recital to that effect.



######### 35406.  
The bonds shall be issued in such denomination or denominations as the legislative body may prescribe and payable on the day fixed in the bonds, with interest at the rate specified in the bonds. The interest rate shall not be in excess of the maximum stated in the resolution of intention and shall be paid semiannually, except the first interest coupon may be for a different period.



######### 35407.  
The bonds shall be signed by the mayor of the city or by such other officer as the legislative body in the ordinance, resolution or indenture authorizes and designates for that purpose and by the treasurer, and countersigned by the clerk.



######### 35408.  
The interest coupons on the bonds shall be numbered consecutively and signed by the treasurer.



######### 35409.  
All of the signatures on the bonds and interest coupons may be made by printed, lithographed, or engraved facsimile except the countersignature of the clerk, which shall be manually affixed.



######### 35410.  
If any officer whose signature or countersignature appears on the bonds or coupons ceases to be such officer before the delivery of the bonds to the purchaser, his signature or countersignature shall nevertheless be valid for all purposes, the same as if he had remained in office until the delivery of the bonds.



######### 35411.  
The bonds shall state in substance that:

(a) The bond and interest are payable solely from:

(1) The gross or net, as the case may be, revenues from the operation of the parking place or places acquired and improved with the proceeds, if such is the case.

(2) The net revenues, or a portion thereof, from parking meters on certain public ways within the district, if such is the case.

(b) Neither the city nor any of its officers is to be held otherwise liable for its principal or interest.



######### 35412.  
The ordinance, resolution, or indenture providing for the issuance of the bonds may also provide for the maintenance and operation of the parking facilities, for the fixing and collecting of rentals, fees and charges for the use of parking facilities, for the establishment of a special fund into which all revenues derived from the operation of the parking facilities shall be placed, for the use of moneys in this fund for payment of the expenses of operating and maintaining the parking places, for the payment of the bonds and the interest thereon, or for the establishment and maintenance of any reserve funds, sinking funds or other funds designed for securing or paying the bonds and the interest thereon.

######### 35414.  
The ordinance, resolution, or indenture providing for the issuance of the bonds may also provide for the levy each year, if so provided in the petition and in the resolution of intention, of an ad valorem assessment on all taxable real property in the district, to the extent to which revenues from the parking lots and from parking meters pledged to the payment of principal and interest of the bonds have been or are expected to be insufficient in any year to pay the principal and interest or to the extent to which any reserve fund established for said bonds has been or will be used to pay such interest and principal. The rate of ad valorem assessment shall be fixed by the legislative body each year in accordance with the provision. The ad valorem assessment shall not exceed the limits stated in the resolution of intention. The assessment shall be levied, collected, and enforced in the same manner, at the same times, and with the same penalties and interest, as in the case of taxes levied for the city.

######### 35415.5.  
The ordinance, resolution or indenture providing for the issuance of the bonds may also provide for restrictions on the operation by the city or the district of other facilities for the public parking of motor vehicles which would compete with the facilities, the revenues of which are pledged to the payment of the bonds and the interest thereon.



######### 35416.  
The ordinance, resolution, or indenture may also contain any other provisions, not inconsistent with this part, which are necessary or desirable to carry out its intent and purpose.



######### 35417.  
The provisions of the ordinance, resolution, or indenture shall constitute covenants for the benefit and protection of the holders of the bonds, and any holder may enforce the covenants by mandamus or other appropriate remedy.



######### 35418.  
Any provision of the ordinance, resolution, or indenture, except a provision as to the amount or time of payment of principal or interest on the bonds, may be later eliminated or modified by the legislative body, if the holders of not less than sixty percent (60%) of the outstanding bonds have agreed in writing to the elimination or modification.



######### 35419.  
The legislative body may sell the bonds at a price below the par or face value, provided that the discount on any bonds so sold shall not exceed 8 percent of the par value thereof.



######### 35420.  
Before selling all or any part of the bonds, the legislative body shall give notice inviting sealed bids in such mannner as it prescribes.



######### 35421.  
If satisfactory bids are received, the bonds offered for sale shall be awarded to the highest responsible bidder.



######### 35422.  
If no bids are received, or if the legislative body determines that the bids received are not satisfactory as to price or responsibility of the bidders, it may reject all bids received, if any, and either readvertise or sell the bonds at private sale.



######### 35423.  
The proceeds of the sale of the bonds shall be placed in the city treasury to the credit of the proper district fund and applied exclusively to the objects and purposes for which the same were issued.



######### 35424.  
The proceeds may be used to pay the interest on the bonds during the period of construction of any parking place and for a period of six months thereafter, except that the total period during which interest is paid from the proceeds shall not exceed three years from the date of the bonds.



######### 35425.  
The bonds and the interest coupons thereof shall be negotiable instruments.



######### 35426.  
With the proceeds from the sale of the bonds and with any money which the city has agreed to contribute for the purpose, the city by and through its proper officers shall make the acquisitions and improvements finally determined upon.



######### 35427.  
All contracts for the construction of any improvements shall be let and entered into as other contracts are let and entered into by the city.



######### 35428.  
When the acquisitions and improvements have been accomplished, any unexpended bond proceeds shall be placed in any fund for the payment or securing of the principal and interest of the bonds, or may be used to pay the cost of additional acquisitions or improvements for the district, and expenses incidental thereto, pursuant to change and modification proceedings.



######### 35429.  
After the bonds and all interest thereon have been fully paid, or prior thereto to the extent permitted by express provision of the ordinance, resolution, or indenture providing for the issuance of the bonds, all revenues derived from the operation of the parking facilities and not required for the operation and maintenance of the facilities may be used for the further improvement of the facilities for the benefit of the district, as the parking place commission of the district may decide. Any excess revenues shall be paid into the general fund of the city or the fees and charges reduced so that there will be no excessive revenue.



######### 35430.  
Whenever a district has been formed under this part and a bonded indebtedness has been incurred for public parking facilities as provided in this part, proceedings may later be taken hereunder for the further acquisition or improvement of public parking facilities for the district and the issuance of bonds therefor as provided in this part. Any such proceedings may be initiated by the filing with the clerk of the legislative body of either a petition by the owners of real property in the district or a certified copy of a resolution adopted by the parking place commission. Any such petition or resolution shall request such proceedings and, with respect to the proposed proceedings, additional acquisitions, improvements and bonds therein requested, may contain any matters authorized and shall contain any matters required in an original petition, except that it shall not be necessary to describe the boundaries of the district. The petition shall be signed, filed and certified in the same manner provided in this part for an original petition. Thereafter the procedure specified in this part for the formation of the district and the issuance of the initial bonds shall be followed so far as applicable; provided, however, that at the hearing the legislative body shall have no power to change the boundaries of the district and the acquisitions and improvements finally ordered to be made must be ones which the legislative body, following the hearing, finds to be of benefit to the district as originally formed.



######### 35431.  
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 35429, the bonds issued under Section 35430 to provide additional public parking facilities for the district may in part be secured by revenues from facilities acquired with the proceeds of bonds previously issued, to the extent that the allocation and pledge of such revenues to payment of the additional bonds is not prohibited by the ordinance, resolution or indenture providing for the bonds previously issued. The revenues from such additional facilities may be used to pay principal and interest on bonds previously issued to the extent authorized by the ordinance, resolution or indenture providing for the issuance of the bonds issued for such additional facilities.



######### 35432.  
The bonds issued under Section 35430 to provide additional public parking facilities for the district may in part be secured by those net revenues from parking meters on public ways within the district which were allocated and pledged to the payment of bonds previously issued to the extent the allocation and pledge of such revenues to the payment of the additional bonds is not prohibited by the ordinance, resolution or indenture providing for the bonds previously issued.







#### CHAPTER 3.5. Assessments and Bonds for Assessments [35450 - 35549.1]  


##### ARTICLE 1. General Provisions [35450- 35450.]  

######### 35450.  
Unless otherwise provided, the definitions contained in Part 1 (commencing with Section 5000) of Division 7 (the Improvement Act of 1911), govern the construction of this chapter, unless from the context of this chapter it clearly appears that a different meaning is intended.









##### ARTICLE 2. Assessments [35460 - 35483]  

######### 35460.  
If the legislative body on behalf of a district formed under this part has previously issued bonds pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 35400) of this part which are payable primarily from revenues from parking places or revenues from parking meters on streets, or both, and if the legislative body determines that it would be in the best interests of the district to be relieved of the obligation to continue to produce such revenues, the legislative body may by resolution declare its intention to take proceedings under this chapter for the levy of an assessment to provide the funds necessary for the redemption of the outstanding bonds. In such resolution the legislative body shall determine the maximum interest rate on and term of the bonds to be issued to represent unpaid assessments.



######### 35461.  
In the resolution, the legislative body shall order the engineer to make and deliver a diagram of the parking places for which the outstanding bonds were issued and of the property within the district.



######### 35462.  
The diagram shall show:

(a) The parking places for which the outstanding bonds were issued.

(b) Each separate lot or parcel of land within the district.

(c) The dimensions of each such lot or parcel of land and its relative location to the parking places for which the outstanding bonds were issued.



######### 35463.  
The diagram shall be delivered to the street superintendent who shall endorse the date of such delivery on the diagram.



######### 35464.  
Upon receiving the diagram, the street superintendent shall assess the total amount necessary for the redemption of the outstanding bonds against the land within the district subject to assessment, and all incidental costs and expenses in connection therewith, including, but not limited to, engineer and attorney fees, costs in connection with preparation of the diagram, and all other costs necessarily incurred or to be incurred as a result of proceeding under this chapter. The assessment shall be in proportion to the benefits derived from the parking place for which such bonds were issued. The total amount necessary for the redemption of the outstanding bonds shall include the principal thereof, the interest thereon to maturity or to the first available call date, and the premiums which must be paid to call the bonds.



######### 35465.  
All land within the district shall be assessed to provide the funds necessary for the redemption of the outstanding bonds, except:

(a) Land owned by the United States.

(b) Streets, alleys, and highways.

(c) Property acquired for parking places pursuant to this part.

(d) Public property exempt from assessment pursuant to Section 35466.



######### 35466.  
A lot or parcel of land in a public use belonging to the state or to a county, city, district, or other public corporation, public agent, mandatory of the government, school board, educational, penal or reform institution, or facility for the housing of persons with developmental or intellectual disabilities or mental health disorders in use in the performance of a public function and lying within the district is not subject to assessment unless the consent of its governing body to the assessment is filed with the legislative body at or prior to the confirmation of the assessment. If that consent is filed, the land is subject to assessment in the same manner as other land within the district.



######### 35467.  
An assessment upon public property is an enforceable obligation against the owner or the governing body controlling the property and shall be paid by the officer or board having charge of the disbursement of its funds.



######### 35468.  
If no money is available for the payment of an assessment of public property, the board or officer whose duty it is to levy taxes for the owner of the public property shall include in the next tax levy an amount, in addition to money for all other purposes, sufficient to pay the assessment and the interest thereon from the date the assessment is recorded, at the rate established for the bonds. When the money received from the tax levy is available, the assessment and interest shall be paid by the officer or board having charge of the disbursement of the funds of the owner.

Any duty imposed by this section and Section 35467 may be enforced by action, mandamus, or other proceeding.



######### 35469.  
The assessment shall be made, notice given, hearing held, and the assessment confirmed and recorded substantially in the manner provided in Chapter 16 (commencing with Section 5360) of Part 3 of Division 7 (the Improvement Act of 1911), and the provisions of that chapter relating to the method of making or spreading the assessment, the giving of notice, the making and waiving of objections, appeals or protests, the holding of the hearing, the finality and conclusiveness of the decisions and determinations of the legislative body, and the confirmation and recordation of the assessment are adopted as the procedure to be followed pursuant to this chapter. Except as provided by this chapter, all of the powers and authority granted in Chapter 16 (commencing with Section 5360) of Part 3 of Division 7 (the Improvement Act of 1911) are applicable to any assessment to be levied pursuant to this chapter.



######### 35469.5.  
The notice published pursuant to Section 5362 and the notices mailed pursuant to Section 5363 shall also contain a statement that the legislative body has declared its intention to take proceedings under this chapter for the levy of an assessment to provide funds necessary for the redemption of the outstanding bonds and shall state the maximum interest rate on and term of bonds to be issued to represent unpaid assessments. The notice shall also state that any person who has any objection to such proceedings for the levy of such assessment may file a written protest not later than the hour set for the hearing as stated in said notice.



######### 35469.6.  
At the hearing and prior to consideration of the correctness of the assessment and diagram, the legislative body shall hear and consider all protests to the proceedings for the levy of that assessment.  The notice, hearing, and protest procedures shall comply with Section 53753 of the Government Code.

The Special Assessment Investigation, Limitation and Majority Protest Act of 1931 (commencing with Section 2800) shall not apply to proceedings under this chapter.



######### 35469.7.  
If there is no such majority protest and if all protests to the proceedings are overruled, the legislative body may proceed with the hearing on the correctness of the assessment and diagram and may confirm the assessment.



######### 35469.8.  
The legislative body may not confirm the assessment unless the owners of a majority in area of the lands in the district subject to assessment have filed with the clerk of the legislative body written consent to the levy of an assessment under this chapter. An owner of land means one who appears as the owner in fee on the records of the county recorder on the date the consent is filed and includes an executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee as to property of an estate or trust represented by him. An owner may file his written consent at any time either prior to the adoption of the resolution of intention or prior to the hearing or during the hearing and prior to the conclusion thereof. Prior to the conclusion of the hearing the legislative body shall determine whether or not a majority consent has been filed and such determination shall be conclusive.



######### 35470.  
After the assessment roll is recorded, all persons are deemed to have notice of its contents.



######### 35471.  
Immediately upon the recording, the several assessments contained in the assessment roll are due and payable, and each assessment is a lien upon the property against which it is made. Unless sooner discharged, the lien shall continue for four years from the date of recording, or if bonds are issued to represent the assessment, the lien shall continue until the expiration of four years after the due date of the last installment upon the bonds or the last principal coupon attached to them.



######### 35472.  
The lien, whether bonds issued to represent the assessment or otherwise, shall be subordinate to all fixed special assessment liens previously imposed upon the same property, but it shall have priority over all fixed special assessment liens which may thereafter be created against the property. The lien of a reassessment and of a refunding assessment shall be the same as the original assessment to which it relates.



######### 35473.  
Any deed issued in the foreclosure of the assessment lien or sale of property for the lien conveys the property to the purchaser free and clear of all encumbrances, except taxes, and such special assessment liens as are, at the date of creation of the lien, equal or superior to the assessment lien.



######### 35474.  
Any action or proceeding to set aside, cancel, avoid, annul, or correct any assessment or reassessment, or to review any of the proceedings, acts, or determinations pursuant to this chapter, or to question the validity or enjoin the collection of any assessment or reassessment, or to enjoin the issuance of bonds to represent any assessment or reassessment, shall not be maintained by any person, unless such action or proceeding is commenced within 30 days after the recording of the diagram and assessment or reassessment. Thereafter all persons are barred from any such action or proceeding or any defense of invalidity of the assessment or reassessment, or of bonds issued on the assessment or reassessment.



######### 35475.  
Proceedings under this chapter shall not be attacked upon any ground not stated in an objection or protest filed pursuant to this chapter. Any landowner or person interested in any land within the district is estopped to attack the proceedings upon any ground not stated in an objection or protest filed by him pursuant to this chapter.



######### 35476.  
The officer with whom the assessment is recorded shall give notice that the assessment has been recorded in his office and that all sums assessed in it become due and payable upon the recordation of the assessment, stating the date of recordation and that the payment of the sums, in whole or in part, is to be made to him within 30 days after the date of recordation.



######### 35477.  
The notice shall also contain a statement that bonds to represent each assessment, or the unpaid balance thereof, remaining unpaid after 30 days will issue in the manner and form provided in this chapter, and shall state the period over which the bonds extend and the maximum rate of interest payable on them.



######### 35478.  
The notice shall be published twice in a daily or weekly newspaper of general circulation printed and published in the city in which the assessed land lies.



######### 35479.  
Notice shall also be given by mailing a post card to the owner of each lot, piece, or parcel of land assessed, according to the name and address appearing on the last equalized assessment roll prior to the recordation of the assessment or as known to the officer giving the notice.



######### 35480.  
Failure of the officer with whom the assessment is recorded to give notice by mailing, or of the person addressed to receive the notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings or the validity of the lien of any assessment or of any bond issued on the assessment.



######### 35481.  
When any payment is made upon an assessment, the street superintendent shall mark opposite the assessment “Paid in full” or “Paid in part,” as the case may be, the date of payment, the amount of payment, and the name of the person by or for whom the assessment is paid. If so requested, he shall give receipt for the payment.



######### 35482.  
After the expiration of 30 days from the date of recording the assessment, the superintendent of streets shall make a complete list of all assessments unpaid and the amounts unpaid, except assessments upon public property.



######### 35483.  
All unpaid assessments upon public property shall be collected pursuant to this article, but if the property is not in use in the performance of a public function, the lien of the assessment may be foreclosed in the mode provided for foreclosure of assessments in Chapter 18 (commencing with Section 5410) of Part 3 of Division 7 (the Improvement Act of 1911).

######### 35500.  
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to this article.



######### 35501.

Upon the filing of the list, the city treasurer shall make out and sign a separate bond representing upon each lot or parcel of land on the list the total amount of the unpaid assessment against it as shown on the list.



######### 35502.  
The legislative body shall sell the bonds for cash for not less than the amount of the assessments represented by the bonds.

######### 35510.  
The date of the bonds shall be the date selected and specified for that purpose by the legislative body in the resolution or order calling for sealed bids upon the bonds. The date shall be a date between the date of recordation of the assessment and the date of delivery of the bonds to the purchaser thereof. The bonds shall bear interest from their date.



######### 35511.  
Where an action or proceeding is brought to set aside, cancel, avoid, annul, or correct any assessment or reassessment, or to review any of the proceedings, acts or determinations pursuant to this chapter, or to question the validity or enjoin the collection of any assessment or reassessment or to enjoin the issuance of bonds to represent any assessment or reassessment, said action or proceeding being brought after recordation of the assessment or reassessment but before the sale and award of the bonds, the legislative body may issue and sell the bonds unless prevented by order of court and may, in its discretion, order: (1) that the bonds be dated and bear interest as provided in Section 35510, or (2) that the bonds be dated and bear interest from such date as may be specified by the legislative body, or (3) that notice of the assessment or reassessment be refiled in the office of the county recorder, in which case the time of recording as used in this part and in Section 4289 shall be the time of refiling such notice instead of the time of filing the original notice with the county recorder.



######### 35512.  
The bonds shall be substantially in the following form:

This bond is issued to provide funds necessary for the redemption of bonds for certain parking places in the City of ____ as the same are more fully described in assessment number ____ issued by the street superintendent of said city and recorded in his office. Its amount is the amount assessed in said assessment against the lot or parcel of land numbered therein, and in the diagram attached thereto, as number ____, and which now remains unpaid, and constitutes a lien upon the property affected thereby, as the same is described herein, and in said recorded assessment with its diagram, to wit: The lot or parcel of land in said City of ____, County of ____, State of California, described as follows: ______

This bond is payable exclusively from said fund, and neither the city nor any officer thereof is to be holden for payment otherwise of its principal or interest. The term of this bond is ____ years from the second day of January next succeeding the next ____ following its date, and at the expiration of said time the whole sum then unpaid shall be due and payable; but on the second day of January of each year, following the next ____ after its date, an even annual proportion of its whole amount is due and payable, upon presentation of the coupon therefor, until the whole is paid, with all accrued interest at the rate of ____ per centum per annum.

The interest is payable semiannually, to wit: On the second days of January and of July in each year hereafter, upon presentation of the coupons therefor, hereto attached, the first of which is for the interest from date to the next second day of ____ and thereafter the interest coupons are for semiannual interest.

This bond may be redeemed by the owner or any person interested in any lot or parcel of land described herein, in the manner provided in said law, at any time before maturity, and before commencement of proceedings for sale, upon payment to the treasurer, for the holder of this bond, of the amount then unpaid on the principal thereof, with interest thereon calculated up to the due date of the next maturing interest coupon, and all penalties accrued and unpaid together with a premium of 3 percent of the unpaid principal.

##### ARTICLE 4. Disposition of Funds [35520 - 35522]  

######### 35520.  
From time to time the street superintendent shall pay to the treasurer all money collected by him on account of any assessment levied pursuant to this chapter.

On receipt of the money the treasurer shall place it in the fund for the redemption of the bonds issued pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 35400) of this part.  All proceeds of any bonds issued pursuant to this chapter shall also be placed in such fund.



######### 35521.  
Moneys in the fund clearly in excess of the amount necessary to redeem the outstanding bonds as hereinafter provided may be used to pay the costs and expenses referred to in Section 35464. The balance of the fund shall be a trust fund pledged to and held for the benefit of the holders of the outstanding bonds issued pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 35400) of this part, and until the bonds and the interest thereon have been fully paid the balance shall be used for no purpose other than the payment of the principal thereof, the interest thereon, and any premiums payable upon the call thereof. If the bonds, or any portion thereof, are to be called for redemption, the city shall immediately give notice of such redemption in the manner and form provided in the ordinance, resolution or indenture under which the bonds were issued, even though the notice may be premature as to time, but if the notice is premature the city shall later give the notice again within the proper time. As soon as the notice, even though premature, has been given and as soon as there are moneys in the fund clearly sufficient to pay the principal of all of the bonds, all interest to maturity or to the call date stated in the notice as the case may be, and all premiums to which bondholders will be entitled by reason of the call, the city is discharged from all obligations under this part or under the ordinance, resolution or indenture to make charges for the use of, or produce revenues from, parking places of the district or parking meters on streets, but the city shall continue to be bound by all other provisions of the ordinance, resolution or indenture.



######### 35522.

##### ARTICLE 5. Reassessment [35530 - 35549.1]  

######### 35530.  
A reassessment shall be issued in any of the following events:

(a) When an assessment made, issued, or filed in the office of the clerk, or any bonds issued to represent the amounts of any such assessment, have been set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction, or when the court has refused to enforce an assessment or has decreed any such bonds not to constitute or represent valid and subsisting liens against the lots or parcels of land upon which the assessments represented by them have been levied.

(b) If for any reason the assessments or bonds, or both, are not effective and the curative and waiver provisions of this chapter or any curative act passed by the Legislature in relation to them fail to make them valid and enforceable.   

(c) Upon the initiative of the legislative body if the legislative body is of the opinion that all or any part of the assessments or bonds are not enforceable.



######### 35531.  
It is the intent of this article to make the cost of the redemption of bonds issued pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 35400) of this part through an attempted compliance with this chapter payable by the real property benefited by the parking place for which such bonds were issued by making a reassessment for that purpose. The power of reassessment embraces both a full and partial reassessment, and is not exhausted by a single attempted exercise of the power.



######### 35532.  
Whenever the owner or holder of any bonds issued to represent or to be secured by assessments requests the legislative body to order a reassessment and the legislative body is of the opinion that such bonds are not enforceable, it shall order the making and issuing of a reassessment covering only the assessments represented by, or securing the bonds owned or held by, the petitioner.



######### 35533.  
If, in any suit involving the validity of the obligation of any bond or assessment, a court of competent jurisdiction for any reason holds the lien of the assessment or bond to be unenforceable, the court in and by its decree shall direct the making of a reassessment to cover the assessments involved in the suit.



######### 35534.  
If, in any suit to set aside the lien of any assessment or of any bond representing any assessment, or in any suit to quiet title against the lien of any such assessment or bond, or in any suit to enjoin the making, filing, confirmation, or issuance of any assessment or bond to pay for the cost and expenses of any acquisition and improvement pursuant to this part, a court of competent jurisdiction in its judgment decrees such assessments or bonds to be void or unenforceable or enjoins the making, filing, issuance, or confirmation of any such assessment or bond, the court in and by its decree shall direct the making of a reassessment to cover the assessments involved in the suit.



######### 35535.  
If, in any suit contesting the validity and legal force and effect of a sale to foreclose the lien of any assessment or bond, a court of competent jurisdiction decrees the sale to be void or unenforceable for any reason, the court in and by its decree shall direct the making of a reassessment to cover the assessments involved in the suit.



######### 35536.  
If a reassessment is directed, by a decree of court or by an order of the legislative body, the street superintendent shall proceed to make a reassessment.



######### 35537.  
If the reassessment is a partial one only, it is not necessary for the diagram to show any lots other than those covered by the partial reassessment. If it is a full reassessment, the street superintendent shall prepare and file with the reassessment a diagram showing the lots or parcels of land deemed by him to be benefited by the parking place for which the bonds were issued.



######### 35538.  
The reassessment shall assess upon and against each of the lots or parcels of land contained in it an amount determined as follows:

(a) The benefits derived by each of the lots or parcels of land from the parking place for which the bonds were issued estimated as of the date of the filing in the clerk’s office of the original assessment shall first be listed.

(b) Interest shall be added to amounts determined pursuant to (a) from the date of recording of the original assessment at the rate of 7 percent a year.



######### 35539.  
The total of the reassessment, exclusive of interest, shall not exceed the total amount necessary for the redemption of the bonds which are outstanding.



######### 35540.  
The reassessment need not be in any prescribed form. It shall:

(a) Refer to the original assessment and set forth the date it was filed.

(b) State that it is made pursuant to the order of the legislative body or decree of court, as the case may be.

(c) Be accompanied by a diagram showing the lots or parcels of land to be reassessed and their relation to the parking place for which the bonds were issued.  



######### 35541.  
The reassessment shall be presented to the legislative body, which shall fix a time for hearing. The hearing shall be at least 20 days after the presentation of the reassessment.



######### 35542.  
The clerk shall advertise the time of hearing by publishing a notice in the newspaper in the city in which the parking place for which the bonds were issued is located. The notice shall be published for five insertions, if the newspaper is a daily, or for two insertions if the newspaper is published less frequently. If the reassessment is to be against the property in a district, this fact shall be set forth and the reassessment diagram referred to for particulars.



######### 35543.  
At the time fixed for the hearing, or at any time to which the hearing is adjourned, the legislative body shall consider the objections to the reassessment and may informally direct the revision, correction, and modification of the reassessment in such manner as is most equitable to apportion to each lot or parcel of land benefited the amount of the actual benefits derived from the parking place.



######### 35544.  
When the reassessment is revised, corrected, or modified to comply with its judgment the legislative body shall pass a resolution confirming the reassessment.



######### 35545.  
The clerk shall certify at the end of the reassessment, that it is the reassessment approved by the legislative body.



######### 35546.  
The street superintendent shall record the reassessment with the clerk’s certificate.

######### 35548.  
The reassessment shall be collected, paid, and enforced in the same manner as an original assessment, and shall have the same weight in evidence.



######### 35549.  
If bonds were issued under or upon the security of the original assessment, they shall issue upon the reassessment for the sum reassessed against the lots or parcel of land covered by it.



######### 35549.1.  
When the reassessment is recorded, the original assessment shall be canceled by the street superintendent so far as it affects the particular assessments involved. New bonds shall not be issued until the original bonds are delivered up to the treasurer who shall cancel them. The lien of the reassessment shall hold its relative rank as to other special assessment liens as of the date of filing of the original assessment.








##### CHAPTER 4. Parking Place Commission [35550 - 35573]  

######### 35550.  
Immediately upon the acquisition of the parking places, a parking place commission shall be appointed. In the discretion of the legislative body, the commission may be appointed at any time prior to such acquisition and after the adoption of the ordinance declaring the district formed.



######### 35550.1.  
At its discretion, the legislative body of any city may, by ordinance, provide for the appointment, removal, qualifications, terms of office and numbers of members of parking place commissioners for such city. Such board shall have all of the powers and duties of parking place commissioners appointed under this part. Such board, so appointed, may be an existing board created by city charter or ordinance or a new board created by ordinance. Such board may act for all vehicle parking districts established within said city under this part.



######### 35551.  
The commission shall consist of three members, each of whom shall be a resident and qualified elector of the city.



######### 35552.  
Members of the commission shall serve without compensation, unless the legislative body determines that compensation shall be paid and fixes the compensation to be paid from funds of the city.



######### 35553.  
Members of the commission shall be appointed by the chief executive officer of the city, subject to confirmation by the legislative body.



######### 35554.  
The commissioners shall hold office for the term of three years from the date of their appointment and qualification and until their successors are appointed and qualify, except that members of the first commission appointed shall classify themselves by lot so that one member holds office for one year, one for two years, and one for three years, and, in each instance, until a successor has been appointed and qualified.



######### 35554.5.  
A commissioner appointed to fill a vacancy created by the death, resignation, incapacity or removal of a commissioner shall hold office for the unexpired term of the former incumbent.



######### 35555.  
A commissioner may be removed by a four-fifths vote of the legislative body at any time.



######### 35556.  
Commissioners shall be persons of business experience and ability, to the end that the affairs of the district shall be administered in the interests of the district.



######### 35557.  
Whenever a petition signed by the owners of real property in the district of an assessed value of more than fifty percent (50%) of the total assessed value of the taxable real property in the district, as shown by the last equalized assessment roll, requesting the removal of a commissioner is filed with the legislative body it shall immediately remove him and appoint a new commissioner. The commissioner removed is ineligible to hold office as a commissioner of the district for one year following his removal.



######### 35558.  
The parking places acquired are under the jurisdiction and control of the commission of the district.



######### 35559.  
The commission shall operate, manage, and control the parking places and make and enforce all necessary rules for their use.



######### 35560.  
The commission may fix, regulate, and collect rentals, fees, or other charges for the use of parking places under its control, and may provide different rates for different classes of customers, or users, provided that such rentals, fees or other charges shall be sufficient to produce funds to comply with the terms of the ordinance, resolution, or indenture providing for the issuance of bonds. Such rentals, fees, or other charges shall be fixed after public hearing following such notice as the commission may prescribe.



######### 35561.  
The providing of adequate public parking places in cities largely depends upon the formation of parking districts. Such districts will be created and will be successful only if so operated as to serve adequately the property within the district. It is the intent of this part, if the ordinance, resolution, or indenture providing for the issuance of the bonds provides for the levy of an ad valorem assessment upon the taxable real property in the district, that the owners of real property in a parking district created pursuant to this part to provide parking places to solve the parking problems of the district may receive preferential rates, charges, or rentals for themselves, their tenants, and the classes of persons who call upon or do business with them, all to the end that the property which bears the burden and provides a solution for the parking problem shall receive a special benefit.



######### 35562.  
All parking places acquired and constructed pursuant to this part are public parking places, but, if the ordinance, resolution, or indenture providing for the issuance of the bonds provides for the levy of an ad valorem assessment upon the taxable real property in the district, the commission may restrict or partially restrict their use to owners and tenants of real property in the district, and classes of persons designated by such owners or their tenants and may establish rates, charges, or rentals for the owners and tenants of such properties and classes of persons designated by the owners or tenants which differ from and are less than the rates, charges, or rentals charged other persons.



######### 35564.  
All employees required for the proper operation, management, and control of the parking places acquired and constructed under this part shall be city employees selected as other city employees are selected. The number of such employees and their salaries shall be determined by the legislative body unless, by ordinance, which may be adopted or repealed at any time, the power to make such determination is granted to the board. Any salary or wage so fixed shall in each instance be at least equal to the prevailing salary or wage for the same quality of services rendered to private persons, firms or corporations in the city under similar employment, in case such prevailing salary or wage can be ascertained.



######### 35565.  
The commission shall fix such rentals, fees, or charges for the use of parking places under its control as will produce revenue, when added to the expected revenues from on-street parking meters pledged to any of the purposes specified in this part, sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the bonds as they fall due, and also to provide any additional sums which may be required under the provisions of the ordinance, resolution or indenture providing for the issuance of the bonds.



######### 35566.  
If the petition for the formation of a district and the resolution of intention to form the district state that this section and Section 35414.1 shall apply to proceedings taken pursuant thereto, Section 35565 shall not apply and the provisions of this section shall apply. The commission shall fix such rentals, fees or other charges for the use of parking places under its control as will produce revenue, when added to the expected revenues from on-street parking meters, assessments or other sources pledged to any of the purposes specified in this part, sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the bonds as they fall due, and also to provide any additional sums which may be required under the provisions of the ordinance, resolution or indenture providing for the issuance of the bonds.



######### 35567.  
The commission shall abide by all covenants made by the legislative body in the issuance of the bonds.



######### 35568.  
In the exercise of its power to operate, manage, and control parking places, the commission may lease any or all parking places to any person for the sole purpose of the operation of public parking facilities on them by such person, or may make a contract with any person for such purpose. The consideration to be paid by the operator for any lease or under any contract may be a fixed sum or a percentage of gross rentals, fees, or charges collected by the operator, or any other consideration.



######### 35569.  
The maximum rentals, fees, and charges to be collected by the operator shall be fixed by the commission after public hearing following such notice as the commission prescribes, and shall be recited in the lease or contract. No higher rentals, fees, or charges shall be collected by the operator without amendment of the lease or contract agreed to by the commission after like public hearing.



######### 35570.  
The commission or any operator shall not conduct any business other than that of the operation of public parking facilities on any parking place of the district.



######### 35571.  
If the ordinance, resolution, or indenture providing for the issuance of the bonds provides for the levy of an ad valorem assessment upon the taxable real property in the district, any lease or contract may provide that the use of the parking places shall be restricted, or partially restricted, to owners and tenants of real property in the district, and classes of persons designated by them, and may provide for maximum rates, charges, or rentals for such persons which differ from and are less than the maximum rates, charges, or rentals charged other persons.



######### 35572.  
To provide revenues for the district, at any time prior to the formation of the district, or after the formation of the district and prior to the appointment of a commission, the legislative body conducting the proceeding for the formation of the district may enter into a contract or lease with any owner or tenant of property in the district under which the owner or tenant, for a specified rental or other consideration and for a specified period not exceeding 10 years, reserves a reasonable proportion or number of parking spaces in a parking place of the district for the use of the owner or tenant of such property, the employees of the owner or tenant performing services on the property, and the customers of, or other classes of persons designated by, the owner or tenant and entering the property as invitees or otherwise. After the appointment of a commission, the commission may make such contracts or leases.



######### 35573.  
If the petition for the formation of a district under this part expressly so authorizes, at any time and following a hearing after such notice as the legislative body prescribes, it may determine that no parking place commission shall be appointed for such district, or if the commission has been appointed, may dissolve the commission. In either event, the legislative body shall thereafter have all powers, jurisdiction, and authority granted to, and all duties imposed upon, the commission pursuant to this part. The legislative body at any time thereafter may appoint or reappoint a commission.








##### CHAPTER 5. Miscellaneous [35700 - 35708]  

######### 35700.  
Notwithstanding any agreement made pursuant to this part, as a covenant to bondholders or otherwise, to maintain parking meters on specified public ways in the district, parking meters need not be maintained:

(a) On any public way which has become a “freeway” or a “state highway” as defined in Sections 23.5 and 24.

(b) At any time and so long as both (1) the net revenues from the parking places of the district during each of the two next previous fiscal years and available for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds of the district equaled or exceeded one and one-half times the principal and interest which has or will come due during the current fiscal year, and (2) the money in the fund to pay principal and interest on the bonds equals or exceeds all amounts coming due on principal and interest during the next following 12 months.

(c) At any time and so long as the money in the fund to pay principal and interest on the bonds of the district equals the total of the outstanding bonds and interest thereon to maturity.

(d) At any time after the bonds of the district and the interest thereon have been fully paid.

(e) On a public way, or portion thereof, if the holders of not less than sixty percent (60%) of the outstanding bonds have agreed in writing that the maintenance of parking meters on the public way, or portion thereof, may be discontinued.



######### 35701.  
Any agreement to maintain parking meters on a public way shall not affect the right of a city, acting by virtue of its police power, to control, regulate, or prohibit the parking of vehicles on any public way, or portion thereof, to the extent necessary to protect the public safety.



######### 35702.  
All property acquired pursuant to this part shall be condemned or acquired in the name of the city, and title to such property shall be in the city, subject to the provisions of this part.



######### 35703.  
In instances where a district is formed under this part in any charter city, if under the provisions of the charter any power, jurisdiction, authority or duty cannot be performed or exercised in the manner, or by the body or officer, prescribed in this part, such power, jurisdiction, authority or duty shall be performed or exercised in the manner, or by the body or officer, prescribed by such charter.



######### 35704.  
As long as any of the bonds of the district or any interest thereon remains unpaid, the parking places acquired for the district shall be used as public parking places unless the legislative body makes the determination provided in Section 35706.



######### 35705.  
After the bonds of the district and all interest thereon have been paid the property shall continue to be used as public parking places. However, such use may be discontinued as to such property or any portion thereof if the legislative body, after public hearing following such notice thereof as the legislative body may prescribe, determines by a four-fifths vote of all its members that the public interest and necessity and the needs of the district no longer require that such property, or such portion thereof, be used as public parking places. Thereafter the property as to which such determination is made may be used by the city for any public purpose or it may be sold as other city property is sold when no longer needed for a public purpose. If any ad valorem assessment has been levied upon the real property in the district as provided in this part, then the proceeds of such sale shall be used to make refund of such assessments to the then owner of each parcel of real property which has been so assessed in the proportion which the total assessments levied upon such parcel bears to the total of all such assessments, but no refund as to any parcel shall exceed the total assessments theretofore paid in respect of said parcel, and any portion of the proceeds remaining after such refunds have been made shall be placed in the general fund of the city.



######### 35706.  
As an alternative to the provisions of Section 35705, and to the extent authorized in the covenants contained in the ordinance, resolution or indenture providing for the issuance of the bonds, the use of any of the properties as public parking places may be discontinued as to such property or any portion thereof if the legislative body, after public hearing following notice thereof published pursuant to Section 6061 of the Government Code in one or more newspapers circulated in the city at least ten (10) days before said hearing, determines by a four-fifths vote of all its members that the public interest and necessity and the needs of the district no longer require that such property, or such portion thereof, be used as public parking places. Thereafter the property as to which such determination is made may be used by the city for any public purpose or may be sold as other city property is sold when no longer needed for a public purpose. The proceeds of such sale shall be used as provided in said covenants.



######### 35707.  
All claims for money or damages against the district are governed by Part 3 (commencing with Section 900) and Part 4 (commencing with Section 940) of Division 3.6 of Title 1 of the Government Code except as provided therein, or by other statutes or regulations expressly applicable thereto.



######### 35708.  
At any time following the formation of a district under this part and the issuance of the initial issue of bonds, any parcel of land may be added to the district if the owner of such parcel files with the legislative body a petition for such inclusion and the legislative body grants such petition. The legislative body shall not grant such petition until the petition has been approved by the parking place commission of the district and until a determination has been made by the legislative body and approved by the parking place commission as to the amount, if any, to be paid by such petitioner as an annexation fee and until the owner of such parcel has paid to the city such total fee, if any. The amount paid to the city shall be placed in the fund in which the proceeds of an ad valorem assessment would be placed. If such petition is granted, such parcel shall thereafter be entitled to the same rights as those which apply to other lands in the district and shall be subject to all ad valorem assessments thereafter levied in the district under this part.

#### PART 6. PARKING AND BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT AREA LAW OF 1989 [36500 - 36551]  

#### CHAPTER 1. General Provisions [36500 - 36515]  


##### ARTICLE 1. Declarations [36500 - 36504]  

######### 36500.  
This part shall be known and may be cited as the “Parking and Business Improvement Area Law of 1989.”



######### 36501.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares that businesses located and operating within the business districts of this state’s communities are economically disadvantaged, are underutilized, and are unable to attract customers due to inadequate facilities, services, and activities in the business districts.  

(b) The Legislature also finds and declares that it is in the public interest to promote the economic revitalization and physical maintenance of the business districts of its cities in order to create jobs, attract new businesses, and prevent erosion of the business districts.  

(c) The Legislature also finds that it is of particular local benefit to allow cities to fund property related improvements and activities through the levy of assessments upon the businesses which benefit from those improvements and activities.  

(d) The Legislature also finds and declares that tourism is a large and growing contributor to California’s economy, and that promotion of a city’s or county’s scenic, recreational, cultural, and other attractions as a tourist destination is an important public purpose.  

(e) The Legislature also finds and declares that assessments levied for the purpose of providing improvements and promoting activities which benefit individual businesses may also benefit the property within the area directly or indirectly and that those assessments are not taxes for the general benefit of a city, but are assessments for the improvements and activities which confer special benefits upon the businesses for which the improvements and activities are provided.



######### 36502.  
The purpose of this part is to recodify and supplant previously enacted provisions of law which authorize cities to levy assessments on businesses within a parking and business improvement area and to provide a uniform procedure to levy assessments for improvements and activities of businesses located and operating in a business district of a city. This part does not affect or limit any other provisions of law authorizing or providing for the furnishing of improvements or activities or the raising of revenue for these purposes. In addition, this part is intended to provide a method for financing public programs to attract tourist visits to areas where tourism is economically important and desired.



######### 36503.  
Any provision of this part which conflicts with any other provision of law shall prevail over the other provision of law.



######### 36504.  
This part is intended to be construed liberally and, if any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. If the provisions of this part respecting the levying of assessments are held invalid in any area within which assessments have been levied pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 36530), the assessments shall be reimposed in an identical amount and upon the same businesses as a matter of law and no lapse in the levy of any assessment shall be deemed to have occurred. Assessments levied under this part are not special taxes.









##### ARTICLE 2. Definitions [36505 - 36513]  

######### 36505.  
“Advisory board” means the advisory board or commission appointed by the city council pursuant to Section 36530.

######### 36508.

#### PART 7. PROPERTY AND BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT LAW OF 1994 [36600 - 36671]  

#### CHAPTER 1. General Provisions [36600 - 36617]  


##### ARTICLE 1. Declarations [36600 - 36604]  

######### 36600.  
This part shall be known and may be cited as the “Property and Business Improvement District Law of 1994.”



######### 36601.  
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) Businesses located and operating within business districts in some of this state’s communities are economically disadvantaged, are underutilized, and are unable to attract customers due to inadequate facilities, services, and activities in the business districts.

(b) It is in the public interest to promote the economic revitalization and physical maintenance of business districts in order to create jobs, attract new businesses, and prevent the erosion of the business districts.

(c) It is of particular local benefit to allow business districts to fund business related improvements, maintenance, and activities through the levy of assessments upon the businesses or real property that receive benefits from those improvements.

(d) Assessments levied for the purpose of conferring special benefit upon the real property or a specific benefit upon the businesses in a business district are not taxes for the general benefit of a city, even if property, businesses, or persons not assessed receive incidental or collateral effects that benefit them.

(e) Property and business improvement districts formed throughout this state have conferred special benefits upon properties and businesses within their districts and have made those properties and businesses more useful by providing the following benefits:

(1) Crime reduction. A study by the Rand Corporation has confirmed a 12-percent reduction in the incidence of robbery and an 8-percent reduction in the total incidence of violent crimes within the 30 districts studied.

(2) Job creation.

(3) Business attraction.

(4) Business retention.

(5) Economic growth.

(6) New investments.

(f) With the dissolution of redevelopment agencies throughout the state, property and business improvement districts have become even more important tools with which communities can combat blight, promote economic opportunities, and create a clean and safe environment.

(g) Since the enactment of this act, the people of California have adopted Proposition 218, which added Article XIII D to the Constitution in order to place certain requirements and restrictions on the formation of, and activities, expenditures, and assessments by property-based districts. Article XIII D of the Constitution provides that property-based districts may only levy assessments for special benefits.

(h) The act amending this section is intended to provide the Legislature’s guidance with regard to this act, its interaction with the provisions of Article XIII D of the Constitution, and the determination of special benefits in property-based districts.

(1) The lack of legislative guidance has resulted in uncertainty and inconsistent application of this act, which discourages the use of assessments to fund needed improvements, maintenance, and activities in property-based districts, contributing to blight and other underutilization of property.

(2) Activities undertaken for the purpose of conferring special benefits upon property to be assessed inherently produce incidental or collateral effects that benefit property or persons not assessed. Therefore, for special benefits to exist as a separate and distinct category from general benefits, the incidental or collateral effects of those special benefits are inherently part of those special benefits. The mere fact that special benefits produce incidental or collateral effects that benefit property or persons not assessed does not convert any portion of those special benefits or their incidental or collateral effects into general benefits.

(3) It is of the utmost importance that property-based districts created under this act have clarity regarding restrictions on assessments they may levy and the proper determination of special benefits. Legislative clarity with regard to this act will provide districts with clear instructions and courts with legislative intent regarding restrictions on property-based assessments, and the manner in which special benefits should be determined.



######### 36602.  
The purpose of this part is to supplement previously enacted provisions of law that authorize cities to levy assessments within property and business improvement districts, to ensure that those assessments conform to all constitutional requirements and are determined and assessed in accordance with the guidance set forth in this act. This part does not affect or limit any other provisions of law authorizing or providing for the furnishing of improvements or activities or the raising of revenue for these purposes.



######### 36603.  
Nothing in this part is intended to preempt the authority of a charter city to adopt ordinances providing for a different method of levying assessments for similar or additional purposes from those set forth in this part. A property and business improvement district created pursuant to this part is expressly exempt from the provisions of the Special Assessment Investigation, Limitation and Majority Protest Act of 1931 (Division 4 (commencing with Section 2800)).



######### 36603.5.  
Any provision of this part that conflicts with any other provision of law shall prevail over the other provision of law, as to districts created under this part.



######### 36604.  
This part is intended to be construed liberally and, if any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Assessments levied under this part are not special taxes.

Notwithstanding this section, an owners’ association shall comply with the Ralph M. Brown Act (Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 54950) of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code), at all times when matters within the subject matter of the district are heard, discussed, or deliberated, and with the California Public Records Act (Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1 of the Government Code), for all records relating to activities of the district.

Special benefit includes incidental or collateral effects that arise from the improvements, maintenance, or activities of property-based districts even if those incidental or collateral effects benefit property or persons not assessed. Special benefit excludes general enhancement of property value.

(b) “Special benefit” also includes, for purposes of a property-based district, a particular and distinct benefit provided directly to each assessed parcel within the district. Merely because parcels throughout an assessment district share the same special benefits does not make the benefits general.

######### 36620.5.  
A county may not form a district within the territorial jurisdiction of a city without the consent of the city council of that city. A city may not form a district within the unincorporated territory of a county without the consent of the board of supervisors of that county. A city may not form a district within the territorial jurisdiction of another city without the consent of the city council of the other city.



######### 36621.  
(a) Upon the submission of a written petition, signed by the property or business owners in the proposed district who will pay more than 50 percent of the assessments proposed to be levied, the city council may initiate proceedings to form a district by the adoption of a resolution expressing its intention to form a district. The amount of assessment attributable to property or a business owned by the same property or business owner that is in excess of 40 percent of the amount of all assessments proposed to be levied, shall not be included in determining whether the petition is signed by property or business owners who will pay more than 50 percent of the total amount of assessments proposed to be levied.

(b) The petition of property or business owners required under subdivision (a) shall include a summary of the management district plan. That summary shall include all of the following:

(1) A map showing the boundaries of the district.

(2) Information specifying where the complete management district plan can be obtained.

(3) Information specifying that the complete management district plan shall be furnished upon request.

(c) The resolution of intention described in subdivision (a) shall contain all of the following:

(1) A brief description of the proposed improvements, maintenance, and activities, the amount of the proposed assessment, a statement as to whether the assessment will be levied on property or businesses within the district, a statement as to whether bonds will be issued, and a description of the exterior boundaries of the proposed district, which may be made by reference to any plan or map that is on file with the clerk. The descriptions and statements do not need to be detailed and shall be sufficient if they enable an owner to generally identify the nature and extent of the improvements, maintenance, and activities, and the location and extent of the proposed district.

(2) A time and place for a public hearing on the establishment of the property and business improvement district and the levy of assessments, which shall be consistent with the requirements of Section 36623.



######### 36622.  
The management district plan shall include, but is not limited to, all of the following:

(a) If the assessment will be levied on property, a map of the district in sufficient detail to locate each parcel of property and, if businesses are to be assessed, each business within the district. If the assessment will be levied on businesses, a map that identifies the district boundaries in sufficient detail to allow a business owner to reasonably determine whether a business is located within the district boundaries. If the assessment will be levied on property and businesses, a map of the district in sufficient detail to locate each parcel of property and to allow a business owner to reasonably determine whether a business is located within the district boundaries.

(b) The name of the proposed district.

(c) A description of the boundaries of the district, including the boundaries of benefit zones, proposed for establishment or extension in a manner sufficient to identify the affected property and businesses included, which may be made by reference to any plan or map that is on file with the clerk. The boundaries of a proposed property assessment district shall not overlap with the boundaries of another existing property assessment district created pursuant to this part. This part does not prohibit the boundaries of a district created pursuant to this part to overlap with other assessment districts established pursuant to other provisions of law, including, but not limited to, the Parking and Business Improvement Area Law of 1989 (Part 6 (commencing with Section 36500)). This part does not prohibit the boundaries of a business assessment district created pursuant to this part to overlap with another business assessment district created pursuant to this part. This part does not prohibit the boundaries of a business assessment district created pursuant to this part to overlap with a property assessment district created pursuant to this part.

(d) The improvements, maintenance, and activities proposed for each year of operation of the district and the estimated cost thereof. If the improvements, maintenance, and activities proposed for each year of operation are the same, a description of the first year’s proposed improvements, maintenance, and activities and a statement that the same improvements, maintenance, and activities are proposed for subsequent years shall satisfy the requirements of this subdivision.

(e) The total annual amount proposed to be expended for improvements, maintenance, or activities, and debt service in each year of operation of the district. If the assessment is levied on businesses, this amount may be estimated based upon the assessment rate. If the total annual amount proposed to be expended in each year of operation of the district is not significantly different, the amount proposed to be expended in the initial year and a statement that a similar amount applies to subsequent years shall satisfy the requirements of this subdivision.

(f) The proposed source or sources of financing, including the proposed method and basis of levying the assessment in sufficient detail to allow each property or business owner to calculate the amount of the assessment to be levied against their property or business. The plan also shall state whether bonds will be issued to finance improvements.

(g) The time and manner of collecting the assessments.

(h) The specific number of years in which assessments will be levied. In a new district, the maximum number of years shall be five. Upon renewal, a district shall have a term not to exceed 10 years. Notwithstanding these limitations, a district created pursuant to this part to finance capital improvements with bonds may levy assessments until the maximum maturity of the bonds. The management district plan may set forth specific increases in assessments for each year of operation of the district.

(i) The proposed time for implementation and completion of the management district plan.

(j) Any proposed rules and regulations to be applicable to the district.

(k) (1) A list of the properties or businesses to be assessed, including the assessor’s parcel numbers for properties to be assessed, and a statement of the method or methods by which the expenses of a district will be imposed upon benefited real property or businesses, in proportion to the benefit received by the property or business, to defray the cost thereof.

(2) In a property-based district, the proportionate special benefit derived by each identified parcel shall be determined exclusively in relationship to the entirety of the capital cost of a public improvement, the maintenance and operation expenses of a public improvement, or the cost of the activities. An assessment shall not be imposed on any parcel that exceeds the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit conferred on that parcel. Only special benefits are assessable, and a property-based district shall separate the general benefits, if any, from the special benefits conferred on a parcel. Parcels within a property-based district that are owned or used by any city, public agency, the State of California, or the United States shall not be exempt from assessment unless the governmental entity can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that those publicly owned parcels in fact receive no special benefit. The value of any incidental, secondary, or collateral effects that arise from the improvements, maintenance, or activities of a property-based district and that benefit property or persons not assessed shall not be deducted from the entirety of the cost of any special benefit or affect the proportionate special benefit derived by each identified parcel.

(3) In a property-based district, properties throughout the district may share the same special benefits. In a district with boundaries that define which parcels are to receive improvements, maintenance, or activities over and above those services provided by the city, the improvements, maintenance, or activities themselves may constitute a special benefit. The city may impose assessments that are less than the proportional special benefit conferred, but shall not impose assessments that exceed the reasonable costs of the proportional special benefit conferred. Because one or more parcels pay less than the special benefit conferred does not necessarily mean that other parcels are assessed more than the reasonable cost of their special benefit.

(l) In a property-based district, a detailed engineer’s report prepared by a registered professional engineer certified by the State of California supporting all assessments contemplated by the management district plan.

(m) Any other item or matter required to be incorporated therein by the city council.



######### 36623.  
(a) If a city council proposes to levy a new or increased property assessment, the notice and protest and hearing procedure shall comply with Section 53753 of the Government Code.

(b) If a city council proposes to levy a new or increased business assessment, the notice and protest and hearing procedure shall comply with Section 54954.6 of the Government Code, except that notice shall be mailed to the owners of the businesses proposed to be assessed. A protest may be made orally or in writing by any interested person. Every written protest shall be filed with the clerk at or before the time fixed for the public hearing. The city council may waive any irregularity in the form or content of any written protest. A written protest may be withdrawn in writing at any time before the conclusion of the public hearing. Each written protest shall contain a description of the business in which the person subscribing the protest is interested sufficient to identify the business and, if a person subscribing is not shown on the official records of the city as the owner of the business, the protest shall contain or be accompanied by written evidence that the person subscribing is the owner of the business or the authorized representative. A written protest that does not comply with this section shall not be counted in determining a majority protest. If written protests are received from the owners or authorized representatives of businesses in the proposed district that will pay 50 percent or more of the assessments proposed to be levied and protests are not withdrawn so as to reduce the protests to less than 50 percent, no further proceedings to levy the proposed assessment against such businesses, as contained in the resolution of intention, shall be taken for a period of one year from the date of the finding of a majority protest by the city council.

(c) If a city council proposes to conduct a single proceeding to levy both a new or increased property assessment and a new or increased business assessment, the notice and protest and hearing procedure for the property assessment shall comply with subdivision (a), and the notice and protest and hearing procedure for the business assessment shall comply with subdivision (b). If a majority protest is received from either the property or business owners, that respective portion of the assessment shall not be levied. The remaining portion of the assessment may be levied unless the improvement or other special benefit was proposed to be funded by assessing both property and business owners.



######### 36624.  
At the conclusion of the public hearing to establish the district, the city council may adopt, revise, change, reduce, or modify the proposed assessment or the type or types of improvements, maintenance, and activities to be funded with the revenues from the assessments. Proposed assessments may only be revised by reducing any or all of them. At the public hearing, the city council may only make changes in, to, or from the boundaries of the proposed property and business improvement district that will exclude territory that will not benefit from the proposed improvements, maintenance, and activities. Any modifications, revisions, reductions, or changes to the proposed assessment district shall be reflected in the notice and map recorded pursuant to Section 36627.



######### 36625.  
(a) If the city council, following the public hearing, decides to establish a proposed property and business improvement district, the city council shall adopt a resolution of formation that shall include, but is not limited to, all of the following:

(1) A brief description of the proposed improvements, maintenance, and activities, the amount of the proposed assessment, a statement as to whether the assessment will be levied on property, businesses, or both within the district, a statement on whether bonds will be issued, and a description of the exterior boundaries of the proposed district, which may be made by reference to any plan or map that is on file with the clerk. The descriptions and statements need not be detailed and shall be sufficient if they enable an owner to generally identify the nature and extent of the improvements, maintenance, and activities and the location and extent of the proposed district.

(2) The number, date of adoption, and title of the resolution of intention.

(3) The time and place where the public hearing was held concerning the establishment of the district.

(4) A determination regarding any protests received. The city shall not establish the district or levy assessments if a majority protest was received.

(5) A statement that the properties, businesses, or properties and businesses in the district established by the resolution shall be subject to any amendments to this part.

(6) A statement that the improvements, maintenance, and activities to be conferred on businesses and properties in the district will be funded by the levy of the assessments. The revenue from the levy of assessments within a district shall not be used to provide improvements, maintenance, or activities outside the district or for any purpose other than the purposes specified in the resolution of intention, as modified by the city council at the hearing concerning establishment of the district. Notwithstanding the foregoing, improvements and activities that must be provided outside the district boundaries to create a special or specific benefit to the assessed parcels or businesses may be provided, but shall be limited to marketing or signage pointing to the district.

(7) A finding that the property or businesses within the area of the property and business improvement district will be benefited by the improvements, maintenance, and activities funded by the proposed assessments, and, for a property-based district, that property within the district will receive a special benefit.

(8) In a property-based district, the total amount of all special benefits to be conferred on the properties within the property-based district.

(b) The adoption of the resolution of formation and, if required, recordation of the notice and map pursuant to Section 36627 shall constitute the levy of an assessment in each of the fiscal years referred to in the management district plan.



######### 36627.  
Following adoption of the resolution establishing district assessments on properties pursuant to Section 36625, the clerk shall record a notice and an assessment diagram pursuant to Section 3114. No other provision of Division 4.5 (commencing with Section 3100) applies to an assessment district created pursuant to this part.



######### 36628.  
The city council may establish one or more separate benefit zones within the district based upon the degree of benefit derived from the improvements or activities to be provided within the benefit zone and may impose a different assessment within each benefit zone.  If the assessment is to be levied on businesses, the city council may also define categories of businesses based upon the degree of benefit that each will derive from the improvements or activities to be provided within the district and may impose a different assessment or rate of assessment on each category of business, or on each category of business within each zone.



######### 36628.5.  
The city council may levy assessments on businesses or on property owners, or a combination of the two, pursuant to this part. The city council shall structure the assessments in whatever manner it determines corresponds with the distribution of benefits from the proposed improvements, maintenance, and activities, provided that any property-based assessment conforms with the requirements set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (k) of Section 36622.



######### 36629.  
All provisions of this part applicable to the establishment, modification, or disestablishment of a property and business improvement district apply to the establishment, modification, or disestablishment of benefit zones or categories of business. The city council shall, to establish, modify, or disestablish a benefit zone or category of business, follow the procedure to establish, modify, or disestablish a property and business improvement district.



######### 36630.  
If a property and business improvement district expires due to the time limit set pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 36622, a new management district plan may be created and the district may be renewed pursuant to this part.








##### CHAPTER 3. Assessments [36631 - 36637]  

######### 36631.  
The collection of the assessments levied pursuant to this part shall be made at the time and in the manner set forth by the city council in the resolution levying the assessment. Assessments levied on real property may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as for the ad valorem property tax, and may provide for the same lien priority and penalties for delinquent payment. All delinquent payments for assessments levied pursuant to this part may be charged interest and penalties.



######### 36632.  
(a) The assessments levied on real property pursuant to this part shall be levied on the basis of the estimated benefit to the real property within the property and business improvement district.  The city council may classify properties for purposes of determining the benefit to property of the improvements and activities provided pursuant to this part.

(b) Assessments levied on businesses pursuant to this part shall be levied on the basis of the estimated benefit to the businesses within the property and business improvement district.  The city council may classify businesses for purposes of determining the benefit to the businesses of the improvements and activities provided pursuant to this part.

(c) Properties zoned solely for residential use, or that are zoned for agricultural use, are conclusively presumed not to benefit from the improvements and service funded through these assessments, and shall not be subject to any assessment pursuant to this part.



######### 36633.  
The validity of an assessment levied under this part shall not be contested in an action or proceeding unless the action or proceeding is commenced within 30 days after the resolution levying the assessment is adopted pursuant to Section 36625. An appeal from a final judgment in an action or proceeding shall be perfected within 30 days after the entry of judgment.



######### 36634.  
The city council may execute baseline service contracts that would establish levels of city services that would continue after a property and business improvement district has been formed.



######### 36635.  
The owners’ association may, at any time, request that the city council modify the management district plan.  Any modification of the management district plan shall be made pursuant to this chapter.



######### 36636.  
(a) Upon the written request of the owners’ association, the city council may modify the management district plan after conducting one public hearing on the proposed modifications. The city council may modify the improvements and activities to be funded with the revenue derived from the levy of the assessments by adopting a resolution determining to make the modifications after holding a public hearing on the proposed modifications. If the modification includes the levy of a new or increased assessment, the city council shall comply with Section 36623. Notice of all other public hearings pursuant to this section shall comply with both of the following:

(1) The resolution of intention shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city once at least seven days before the public hearing.

(2) A complete copy of the resolution of intention shall be mailed by first class mail, at least 10 days before the public hearing, to each business owner or property owner affected by the proposed modification.

(b) The city council shall adopt a resolution of intention which states the proposed modification prior to the public hearing required by this section. The public hearing shall be held not more than 90 days after the adoption of the resolution of intention.



######### 36637.  
Any subsequent modification of the resolution shall be reflected in subsequent notices and maps recorded pursuant to Division 4.5 (commencing with Section 3100), in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 36627.








##### CHAPTER 3.5. Financing [36640- 36640.]  

######### 36640.  
(a)The city council may, by resolution, determine and declare that bonds shall be issued to finance the estimated cost of some or all of the proposed improvements described in the resolution of formation adopted pursuant to Section 36625, if the resolution of formation adopted pursuant to that section provides for the issuance of bonds, under the Improvement Bond Act of 1915 (Division 10 (commencing with Section 8500)) or in conjunction with Marks-Roos Local Bond Pooling Act of 1985 (Article 4 (commencing with Section 6584) of Chapter 5 of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code).  Either act, as the case may be, shall govern the proceedings relating to the issuance of bonds, although proceedings under the Bond Act of 1915 may be modified by the city council as necessary to accommodate assessments levied upon business pursuant to this part.

(b) The resolution adopted pursuant to subdivision (a) shall generally describe the proposed improvements specified in the resolution of formation adopted pursuant to Section 36625, set forth the estimated cost of those improvements, specify the number of annual installments and the fiscal years during which they are to be collected.  The amount of debt service to retire the bonds shall not exceed the amount of revenue estimated to be raised from assessments over 30 years.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, assessments levied to pay the principal and interest on any bond issued pursuant to this section shall not be reduced or terminated if doing so would interfere with the timely retirement of the debt.








##### CHAPTER 4. Governance [36650 - 36651]  

######### 36650.  
(a) The owners’ association shall cause to be prepared a report for each fiscal year, except the first year, for which assessments are to be levied and collected to pay the costs of the improvements, maintenance, and activities described in the report. The owners’ association’s first report shall be due after the first year of operation of the district. The report may propose changes, including, but not limited to, the boundaries of the property and business improvement district or any benefit zones within the district, the basis and method of levying the assessments, and any changes in the classification of property, including any categories of business, if a classification is used.

(2) The improvements, maintenance, and activities to be provided for that fiscal year.

(3) An estimate of the cost of providing the improvements, maintenance, and activities for that fiscal year.

(4) The method and basis of levying the assessment in sufficient detail to allow each real property or business owner, as appropriate, to estimate the amount of the assessment to be levied against his or her property or business for that fiscal year.

(5) The estimated amount of any surplus or deficit revenues to be carried over from a previous fiscal year.

(6) The estimated amount of any contributions to be made from sources other than assessments levied pursuant to this part.

The city council shall not approve a change in the basis and method of levying assessments that would impair an authorized or executed contract to be paid from the revenues derived from the levy of assessments, including any commitment to pay principal and interest on any bonds issued on behalf of the district.



######### 36651.  
The management district plan may, but is not required to, state that an owners’ association will provide the improvements, maintenance, and activities described in the management district plan. If the management district plan designates an owners’ association, the city shall contract with the designated nonprofit corporation to provide services.








##### CHAPTER 5. Renewal [36660- 36660.]  

######### 36660.  
(a) Any district previously established whose term has expired, or will expire, may be renewed by following the procedures for establishment as provided in this chapter.

(b) Upon renewal, any remaining revenues derived from the levy of assessments, or any revenues derived from the sale of assets acquired with the revenues, shall be transferred to the renewed district. If the renewed district includes additional parcels or businesses not included in the prior district, the remaining revenues shall be spent to benefit only the parcels or businesses in the prior district. If the renewed district does not include parcels or businesses included in the prior district, the remaining revenues attributable to these parcels shall be refunded to the owners of these parcels or businesses.

(c) Upon renewal, a district shall have a term not to exceed 10 years, or, if the district is authorized to issue bonds, until the maximum maturity of those bonds. There is no requirement that the boundaries, assessments, improvements, or activities of a renewed district be the same as the original or prior district.








##### CHAPTER 6. Disestablishment [36670 - 36671]  

######### 36670.  
(a) Any district established or extended pursuant to the provisions of this part, where there is no indebtedness, outstanding and unpaid, incurred to accomplish any of the purposes of the district, may be disestablished by resolution by the city council in either of the following circumstances:

(1) If the city council finds there has been misappropriation of funds, malfeasance, or a violation of law in connection with the management of the district, it shall notice a hearing on disestablishment.

(2) During the operation of the district, there shall be a 30-day period each year in which assessees may request disestablishment of the district. The first such period shall begin one year after the date of establishment of the district and shall continue for 30 days. The next such 30-day period shall begin two years after the date of the establishment of the district. Each successive year of operation of the district shall have such a 30-day period. Upon the written petition of the owners or authorized representatives of real property or the owners or authorized representatives of businesses in the district who pay 50 percent or more of the assessments levied, the city council shall pass a resolution of intention to disestablish the district. The city council shall notice a hearing on disestablishment.

(b) The city council shall adopt a resolution of intention to disestablish the district prior to the public hearing required by this section. The resolution shall state the reason for the disestablishment, shall state the time and place of the public hearing, and shall contain a proposal to dispose of any assets acquired with the revenues of the assessments levied within the property and business improvement district. The notice of the hearing on disestablishment required by this section shall be given by mail to the property owner of each parcel or to the owner of each business subject to assessment in the district, as appropriate. The city shall conduct the public hearing not less than 30 days after mailing the notice to the property or business owners. The public hearing shall be held not more than 60 days after the adoption of the resolution of intention.



######### 36671.  
(a) Upon the disestablishment or expiration without renewal of a district, any remaining revenues, after all outstanding debts are paid, derived from the levy of assessments, or derived from the sale of assets acquired with the revenues, or from bond reserve or construction funds, shall be refunded to the owners of the property or businesses then located and operating within the district in which assessments were levied by applying the same method and basis that was used to calculate the assessments levied in the fiscal year in which the district is disestablished or expires. All outstanding assessment revenue collected after disestablishment shall be spent on improvements and activities specified in the management district plan.

(b) If the disestablishment occurs before an assessment is levied for the fiscal year, the method and basis that was used to calculate the assessments levied in the immediate prior fiscal year shall be used to calculate the amount of any refund.






#### PART 8. MULTIFAMILY IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS [36700 - 36745]  


##### CHAPTER 1. General Provisions [36700 - 36705]  

######### 36700.  
This part shall be known and may be cited as the “Multifamily Improvement District Law.”



######### 36701.  
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) Many businesses that operate multifamily residential properties and commercial properties within predominantly multifamily neighborhoods of California’s communities are economically disadvantaged, are underutilized, and are unable to attract tenants because of inadequate facilities, services, and activities in those neighborhoods.

(b) It is in the public interest to promote the economic revitalization and physical maintenance of the multifamily residential neighborhoods to create jobs, attract new businesses, and prevent the erosion of the multifamily residential neighborhoods.

(c) It is of particular local benefit to allow cities to fund business related improvements and activities through the levy of assessments upon the businesses or real property that benefit from those improvements.

(d) Assessments levied for the purpose of providing improvements and promoting activities that benefit real property or businesses are not taxes for the general benefit of a city, but are assessments for the improvements and activities that confer special benefits upon the real property or businesses for which the improvements and activities are provided.



######### 36702.  
The purpose of this part is to supplement previously enacted provisions of law that authorize cities to levy assessments pursuant to the Parking and Business Improvement Area Law of 1989 (Part 6 (commencing with Section 36500)) and the Property and Business Improvement District Law of 1994 (Part 7 (commencing with Section 36600)).

(d) This part is intended to be construed liberally and, if any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

(e) Assessments levied under this part are not special taxes.

(f) Consistent with Article XIII C of the California Constitution, no assessment shall be imposed under this part on any property which exceeds the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit conferred on that property.
