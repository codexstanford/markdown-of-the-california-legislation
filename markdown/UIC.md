#### DIVISION 1. UNEMPLOYMENT AND DISABILITY COMPENSATION [100 - 4751]  

#### PART 1. UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION [100 - 2129]  

#### CHAPTER 1. General Provisions [100 - 144]  


##### ARTICLE 1. Policy and Interpretation [100 - 102]  

######### 100.  
As a guide to the interpretation and application of this division the public policy of this State is declared as follows:

Experience has shown that large numbers of the population of California do not enjoy permanent employment by reason of which their purchasing power is unstable.  This is detrimental to the interests of the people of California as a whole. 

The benefit to all persons resulting from public and private enterprise is realized in the final consumption of goods and services.  It is contrary to public policy to permit the supply of consumption goods and services at prices which do not provide against that harm to the population consequent upon periods of unemployment of those who contribute to the production and distribution of such goods and services.

Experience has shown that private charity and local relief cannot alone prevent the effects of unemployment.  Experience has shown that if the State awaits the coming of excessive unemployment it can neither create immediately the organization necessary to orderly, economical and effective relief nor bear the financial burden of relief without disrupting its whole system of ordinary revenues and without jeopardizing its credit.

The Legislature therefore declares that in its considered judgment the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of the State require the enactment of this measure under the police power of the State, for the compulsory setting aside of funds to be used for a system of unemployment insurance providing benefits for persons unemployed through no fault of their own, and to reduce involuntary unemployment and the suffering caused thereby to a minimum.   

It is the intent of the Legislature that unemployed persons claiming unemployment insurance benefits shall be required to make all reasonable effort to secure employment on their own behalf.



######### 101.  
This part is a part of a national plan of unemployment reserves and social security, and is enacted for the purpose of assisting in the stabilization of employment conditions. The imposition of the tax herein imposed upon California industry alone, without a corresponding tax being imposed upon all industry in the United States, would, by the corresponding penalty upon California industry, defeat the very purposes of this law as set forth in this article. Therefore when existing federal legislation which provides for a tax upon the payment of wages by employers in this State, against which all or any part of the employer contributions required under this part may be credited is repealed, amended, interpreted, affected or otherwise changed in such manner that no portion of such contributions may be thus credited, then upon the date of such change, the provisions of this part requiring employer contributions and providing for payment of unemployment compensation benefits shall cease to be operative and any assets in the Unemployment Fund or Unemployment Administration Fund shall in the discretion of the State Treasurer be held in the then existing depositaries or otherwise in the State Treasury. In the case of the Unemployment Administration Fund, such money may thereafter be dealt with by the State Treasurer pursuant to the conditions of the grant thereof to the State by the United States Government or agency thereof.



######### 102.  
All the rights, privileges or immunities conferred by this division or by acts deemed pursuant thereto shall exist subject to the power of the Legislature to amend or repeal this division at any time.

##### ARTICLE 4. Interstate and Federal Cooperation [451 - 456]  

######### 451.  
The administration of this division and of other state and federal unemployment compensation and public employment service laws will be promoted by cooperation between this State and such other states and the appropriate federal agencies in exchanging services, and making available facilities and information. The director may make investigations, secure and transmit information, make available services and facilities and exercise the other powers provided with respect to the administration of this division which he finds necessary or appropriate to facilitate the administration of any state or federal unemployment compensation or public employment service law, and may accept and utilize information, services and facilities made available to this State by an agency charged with the administration of any such other state or federal law.



######### 452.  
To the extent permissible under the laws and Constitution of the United States, the director may enter into or cooperate in arrangements whereby facilities and services provided under the unemployment compensation law of any foreign government, may be utilized for the taking of claims and the payment of benefits under the Unemployment Insurance Law of this State or a similar law of such government.



######### 453.  
To encourage cooperation between this state and other states in the enforcement of the unemployment insurance law of each state and to further coordinate the nationwide system of unemployment insurance in the United States and its territories:

(a) The courts of this state shall recognize and enforce liabilities for unemployment contributions, penalties, interest, and benefit overpayments imposed by other states which extend a like comity to this state.

(b) The Attorney General may commence action in any other jurisdiction by and in the name of the department to collect unemployment contributions, penalties, interest, and benefit overpayments legally due this state.  The officials of other states which extend a like comity to this state may sue for the collection of such contributions, penalties, interest, and benefit overpayments in the courts of this state.  A certificate by the Secretary of State under the Great Seal of the state that the officers of the department designated by the director have authority to collect the contributions, penalties, interest, and benefit overpayments is conclusive evidence of such authority.

(c) The Attorney General may commence action in this state as agent for and on behalf of any other state to enforce judgments and liabilities for unemployment insurance contributions, penalties, interest and benefit overpayments due such state which extends a like comity to this state.  The requesting state shall pay the court costs.



######### 454.  
The director may enter into reciprocal arrangements with authorized agencies of other states or of the Federal Government, or both, whereby:

(a) Services customarily performed in more than one state by an individual for a single employer shall be deemed to be services performed entirely within any one of the states (i) in which any part of the individual’s service is performed, or (ii) in which the individual has his residence, or (iii) in which the employer maintains a place of business, if there is in effect as to such services an election by the employing unit with the acquiescence of the individual, approved by the agency charged with the administration of such state’s unemployment compensation law pursuant to which all the services performed by such individual for such employer are deemed to be performed entirely within such state.

(b) Services on vessels engaged in interstate commerce wherever performed shall be deemed performed within this State or any other state on the basis of the location of the operating office of the employer from which the operations of the vessel are ordinarily and regularly supervised, managed, directed, and controlled.



######### 455.  
The director may enter into reciprocal arrangements with authorized agencies of other states or of the Federal Government, or both, whereby:

(a) Potential rights to benefits accumulated under the unemployment compensation laws of one or more states or of the Federal Government, or both, may constitute the basis for the payment of benefits through a single appropriate agency under terms which the director finds will be fair and reasonable to all affected interests and which will not result in any substantial loss to the fund.

(b) Wages or services in employment subject to an unemployment compensation law of another state or of the Federal Government shall be deemed to be wages in employment for employers for the purpose of determining an individual’s rights to unemployment compensation benefits under this part, and wages in employment for employers as defined in this part shall be deemed to be wages or services on the basis of which unemployment compensation under the law of another state or of the Federal Government is payable, but no such arrangement shall be entered into unless it contains provisions for reimbursements to the Unemployment Fund for such of the unemployment compensation benefits paid under this part upon the basis of such wages or services, and provisions for reimbursements from the Unemployment Fund for such of the compensation paid under such other law upon the basis of wages for employment as defined in this part as the director finds will be fair and reasonable to all affected interests.  Reimbursements paid from the Unemployment Fund pursuant to this subdivision shall be deemed to be unemployment compensation benefits for the purposes of this part.  The director may make to other state and federal agencies and receive from such other state or federal agencies reimbursements from or to the fund, in accordance with arrangements entered into pursuant to this subdivision.



######### 455.5.  
This state shall participate in any arrangements for the payment of compensation on the basis of combining an individual’s wages and employment covered under this division with his wages and employment covered under the unemployment compensation law of other states which are approved by the Secretary of Labor in consultation with the state unemployment compensation agencies as reasonably calculated to assure the prompt and full payment of compensation in such situations. Any such arrangement shall include provisions for both of the following:

(a) Applying the base period of a single state law to a claim involving the combining of an individual’s wages and employment covered under two or more state laws.

(b) Avoiding duplicate use of wages and employment by reason of such combining.



######### 455.7.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, benefits shall not be denied or reduced to an individual solely because he files a claim in another state, or a contiguous country with which the United States has an agreement with respect to unemployment compensation, or because he resides in another state or such a contiguous country at the time he files a claim for unemployment compensation.



######### 456.  
The director may enter into reciprocal arrangements with authorized agencies of other states or of the Federal Government, or both, whereby employer contributions due under this part with respect to wages for employment shall be deemed to have been paid to the Unemployment Fund of this State as of the date payment of such contributions was made under another state or federal unemployment compensation law. No arrangement shall be entered into pursuant to this section unless it contains provisions for such reimbursement to the fund of such contributions and the actual earnings thereon as the director finds will be fair and reasonable to all affected interests. The director may collect contributions in like manner for such agencies of other states and the Federal Government administering unemployment compensation laws and remit such contributions to such agencies under appropriate reciprocal arrangements.

The director may for good cause waive the requirement that a written application for termination shall be filed on or before the 31st day of January.  In no event shall the director approve any method of financing coverage by an election under Section 803 that would establish any different method of financing coverage for any calendar quarter where an election for coverage made by a nonprofit organization under Section 702.1 elects a method of financing coverage permitted under Section 803.  

(d) To the extent permitted by federal law, a nonprofit organization which elects reimbursement financing pursuant to this section and which has a favorable reserve account on the date the election takes effect shall not be liable for the reimbursement of benefits pursuant to the election to the extent that the cost of benefits does not exceed the amount in the reserve account.

The department shall make this determination when the entity or agent fails to respond timely or adequately in two instances relating to the individual claim for unemployment compensation benefits. This subdivision shall apply to benefit overpayments established on or after October 22, 2013.

The estimates may be made upon the basis of statistical sampling, or any other method as may be determined by the director.

Upon making that determination, the director shall give notice of the determination, pursuant to Section 1206, to the entity. The director may cancel any contributions or portion thereof that he or she finds has been erroneously determined.

The director shall charge to any special fund, that is responsible for the salary of any employee of an entity, the amount determined by the director for which the fund is liable pursuant to this section.

If the entity fails to pay the contributions required on or before the delinquency date, the director may assess the entity for the amount required by the notice of determination.

After a termination, the Indian tribe may again make an election pursuant to this section, but only if it is not delinquent in the payment of contributions, bonds, advances, reimbursements, or applicable penalties or interest required under this code.

That liability may be charged against any remaining balance of a prior reserve account used by the entity pursuant to Section 712 or 713.

Whenever the unencumbered balance of interest deposited in or earned by the School Employees Fund, after deducting administrative expenses paid or encumbered, exceeds two million dollars ($2,000,000) as of the close of each fiscal year, the unencumbered balance shall be credited as of the close of that fiscal year to the account of each school employer which has a positive balance in the fund, in the proportion that each positive account balance bears to the total of all positive account balances.



######### 828.  
Each school employer shall be responsible for a quarterly local experience charge as set forth below, together with the charges or penalties set by the administrator for administrative indiscretions, including tardiness and error, as well as all costs for benefits and administration resulting from failure to properly cover an employee. The reimbursement for charges shall be delinquent 30 days from the date of notice and if not paid within the time required, the school employer shall pay a penalty of 10 percent of the unpaid amount, plus interest at the adjusted annual rate established pursuant to Section 19521 of the Revenue and Taxation Code from and after the date of delinquency until paid. The local experience charge to be levied against each school employer shall be computed as follows:


# Local Experience Charge

(a) The local experience charge rate shall be 10 percent for the first three complete fiscal years of participation in the School Employees Fund.

(b) The local experience charge rate for the fourth fiscal year, and each succeeding fiscal year, shall be determined by dividing the reserve balance at the end of the fiscal year which began 24 months prior to the fiscal year for which the rate is being calculated by the benefits paid for that same prior fiscal year.

The factor derived is the employer’s reserve ratio. If, as of the computation date, the school employer’s reserve ratio equals or exceeds that which appears on any line in column 1 of the following table, but is less than that which appears in column 2 of that table, the local experience charge rate shall be the figure appearing on that same line in column 3 of that table.


|(Column 1)|(Column 2)|(Column 3)|
|Line||Reserve Ratio|Rate|
|1 ........................ negative|to|1.00|15%|
|2 ........................ 1.00|to|2.00|10%|
|3 ........................ 2.00|to|3.00| 5%|
|4 ........................ 3.00|or|more| 0%|
(c) The rate determined in subdivision (a) or (b) shall be multiplied by the employer’s quarterly benefit charges to compute the local experience charges.

The administrator shall, not later than March 31 of each year, notify each school employer participating in the School Employees Fund of their local experience charge rate for the succeeding fiscal year.



######### 829.  
The total amount of the local experience charge computed for each school employer pursuant to Section 828 shall be the amount that the school employer, county superintendent of schools, or empowered entity shall, on behalf of the employers under that jurisdiction, reimburse the School Employees Fund in the State Treasury. However, this amount shall not exceed 1.7 percent of the actual annual wages paid by a school employer in the immediately preceding calendar year as indicated in the four quarterly reports to the department.



######### 831.  
There is hereby created a School Employer Advisory Committee of five persons. The committee shall consist of one person appointed by each of the following: the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, Association of School Administrators, California School Business Officials, and the California School Board Association.

All such members shall serve at the pleasure of the appointing power and their only compensation shall be per diem expenses for attending meetings, which shall be a cost of administration of the School Employees Fund. The advisory committee shall select a chairperson and meet at least semiannually with the administrator to consider and recommend improvements concerning the administration of this article.



######### 832.  
The administrator shall at least annually calculate, as of the close of and for the immediately preceding fiscal year, the experiences of school employers relative to usage of the Unemployment Fund. The calculations shall include tabulations on the experience of each school employer in relation to the expenditures from and the income to the School Employees Fund from the wages paid by the employer. All school employers shall be listed and ranked by ratio of use. The report shall contain comments and recommendations on improvements to the administration, enforcement, and financing of the provisions relative to this article. The report by the administrator on the above shall be made each year to the affected school employer and governing board thereof prior to March 31.

The administrator shall develop experience relationships on all benefits paid to employees via the School Employees Fund and on school employers’ experience related to use and exposure. Data shall relate to numbers of employees and types of programs and shall be calculated as of the close of and for the immediately preceding fiscal year. A report by the administrator on the above shall be made each year to the Legislature prior to March 31 containing comments and recommendations on improvement to administration, enforcement and financing of the provisions relative thereto.

######### 977.5.  
Whenever the balance in the Unemployment Fund on September 30 of any calendar year is less than 0.6 percent of the wages (as defined by Section 940) in employment, subject to this part, paid during the 12-month period ending on the computation date, employers shall pay into the Unemployment Fund contributions for the succeeding calendar year upon all wages with respect to employment at an emergency solvency surcharge rate.

######### 979.  
On or before January 10 of each calendar year, the director shall prepare a statement based on records of the department declaring which of the employer tax schedules contained in Section 977 shall be in effect for that calendar year and whether the emergency solvency surcharge pursuant to Section 977.5 shall be added.

(b) In determining the balance in the Unemployment Fund for the purpose of Sections 977 and 977.5, there shall also be excluded any estimated or other contributions not legally due and payable with respect to the final calendar quarter of the calendar year, except any payment of contributions made under Sections 976.5 and 1137 and except any payment of contributions by employers terminating business during any calendar quarter.



######### 980.5.

(a) The unreimbursed balance of all benefits paid from the Unemployment Fund to claimants when those benefits are based upon wages in employment under any type of coverage pursuant to which reimbursement of benefits is permitted or required in lieu of the contributions required of employers, whether or not the director has certified the benefits to the employer as due or payable.

(b) The unreimbursed balance of all benefits paid from the Unemployment Fund to claimants when, and to the extent that, the benefits are subject to reimbursement by the federal government under any federal law that requires or permits this state to pay benefits from the Unemployment Fund and provides for reimbursement by the federal government of all or part of those benefits.



######### 981.  
In determining wages in employment, for the purpose of Sections 977 and 977.5, there shall be excluded all wages paid in employment under any type of coverage pursuant to which reimbursement of benefits is permitted or required in lieu of the contributions required of employers.



######### 982.  
(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), no employer shall be eligible for a contribution rate of more or less than 3.4 percent for any rating period unless his or her reserve account has been subject to benefit charges during the period of 12 complete consecutive calendar quarters ending on the computation date for that rating period and he or she is qualified under Sections 977 and 977.5.

(b) No new employer shall be eligible for a contribution rate of more or less than 3.4 percent unless his or her reserve account has been subject to benefit charges during the period of 12 complete consecutive calendar months ending on the computation date and the new employer is qualified under Sections 977 and 977.5.

(c) For the purposes of this section “new employer” means any of the following:

(1) An employer who first qualifies as an employer after the 1969 calendar year, and whose account is continuously subject to benefit charges from the date of first chargeability, except that a successor employer under Section 1051 is not a new employer if the successor applies for or obtains the transfer of the reserve account or part thereof of a predecessor who is not a new employer.

(2) An employer whose entire reserve account has been transferred to a successor under Article 5 (commencing with Section 1051) of Chapter 4 of this part.

(3) An employer whose reserve account has been canceled pursuant to Section 1029.

(f) This section does not apply to an employer assigned the maximum rate pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 977.



######### 984.  
(a) (1) Each worker shall pay worker contributions at the rate determined by the director pursuant to this section with respect to wages, as defined by Sections 926, 927, and 985. On or before October 31 of each calendar year, the director shall prepare a statement, which shall be a public record, declaring the rate of worker contributions for the calendar year and shall notify promptly all employers of employees covered for disability insurance of the rate.

(2) (A) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the rate of worker contributions for calendar year 1987 and for each subsequent calendar year shall be 1.30 times the amount disbursed from the Disability Fund during the 12-month period ending September 30 and immediately preceding the calendar year for which the rate is to be effective, less the amount in the Disability Fund on that September 30, with the resulting figure divided by total wages paid pursuant to Sections 926, 927, and 985 during the same 12-month period, and then rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent.

(B) The director shall increase the rate of worker contributions by .08 percent for the 2004 and 2005 calendar years to cover the initial cost of family temporary disability insurance benefits provided in Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 3300) of Part 2.

(3) The rate of worker contributions shall not exceed 1.5 percent or be less than 0.1 percent. The rate of worker contributions shall not decrease from the rate in the previous year by more than two-tenths of 1 percent.

(b) Worker contributions required under Sections 708 and 708.5 shall be at a rate determined by the director to reimburse the Disability Fund for unemployment compensation disability benefits paid and estimated to be paid to all employers and self-employed individuals covered by those sections. On or before November 30th of each calendar year, the director shall prepare a statement, which shall be a public record, declaring the rate of contributions for the succeeding calendar year for all employers and self-employed individuals covered under Sections 708 and 708.5 and shall notify promptly the employers and self-employed individuals of the rate. The rate shall be determined by dividing the estimated benefits and administrative costs paid in the prior year by the product of the annual remuneration deemed to have been received under Sections 708 and 708.5 and the estimated number of persons who were covered at any time in the prior year. The resulting rate shall be rounded to the next higher one-hundredth percentage point. The rate may also be reduced or increased by a factor estimated to maintain as nearly as practicable a cumulative zero balance in the funds contributed pursuant to Sections 708 and 708.5. Estimates made pursuant to this subdivision may be made on the basis of statistical sampling, or another method determined by the director.

(c) The director’s action in determining a rate under this section shall not constitute an authorized regulation.

(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), and except as provided in paragraph (2), the director may, at the director’s discretion, increase or decrease, by not to exceed 0.1 percent, the rate of worker contributions determined pursuant to subdivision (a), up to a maximum worker contribution rate of 1.5 percent, if the director determines the adjustment is necessary to reimburse the Disability Fund for disability benefits paid or estimated to be paid to individuals covered by this section or to prevent the accumulation of funds in excess of those needed to maintain an adequate fund balance.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), for the 2004, 2005, and 2006 calendar years, the director may not decrease the rate of worker contributions, regardless of whether the director determines that a decrease is necessary to prevent the accumulation of funds in excess of those needed to maintain the adequacy of the Disability Fund during program implementation.

(e) The amendment to this section by the act adding this subdivision shall become operative on July 1, 2019.



######### 984.5.  
(a) Effective January 1, 1994, the director shall prepare a statement on or before November 30 of each calendar year, which shall be a public record, declaring the rate of contributions of the succeeding calendar year for all employers and self-employed individuals covered under Section 708 or 708.5 and shall notify promptly the employers and self-employed individuals of the rate. For calendar years 1994 to 1996, inclusive, worker contributions required under Section 708 or 708.5 shall be at a rate determined by the director to reimburse the Disability Fund for the sum of estimated administrative costs due to those sections and unemployment compensation disability benefits estimated to be paid to all employers and self-employed individuals covered by those sections. The rate shall be determined by dividing the sum of the benefits expected to be paid in the following calendar year and the administrative costs expected to be incurred under Section 708 or 708.5 during that calendar year by earnings estimated to be reported under those sections for that same calendar year. The resulting rate shall be rounded to the next higher one-hundredth percentage point. This rate may also be reduced or increased by a factor estimated to maintain as nearly as practicable a cumulative zero balance in funds contributed pursuant to Section 708 or 708.5.

For calendar year 1997, and each calendar year thereafter, the rate established each November 30 shall be determined by multiplying the current year’s rate by the ratio of 1.10 times the current year disbursements divided by contributions for the same period, under Sections 708 and 708.5. If in any calendar year the cumulative balance of contributions minus disbursements equals or exceeds 20 percent of annual disbursements, the contribution rate for the succeeding year shall be adjusted to a level necessary to maintain revenues at no more than 20 percent over annual disbursements. If legislation is enacted necessitating adjustments in the benefit levels for employers and self-employed individuals covered under Section 708 or 708.5, the rate may be adjusted by a factor estimated to provide that funds contributed pursuant to Section 708 or 708.5 cover disbursements pursuant to these sections.

For the purpose of this subdivision, disbursements are defined as the sum of unemployment compensation disability benefits paid to employers and self-employed individuals covered under Section 708 or 708.5, plus administrative costs related to those sections. Estimates made pursuant to this subdivision shall be available for public inspection.

(b)  The director’s action in determining a rate under this section shall not constitute an authorized regulation.



######### 985.  
(a) Section 984 shall not apply to that part of the remuneration which, after remuneration with respect to employment equal to four times the maximum weekly benefit for each calendar year specified in Section 2655 multiplied by 13 and divided by 55 percent has been paid to an individual by an employer, is paid to the individual by the employer.

(b) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2024, and as of that date is repealed.



######### 986.  
(a) Notwithstanding any provision of law in this state to the contrary, each employer shall:

(1) Except as provided in subdivision (a)(2) of this section, withhold in trust the amount of his workers’ contributions from their wages at the time the wages are paid, shall show the deduction on his payroll records, and shall furnish each worker with a statement in writing showing the amount which has been deducted, in such form and at such times as may be prescribed.

(2) Hold in trust the amount of his workers’ contributions, at the time their wages are paid, where he undertakes or agrees to pay without deduction from the wages of his workers the amount of worker contributions required of his workers under this division.

(b) Each employer shall transmit all such contributions withheld or held in trust to the department for the Disability Fund, in addition to his own contributions for the Unemployment Fund, pursuant to authorized regulations.



######### 987.  
Each employer shall be liable for any and all contributions required to be made by his workers on account of wages which he has paid to them regardless of whether or not he has deducted the contributions from the workers’ wages at the time they were paid, but no employer shall be liable for worker contributions required on behalf of himself or of any of his employees with respect to wages paid while there is in effect at the time the wages were paid a rule or regulation or interpretation of the director or of the department that such wages were not subject to such contributions.



######### 987.7.  
(a) If the worker contributions required in any one month to be made because of the receipt of cash tips and cash gratuities exceed the wages of the worker under the control of the employer, the worker may furnish the employer, on or before the 10th day of the following month, or, if the amounts are estimated, on or before the last day of the month following the calendar quarter, an amount equal to the excess.

(b) If the worker contributions required by Section 984 with respect to cash tips and cash gratuities exceed the amount of worker contributions that can be collected by the employer from the wages of the worker, the excess shall be paid by the worker, except as provided by Section 1088.6. The worker shall pay the excess to the department within 30 days from his or her receipt of the written statement furnished by his or her employer pursuant to Section 1088.6. If the worker fails to pay the excess within the time required by this subdivision, the director may make an assessment for the excess and shall give the worker a written notice of the assessment. Article 8 (commencing with Section 1126) with respect to the assessment of contributions and Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 1701) with respect to the collection of contributions shall apply to the recovery of amounts under this subdivision.

(c) The director may offset amounts assessed pursuant to subdivision (b) against any refund payable to the worker under Section 1176.5 or against any amount of disability benefits to which he or she may become entitled under Part 2 (commencing with Section 2601) within any of the following periods:

(1) The current disability benefit period.

(2) One year from the beginning date of any disability benefit period that begins during the three-year period next succeeding the service of notice of the assessment.



######### 988.  
In case of the insolvency or bankruptcy of an employer, contributions by workers, payable as provided in this article, shall not be considered any part of the employer’s assets and shall be paid to the director prior to the payment of any other claim against the employer.



######### 989.  
The annual tax rate or contribution rate which under this division is determined to apply to any particular employee or any particular employer, or group of employees or group of employers, shall be made public and available for public inspection but in no case shall the amount of tax paid by any employee or employer, or group of employees or group of employers, be disclosed to the public.



######### 990.  
In the payment of any contributions, a fractional part of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent ($0.005) or more, in which case it shall be increased to one cent ($0.01).



######### 991.  
(a) Any contributions paid to the Unemployment Fund or Disability Fund either with respect to wages on which contributions previously have been paid in error and without negligence on the part of the employing unit to another state having an unemployment compensation law, or with respect to wages on which contributions computed under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act previously have been paid in error and without negligence on the part of the employing unit to an agency of the federal government, shall be deemed for the purposes of this division to have been paid to the department at the time of the erroneous payment to the other state or to the federal agency, if payment is made to the department by the employing unit within 30 days after the employing unit is given notice pursuant to Section 1206 by the director of the determination that payment shall be made to the department. The 30-day period for payment may be extended by the director for good cause for a period not to exceed an additional 90 days.

(b) Any contributions paid to the Unemployment Fund or Disability Fund with respect to wages on which contributions computed under this division previously have been paid in error and without negligence on the part of the employing unit to an admitted disability insurer, to trustees administering a voluntary plan for the employing unit, to a self-insured plan of the employing unit, to another agency of this state, or to an agency of the federal government shall be deemed, solely to the extent of the amount of contributions previously paid in error and without negligence, for the purposes of this division to have been paid to the department at the time of the erroneous payment to the admitted disability insurer, to trustees administering a voluntary plan for the employing unit, to a self-insured plan of the employing unit, to another agency of this state, or to the federal agency, if payment is made to the department by the employing unit within 30 days after the employing unit is given notice pursuant to Section 1206 by the director of the determination that payment shall be made to the department. The 30-day period for payment may be extended by the director for good cause for a period not to exceed an additional 90 days. As used in this subdivision “paid” includes credits made to a self-insured plan of the employing unit. With respect to payments by an employing unit to an admitted disability insurer, to trustees administering a voluntary plan for the employing unit, or to a self-insured plan of the employing unit, this subdivision shall apply only if one or more of the following conditions are met:

(1) At the time of payment the employing unit has or prior to the time of payment had an approved voluntary plan with the recipient of the payment.

(2) Prior to the time of payment the employing unit had applied to the department for a voluntary plan which was subsequently approved by the department.

(3) At the time of payment the employing unit is a subsidiary or affiliate of an employing unit having an approved voluntary plan.

(b) This section shall become inoperative on January 1, 2021, unless the director determines that noncharging provisions are otherwise extended by federal law. 



######### 1027.1.  
On the computation date in 1966, the portion of each negative reserve balance which has not previously been charged to the balancing account shall be transferred to that account and the employer’s reserve account thereupon canceled. The computation on such date for calendar year 1967 shall be based upon the status of the employer’s account prior to such transfer and cancellation subject to the requirements of Section 982. The computation for each calendar year beginning with calendar year 1968 shall be in accordance with the requirements of Section 982 and an employer whose reserve account has been canceled under this section shall be considered as first becoming a subject employer on July 1, 1966.



######### 1027.5.  
On the computation date each year, the amount each employer’s net balance of reserve is more negative than 21 percent of the employer’s average base payroll shall be canceled from his or her reserve balance.

(b) Whenever a period of three consecutive years has elapsed, commencing with the effective date of an election by any entity to finance benefits pursuant to Section 803, any portion of the reserve account of the entity that has not been subject to use pursuant to Section 712 or 713, unless that portion has been reacquired by the entity by termination of the election under Section 803 prior to the expiration of the three-year period, shall be canceled on the records of the department. Section 982 shall apply to that entity.

(c) Upon the termination of an election by a school employer to finance benefits pursuant to Article 6 (commencing with Section 821) of Chapter 3, any favorable balance in the account of the school employer under the election shall be canceled on the records of the department.

(6) The claimant left the employer’s employ to take a substantially better job.

The period during which the employer may submit these facts may be extended by the director for good cause.

######### 1030.1.

A plea or verdict of guilty irrespective of whether an order granting probation or other order is made suspending the imposition of the sentence or whether sentence is imposed but execution thereof is suspended, or a conviction following a plea of nolo contendere, is deemed to be a conviction within the meaning of this section.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, any ruling made prior to a conviction or other final disposition of the criminal complaint or accusation by the court as to whether an individual who is terminated due to his absence from work because of incarceration voluntarily leaves without good cause may, if no appeal has been taken from the ruling, for good cause be reconsidered by the department during the benefit year or extended duration period or extended benefit period to which the ruling relates. Notice of any reconsidered ruling shall be given to the employer which received notice under Section 1030 or 3701 or 4701, and the employer may appeal therefrom in the manner prescribed in Section 1328 or 3655 or 4655.

(b) The department shall consider facts submitted under subdivision (a) of this section together with any information in its possession and promptly notify the employer of its ruling. If the department finds that an individual is, under Section 1252, unemployed in any week on the basis of the individual having less than full-time work, and that the employer submitting facts under this section is a base period employer for whom the individual has continuously, commencing in or prior to the beginning of the base period, rendered services in such less than full-time work, that employer’s account shall not be charged, except as provided by Section 1026 or if the department determines pursuant to Section 1026.1 that the employer’s reserve account should not be credited, for benefits paid the individual in any week in which such wages are payable by that employer to the individual. The employer may appeal from a ruling or reconsidered ruling to an administrative law judge within 30 days after service of notice of the ruling or reconsidered ruling. The 30-day period may be extended for good cause, which shall include, but not be limited to, mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.

(a) The employer, within 60 days after the date of mailing of any statement of charges or credits and charges to the reserve account, or within an additional period not exceeding 60 days which may for good cause be granted by the director, may file with the director a written protest on any item shown thereon. The protest shall set forth the specific grounds on which it is made. No protest may be made on the ground that a claimant was ineligible for a benefit payment where the employer was notified as required by this division and any authorized regulation of the filing of a claim for the benefits or of a determination of the claimant’s eligibility therefor and the employer failed to file a timely appeal on the benefit claim, or a final decision of an administrative law judge or of the appeals board affirmed the payment of the benefits. Except as to corrections made by the director as provided in Section 1036, the contribution rate and other items shown on any such statement of charges or statement of account shall be final unless a protest is filed within the time prescribed in this section.

(b) The employer, within 30 days after the last working day of March, may file a protest on the grounds that the director did not allow voluntary unemployment insurance contributions to the reserve account in accordance with Section 976.5.

Except in the case where fraud, intent to evade, misrepresentation, or willful nondisclosure is found, the notice of correction shall be issued prior to the expiration of the rating period to which a statement relates.

(b) Any additional amount of contributions resulting from an increased contribution rate caused by the correction of any error that the director finds in any statement of reserve account or statement of charges shall be assessed within 180 days from the postmarked date of the notice of correction. These assessments shall be issued in accordance with Article 8 (commencing with Section 1126). However, these assessments shall become final on the last day of the calendar month following the calendar quarter in which the assessment is issued.

(c) Any overpaid amount of contributions resulting from a reduced rate caused by the correction of an error that the director finds on any statement of reserve account or statement of charges shall be refunded within 180 days of the postmarked date of the notice of correction. These refunds shall be issued in accordance with Article 9 (commencing with Section 1176).



######### 1037.  
If a protest involving the contribution rate is pending when any contribution to which such rate relates is due, the employer shall pay the contribution at the rate shown in the statement furnished by the director. Such a protest, however, shall constitute a claim for refund under Article 9 of this chapter, and if a final determination on the protest reduces the contribution rate the amount of overpayment shall be promptly credited or refunded as provided in that article.

The provisions of this article requiring a specific application for transfer of reserve account shall not apply to any successor who through error or inadvertence continued to file contribution reports and pay contributions for the account and at the rate determined by the department to apply to the predecessor employer, but such reporting and payment shall be deemed to be in lieu of the application and shall be given the same effect as though a specific application had been filed during the 90-day period beginning with the date of acquisition.

In the event of a denial or granting of an application for transfer of reserve account, the director shall give notice pursuant to Section 1206 to the employing unit making such application, and to the predecessor employing unit to whose reserve account the application relates, if such predecessor employing unit has continued in business as an employer.

Upon dissolution of a joint venture each participating employer may within 90 days apply for the transfer of his proportionate share of the reserve account. Upon receipt of the application the separate account, actual contribution and benefit experience and pay rolls of such joint venture shall be apportioned among the employers making such application in the same proportion that assets are distributed among the participating employers, and the portion thereof of each shall be transferred to each such employer for the purpose of determining its rate of contribution after the dissolution with the same effect for such purpose as if the applicable portion of the operations of such joint venture had at all times been carried on by such employer. Such portion of such separate account shall be transferred by the director to each such employer and as of the date of such dissolution shall become the separate account or part of the separate account, as the case may be, of such employer.

An entity or organization shall be deemed to have made a bona fide claim that it is a church or religious entity for purposes of this section if either of the following is established:

(1) That it has been recognized as a church or religious organization by any entity of state or federal government.

(2) That the appeals board found that the department has failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence admitted at the proceedings to determine tax liability that the petitioner has not made a bona fide claim of coverage under subdivision (a) as a church or religious entity.

(c) A petition for writ of mandate shall lie to challenge any decision denying eligibility under subdivision (b), and shall not be deemed an action proscribed by or within the meaning of Section 32 of Article XIII of the California Constitution or Section 1851.

######### 1242.  
If, in any action authorized by Section 1241, judgment is rendered for the plaintiff, the amount of the judgment shall first be credited on any contributions, interest, and penalties due from the plaintiff under this division, and the balance of the judgment shall be refunded to the plaintiff. In any such judgment, interest shall be allowed and paid only to the extent that interest and penalties collected under this division are available therefor, at the rate of 12 percent per annum upon the amount of contributions found to have been illegally collected from the date of the payment of the contributions to the date of the judgment.

A decision of the appeals board on an appeal from a denial of a protest under Section 1034 or on an appeal from a denial or granting of an application for transfer of reserve account under Article 5 (commencing with Section 1051) shall be subject to judicial review if an appropriate proceeding is filed by the employer within 90 days of the service of notice of the decision. The director may, in writing, extend for a period of not exceeding two years the time within which such proceeding may be instituted if written request for such extension is filed with the director within the 90-day period.

If an individual restricts his or her availability to part-time work, he or she may be considered to be able to work and available for work pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 1253 if it is determined that all of following conditions exist:

(a) The claim is based on the part-time employment.

(b) The claimant is actively seeking and is willing to accept work under essentially the same conditions as existed while the wage credits were accrued.

(c) The claimant imposes no other restrictions and is in a labor market in which a reasonable demand exists for the part-time services he or she offers.



######### 1253.9.  
An unemployed individual may not be disqualified for unemployment compensation benefits solely on the basis that he or she is a student.  An unemployed individual may be considered to be able and available for work pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 1253, if the school attendance does not eliminate a substantial portion of the individual’s full-time labor market availability.  If an unemployed individual restricts his or her availability to part-time work due to school attendance, he or she may be considered to be able to work and available for work if he or she meets the criteria set forth in Section 1253.8.



######### 1253.92.  
(a) An unemployed individual who meets all of the requirements under this division, including Section 1253.9, and certifies for continued unemployment compensation benefits shall not be scheduled for a determination of eligibility for a week in which the individual commenced or is participating in a training or education program and has notified the department of the training or education program.

(b) If the department determines that the commencement of, or the ongoing participation in, a training or education program conflicts with the eligibility requirements for unemployment compensation under this division, the department may schedule and conduct a determination of eligibility.



######### 1254.  
No week shall be counted as a week of unemployment under subdivision (d) of Section 1253:

(a) Unless it occurs within the benefit year which includes the week with respect to which he claims payment of unemployment compensation benefits, but this requirement shall not interrupt the payment of such benefits for consecutive weeks of unemployment.  The week immediately preceding a benefit year, if part of one uninterrupted period of unemployment which continues into that benefit year shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section only, to be within such benefit year as well as within the preceding benefit year.

(b) If unemployment compensation benefits have been paid with respect to that week.

(c) Unless the individual was eligible for unemployment compensation benefits with respect thereto in all respects, except for the requirements of subdivision (d) of Section 1253 and Section 1281.



######### 1255.  
An individual is not eligible for unemployment compensation benefits on account of unemployment for any week or part of any week with respect to which he has received or is seeking unemployment benefits under an unemployment compensation law of any other state or of the United States. If the appropriate agency of the other state or of the United States finally determines that he is not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits, this section shall not apply.



######### 1255.3.  
(a) Except as provided by subdivisions (c) and (d), the amount of unemployment compensation benefits, extended duration benefits, and federal-state extended benefits payable to an individual for any week which begins after March 31, 1980, and which begins in a period with respect to which that individual is receiving a governmental or other pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or any other similar periodic payment which is based on the previous work of the individual shall be reduced, but not below zero, by an amount equal to the amount of the pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other payment, which is reasonably attributable to that week.

(b) Subdivision (a) shall be operative only during such time as Section 3304 of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act requires that state unemployment insurance laws contain those provisions as a condition of certification of state unemployment insurance laws by the Secretary of Labor.

(c) Subdivision (a) shall apply to any pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other similar periodic payment only if both of the following are met:   

(1) The pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or similar payment is under a plan maintained (or contributed to) by a base period or chargeable employer.

(2) In the case of such a payment not made under the federal Social Security Act or the federal Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (or the corresponding provisions of prior law), services performed for the employer by the individual after the beginning of the base period (or remuneration for such services) affect eligibility for, or increase the amount of, such pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or similar periodic payment.

(d) (1) Subdivision (a) shall not apply to any pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity or other similar periodic payment if the individual has made any contribution to the pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other similar periodic payment.

(2) The amendments made to this subdivision during the 1986 portion of the 1985–86 Regular Session shall apply to new claims filed with an effective date beginning on or after January 1, 1987.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, an individual who is ineligible to receive unemployment compensation benefits or extended duration benefits under subdivision (a) of this section for one or more days of a week of unemployment and who is eligible to receive unemployment compensation benefits or extended duration benefits for the other days of that week is, with respect to that week, entitled to an amount of unemployment compensation benefits or extended duration benefits computed by reducing his weekly benefit amount by the amount of temporary total disability indemnity received for that week.

(c) The amount determined under subdivision (a) or (b), if not a multiple of one dollar ($1), shall be computed to the next higher multiple of one dollar ($1).



######### 1255.7.  
(a) The Department of Child Support Services shall notify the director whether an individual filing a claim for unemployment compensation after October 1, 1982, owes support obligations as defined under subdivision (h), and notify the department of any changes in the status of these individuals to ensure that the department has a current record.

(b) The department shall maintain and keep current a record of individuals who owe support obligations and who may have claims for unemployment compensation benefits.

(g) This section applies only if appropriate arrangements have been made for reimbursement by the Department of Child Support Services for the administrative costs incurred by the Employment Development Department.

(h) For purposes of this section, “support obligations” means the child and related spousal support obligations which are being enforced pursuant to a plan described in Section 454 of the Social Security Act and as that section may hereafter be amended.  However, to the extent “related spousal support obligations” may not be collected from unemployment compensation under federal law, those obligations shall not be included in the definition of support obligations under this section.



######### 1256.  
An individual is disqualified for unemployment compensation benefits if the director finds that he or she left his or her most recent work voluntarily without good cause or that he or she has been discharged for misconduct connected with his or her most recent work.

An individual is presumed to have been discharged for reasons other than misconduct in connection with his or her work and not to have voluntarily left his or her work without good cause unless his or her employer has given written notice to the contrary to the department as provided in Section 1327, setting forth facts sufficient to overcome the presumption. The presumption provided by this section is rebuttable.

An individual whose employment is terminated under the compulsory retirement provisions of a collective bargaining agreement to which the employer is a party, shall not be deemed to have left his or her work without good cause.

An individual may be deemed to have left his or her most recent work with good cause if he or she leaves employment to accompany his or her spouse or domestic partner to a place or to join him or her at a place from which it is impractical to commute to the employment. For purposes of this section “spouse” includes a person to whom marriage is imminent, and “domestic partner” includes a person to whom a domestic partnership, as described in Section 297 of the Family Code, is imminent.

An individual may be deemed to have left his or her most recent work with good cause if he or she leaves employment to protect his or her family, or himself or herself, from domestic violence abuse.

An individual shall be deemed to have left his or her most recent work with good cause if he or she elects to be laid off in place of an employee with less seniority pursuant to a provision in a collective bargaining agreement that provides that an employee with more seniority may elect to be laid off in place of an employee with less seniority when the employer has decided to lay off employees.



######### 1256.1.  
(a) If the employment of an individual is terminated due to his absence from work for a period in excess of 24 hours because of his incarceration and he is convicted of the offense for which he was incarcerated or of any lesser included offense, he shall be deemed to have left his work voluntarily without good cause for the purposes of Section 1256.  A plea or verdict of guilty, or a conviction following a plea of nolo contendere, is deemed to be a conviction within the meaning of this section irrespective of whether an order granting probation or other order is made suspending the imposition of the sentence or whether sentence is imposed but execution thereof is suspended.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, any determination made prior to a conviction or other final disposition of the criminal complaint or accusation by the court as to whether an individual who is terminated due to his absence from work because of incarceration voluntarily leaves without good cause may, if no appeal has been taken from the determination, for good cause be reconsidered by the department during the benefit year or extended duration period to which the determination relates. Notice of any reconsidered determination shall be given to the claimant and any employer or employing unit which received notice under Section 1328 or 1331, and the claimant or employer may appeal therefrom in the manner prescribed in Section 1328.



######### 1256.2.  
(a) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b), an individual who terminates his or her employment shall not be deemed to have left his or her most recent work without good cause if his or her employer deprived the individual of equal employment opportunities on any basis listed in subdivision (a) of Section 12940 of the Government Code, as those bases are defined in Sections 12926 and 12926.1 of the Government Code.

(b) Subdivision (a) does not apply to the following:

(1) A deprivation of equal employment opportunities that is based upon a bona fide occupational qualification or applicable security regulations established by the United States or this state, specifically, as provided in Section 12940 of the Government Code.

(2) An individual who fails to make reasonable efforts to provide the employer with an opportunity to remove any unintentional deprivation of the individual’s equal employment opportunities.



######### 1256.3.  
For the purposes of Sections 1256, 1256.1, 1256.2, 1256.4, and 1256.5, “most recent work” is that work in which a claimant last performed compensated services:

(a) Prior to and nearest the date of filing a valid new, reopened, or additional claim for unemployment compensation benefits, a valid primary, reopened, or additional claim for extended duration benefits, or a valid application, or reopened or additional claim for federal-state extended benefits.

(b) During the calendar week for which a continued claim is filed.



######### 1256.4.  
(a) An individual is disqualified for unemployment compensation benefits if either of the following occur:

(1) The director finds that he or she was discharged from his or her most recent work for chronic absenteeism due to intoxication or reporting to work while intoxicated or using intoxicants on the job, or gross neglect of duty while intoxicated, when any of these incidents is caused by an irresistible compulsion to use or consume intoxicants, including alcoholic beverages.

(2) He or she otherwise left his or her most recent employment for reasons caused by an irresistible compulsion to use or consume intoxicants, including alcoholic beverages.

(b) An individual disqualified under this section, under a determination transmitted to him or her by the department, is ineligible to receive unemployment compensation benefits under this part for the week in which the separation occurs, and continuing until he or she has performed service in bona fide employment for which remuneration is received equal to or in excess of five times his or her weekly benefit amount, or until a physician or authorized treatment program administrator certifies that the individual has entered into and is continuing in, or has completed, a treatment program for his or her condition and is able to return to employment.

(c) The department shall advise each individual disqualified under this section of the benefits available under Part 2 (commencing with Section 2601), and, if assistance in locating an appropriate treatment program is requested, refer the individual to the appropriate county drug or alcohol program administrator.



######### 1256.5.  
(a) An individual shall be deemed to have left his or her most recent work with good cause if the director finds that he or she leaves employment because of sexual harassment if the individual has taken reasonable steps to preserve the working relationship. No steps shall be required if the director finds it would have been futile. For purposes of this subdivision, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when any of the following occur:

(1) Submission to the conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment.

(2) Submission to or rejection of the conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the individual.

(3) The conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.

(b) Findings of fact and law by the director shall not collaterally estop adjudication of the issue of sexual harassment in another forum.



######### 1257.  
An individual is also disqualified for unemployment compensation benefits if:

(a) He or she willfully, for the purpose of obtaining unemployment compensation benefits, either made a false statement or representation,  including, but not limited to, using a false name, false social security number, or other false identification, with actual knowledge of the falsity thereof, or withheld a material fact in order to obtain any unemployment compensation benefits under this division.

(b) He or she, without good cause, refused to accept suitable employment when offered to him or her, or failed to apply for suitable employment when notified by a public employment office.



######### 1258.  
“Suitable employment” means work in the individual’s usual occupation or for which he is reasonably fitted, regardless of whether or not it is subject to this division.

In determining whether the work is work for which the individual is reasonably fitted, the director shall consider the degree of risk involved to the individual’s health, safety, and morals, his physical fitness and prior training, his experience and prior earnings, his length of unemployment and prospects for securing local work in his customary occupation, and the distance of the available work from his residence, and such other factors as would influence a reasonably prudent person in the individual’s circumstances.



######### 1258.5.  
“Suitable employment” does not include employment with an employer who does not:

(a) Possess an appropriate state license to engage in his business, trade, or profession; or

(b) Withhold or hold in trust the employee contributions required by Part 2 (commencing with Section 2601) of this division for unemployment compensation disability benefits and does not transmit all such employee contributions to the department for the Disability Fund as required by Section 986; or

######### 1259.  
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this division, no work or employment shall be deemed suitable and benefits shall not be denied to any otherwise eligible and qualified individual for refusing new work under any of the following conditions:

(a) If the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute.

(b) If the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality.

(c) If, as a condition of being employed, the individual would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization.

(d) If the offer of employment is from an employer who does not possess an appropriate state license to engage in his business, trade, or profession if required by state law.

(e) If the offer of employment is from an employer who does not carry either workmen’s compensation insurance or possess a certificate of self-insurance as required by Division 4 (commencing with Section 3201) of the Labor Code.

(f) If the offer of employment is from an employer who does not withhold or hold in trust the employee contributions required by Part 2 (commencing with Section 2601) of this division for unemployment compensation disability benefits and does not transmit all such employee contributions to the department for the Disability Fund as required by Section 986.



######### 1260.  
(a) An individual disqualified under Section 1256, under a determination transmitted to the individual by the department, is ineligible to receive unemployment compensation benefits for the week in which the act that causes the disqualification occurs and continuing until they have, subsequent to the act that causes disqualification and their registration for work, performed service in bona fide employment for which remuneration is received equal to or in excess of five times their weekly benefit amount.

(b) An individual disqualified under subdivision (b) of Section 1257, under a determination transmitted to the individual by the department, is ineligible to receive unemployment compensation benefits for not less than 2 and no more than 10 consecutive weeks beginning with:

(c) An individual disqualified under subdivision (a) of Section 1257, under a determination transmitted to the individual by the department, and who was not paid any benefit amount as a result of their false statement or representation, is ineligible to receive unemployment compensation benefits for two weeks commencing with the week in which the determination is served upon them, or any subsequent week, for which they are first otherwise in all respects eligible for unemployment compensation benefits and for not more than 13 subsequent weeks for which they are otherwise in all respects eligible for unemployment compensation benefits.

This subdivision shall not apply to an individual convicted under Section 2101.

(d) An individual disqualified under subdivision (a) of Section 1257, under a determination transmitted to the individual by the department, and who was paid any benefit amount as a result of their false statement or representation, is ineligible to receive unemployment compensation benefits for five weeks commencing with the week in which the determination is served upon them, or any subsequent week, for which they are first otherwise in all respects eligible for unemployment compensation benefits and for not more than 10 subsequent weeks for which they are otherwise in all respects eligible for unemployment compensation benefits. No disqualification under this subdivision shall be applied to any week if all or any portion of the week is beyond the three-year period next succeeding the date of the service of the determination. This subdivision shall not apply to an individual convicted under Section 2101.

(e) Notwithstanding subdivision (c) or (d), an individual who is subject to a disqualification that is imposed under subdivision (b) of Section 1257 may, if they are otherwise in all respects eligible for unemployment compensation benefits, concurrently serve a disqualification imposed under subdivision (a) of Section 1257.

(A) The number of weeks for which the individual is ineligible for benefits pursuant to subdivision (c) or (d).

This section shall not be construed to authorize cancellation of wage credits or total reduction of benefit rights for any cause whatsoever, nor shall it limit or affect any other section that provides for cancellation of wage credits or total reduction of benefit rights for any cause permitted under this section.



######### 1261.  
When successive disqualifications under Section 1257 occur, the director may extend the period of ineligibility provided for in Section 1260 for an additional period not to exceed eight additional weeks. With regard to successive disqualifications pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1257, the department is required to have complied with subdivision (f) of Section 1260 for each successive disqualification.



######### 1262.  
An individual is not eligible for unemployment compensation benefits, and these benefits shall not be payable to him or her, if the individual left his or her work because of a trade dispute. The individual shall remain ineligible for the period during which he or she continues out of work by reason of the fact that the trade dispute is still in active progress in the establishment in which he or she was employed.



######### 1262.5.  
Whenever the department learns that a trade dispute is in progress, the department shall promptly conduct an investigation and make investigation findings as to the nature, location, labor organizations and employers involved, and other relevant facts concerning the trade dispute as it deems necessary. The department shall provide its findings to its field offices in locations affected by the trade dispute, and shall, upon request, make its findings available to any employer, employers’ association or labor organization involved in the trade dispute.

######### 1264.  
(a) (1) Unemployment compensation benefits, extended duration benefits, and federal-state extended benefits shall not be payable on the basis of services performed by a person who is not a citizen or national of the United States, unless that person is an individual who was lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time the services were performed, was lawfully present for purposes of performing the services, or was permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time the services were performed, including a person who was lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of Section 203(a)(7) or Section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), and only to the extent authorized by federal law, a person who (A) is the subject of a notice of decision from the federal government granting deferred action under the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program announced by the United States Secretary of Homeland Security on June 15, 2012, and (B) performed the services while in receipt of a valid employment authorization from the federal government, is a person who was lawfully present for purposes of performing those services.

(b) Any data or information required of individuals applying for benefits specified by subdivision (a) to determine whether these benefits are not payable to them because of their federal immigration status shall be uniformly required from all applicants for these benefits.

(c) In the case of an individual whose application for benefits specified by subdivision (a) would otherwise be approved, no determination by the department, an administrative law judge, or the appeals board that these benefits to the individual are not payable because of the individual’s federal immigration status shall be made except upon a preponderance of the evidence.

(d) If a person who is not a citizen or national of the United States presents evidence that the Immigration and Naturalization Service has granted the person employment authorization as a result of an application for temporary residence status under the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-603), pending a final determination on this application the department shall not do either of the following:

(1) Commence or continue to pursue any administrative or judicial action to collect benefits where there has been a final determination that these benefits have been overpaid or chargeable to the person, because of the person’s immigration status at the time they performed the services compensated by their base period wages.

(2) Determine that the person was overpaid benefits in the current benefit year or in any prior benefit year, if the basis for the determination is the assumption that because the person is an applicant for temporary resident status they were not, while performing the services compensated by base period wages, lawfully admitted for permanent residence, lawfully present for purposes of performing the services that were compensated by their base period wages, or permanently residing in the United States under color of law.

(e) If the Immigration and Naturalization Service grants the application and adjusts the person’s status to that of lawful temporary resident, the department shall not take any action described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) or make any determination described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d). If a person is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence, lawfully present for the purpose of performing the services compensated by their base period wages, or permanently residing in the United States under color of law, at the time the person’s lawful temporary permanent status terminates, then compensation shall not be payable on the basis of services performed by the person after the termination.

(f) Nothing in subdivision (d) shall be construed to require the department to do any of the following:

(1) Repay any amounts collected under any present or past action as described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (d).

(3) Apply subdivision (d) or (e) retroactively.

(g) If the United States Secretary of Labor finds that subdivisions (d) and (e) are not in conformity with the federal Unemployment Tax Act, and effective as of the date that this finding becomes final, subdivisions (d), (e), and (f) shall be inoperative and of no legal force or effect.

(h) Unless subdivisions (d), (e), and (f) have earlier become inoperative and of no legal force or effect pursuant to a finding by the Secretary of Labor under subdivision (g), subdivisions (d), (e), (f), and (g) shall remain in effect only until September 30, 1990, and as of that date shall become inoperative, unless a later enacted statute which is chaptered before September 30, 1990, deletes or extends that date. Notwithstanding this subdivision, however, the department shall not take any action to collect benefits from an individual when the collection against that individual was suspended pursuant to subdivision (e) prior to September 30, 1990.



######### 1265.  
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this division, payments to an individual under a plan or system established by an employer which makes provisions for his employees generally, or for a class or group of his employees, for the purpose of supplementing unemployment compensation benefits shall not be construed to be wages or compensation for personal services under this division and benefits payable under this division shall not be denied or reduced because of the receipt of payments under such arrangements or plans.

This amendment is hereby declared to be merely a clarification of the original intention of the Legislature and is not a substantive change, and is in conformity with the existing administrative interpretation of the law.

##### ARTICLE 1.5.  California Training Benefits Program [1266 - 1274.20]  

######### 1266.  
This article shall be known, and may be cited, as the California Training Benefits Program. 



######### 1266.1.  
Experience has shown that the ability of a large number of the population of California to compete for jobs in the labor market is impaired by advancement in technological improvements, the widespread effects of automation and relocation in our economy, and foreign competition as set forth in petitions certified under the federal Trade Act of 1974, as amended (Title 19, United States Code, Sections 2101 et seq.). The Legislature finds that many individuals in California are lacking in skills that would make them competitive in the labor market. They are in need of training or retraining to upgrade their skills required in demand occupations. It is the policy of this state to assist these individuals by providing unemployment compensation benefits, extended duration benefits, and other federally funded unemployment compensation benefits, including those available under the federal Trade Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-618), as amended by the federal Trade Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-210), during a period of retraining to qualify them for jobs in demand occupations and thus avoid long-term unemployment.



######### 1267.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, with respect to an unemployed individual otherwise eligible for benefits, those benefits shall not be denied to an individual for any week because he or she is in eligible training or retraining, as described in Section 1269 or 1269.1, or because of the application to any such week in training or retraining of any law of this state relating to availability for work, active search for work, refusal to accept work, or for leaving his or her most recent work, if continuing the most recent work would require the individual to terminate his or her training or retraining course of instruction. The individual is considered to be in training or retraining during regularly scheduled vacation or recess periods, such as Christmas and Thanksgiving holidays, or semester breaks, but not during a summer vacation period. As used in this article, “individual” includes an exhaustee as defined in Section 3503, and any individual claiming federal-state extended benefits under Part 4 (commencing with Section 4001), and anyone receiving federally funded unemployment compensation benefits.



######### 1268.  
An unemployed individual who files a claim for unemployment compensation benefits or extended duration benefits, or an application for federal-state extended benefits or any federally funded unemployment compensation benefits, may apply to the department for a determination of potential eligibility for benefits during a period of training or retraining.



######### 1269.  
A determination of automatic eligibility for benefits under this article shall be issued to an unemployed individual if the director finds that any of the following applies:

(a) The training is authorized by the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (Public Law 113-128) or by the Employment Training Panel established pursuant to Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 10200) of Part 1 of Division 3.

(b) The training is authorized by the federal Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. Sec. 2101 et seq.), as amended, pursuant to a certified petition.

(c) The individual is a participant in the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program pursuant to Article 3.2 (commencing with Section 11320) of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and has entered into a contract with the county welfare department to participate in an education or training program.

(d) (1) The individual is a participant in training with a provider that is certified and on the state’s Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL), as authorized by the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (Public Law 113-128), or the individual is a permanent or probationary public school teacher who is a participant in a credential preparation program or training program approved or accredited by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing for additional certification in math, science, or special education, for kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive, and was laid off. The credential preparation program or training program shall only be approved if a permanent or probationary public school teacher enrolls in the training within three years of being laid off from the public school employer.

(2) The changes made to this subdivision by Chapter 278 of the Statutes of 2012, shall become operative on January 1, 2014.

(e) The individual is a journey level member of a union or trade association, or is a participant in training sponsored by an employer, and the training or retraining course of instruction is industry-related training necessary due to changes in technology, or industry demands, or is necessary to retain employment or to become more competitive in obtaining employment, or the individual is a participant in a state or federally approved apprenticeship program.



######### 1269.1.  
If the training is not authorized under Section 1269, a determination of potential eligibility for benefits under this article shall be issued to an unemployed individual if the director finds that all of the following apply:

(a) The individual has been unemployed for four or more continuous weeks, or the individual is unemployed and unlikely to return to his or her most recent workplace because work opportunities in the individual’s job classification are impaired by a plant closure or a substantial reduction in employment at the individual’s most recent workplace, by advancement in technological improvements, by the effects of automation and relocation in the economy, or because of mental or physical disability that prohibits the individual from utilizing existing occupational skills.

(b) One of the substantial causes of the individual’s unemployment is a lack of sufficient current demand in the individual’s labor market area for the occupational skills for which the individual is fitted by training and experience or current physical or mental capacity, and that the lack of employment opportunities is expected to continue for an extended period of time, or, if the individual’s occupation is one for which there is a seasonal variation in demand in the labor market and the individual has no other skill for which there is current demand.

(c) The training or retraining course of instruction relates to an occupation or skill for which there are, or are expected to be in the immediate future, reasonable employment opportunities in the labor market area in this state in which the individual intends to seek work and there is not a substantial surplus of workers with requisite skills in the occupation in that area.

(d) The training or retraining course of instruction is one approved by the director and can be completed within a reasonable period of time.

(e) The training or retraining course is a full-time course prescribed for the primary purpose of training the applicant in skills that will allow him or her to obtain employment in a demand occupation.

(f) The individual can be reasonably expected to complete the training or retraining successfully.

(g) The beginning date of training is more than three years after the beginning date of training last approved for the individual under this subdivision.

(h) (1) If a determination of potential eligibility for benefits is issued under this section, except under subdivision (c), and when federal extended unemployment insurance benefits are in effect, the director may find that an unemployed individual is eligible for training benefits if the individual is enrolled in a community college or other accredited postsecondary education program with the purpose of preparing the applicant in academic or job skills, including remedial training, that will increase employment opportunities or that leads to an industry-recognized credential or certificate designed for a specific occupation. If an individual is approved for training benefits under this subdivision and the federal extended unemployment insurance benefits are subsequently no longer in effect, the individual shall remain eligible as long as he or she is attending the training and is meeting the provisions of this article.

(2) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:

(A) “Accredited” means an institution recognized or approved by an accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education.

(b) He or she submits a certification, as prescribed by the Employment Development Department through regulations, certifying that he or she is enrolled in and satisfactorily pursuing the training or retraining course of instruction.

##### ARTICLE 2. Computation (Amount and Duration) [1275 - 1282]  

######### 1275.  
(a) Unemployment compensation benefit award computations shall be based on wages paid in the base period. “Base period” means: for benefit years beginning in October, November, or December, the four calendar quarters ended in the next preceding month of June; for benefit years beginning in January, February, or March, the four calendar quarters ended in the next preceding month of September; for benefit years beginning in April, May, or June, the four calendar quarters ended in the next preceding month of December; for benefit years beginning in July, August, or September, the four calendar quarters ended with the next preceding month of March. Wages used in the determination of benefits payable to an individual during any benefit year may not be used in determining that individual’s benefits in any subsequent benefit year.

(b) For any new claim filed on or after April 2, 2012, or earlier if the department implements the technical changes necessary to establish claims under the alternate base period, as specified in subdivision (c), if an individual cannot establish a claim under subdivision (a), then “base period” means: for benefit years beginning in October, November, or December, the four calendar quarters ended in the next preceding month of September; for benefit years beginning in January, February, or March, the four calendar quarters ended in the next preceding month of December; for benefit years beginning in April, May, or June, the four calendar quarters ended in the next preceding month of March; for benefit years beginning in July, August, or September, the four calendar quarters ended in the next preceding month of June. As provided in Section 1280, the quarter with the highest wages shall be used to determine the individual’s weekly benefit amount. Wages used in the determination of benefits payable to an individual during any benefit year may not be used in determining that individual’s benefits in any subsequent benefit year.

(c) The department shall implement the technical changes necessary to establish claims under the alternate base period specified in subdivision (b) as soon as possible, but no later than April 2, 2012.



######### 1276.  
“Benefit year”, with respect to any individual, means the 52-week period beginning with the first day of the week with respect to which the individual first files a valid claim for benefits and thereafter the 52-week period beginning with the week in which such individual again files a valid claim after the termination of his or her last preceding benefit year. As used in this section, “valid claim” means any claim for benefits made in accordance with this division and authorized regulations if the individual filing the claim is unemployed and has met the requirements of subdivision (a) of Section 1281. For the purpose of determining whether a claim is a “valid claim” within the meaning of this section, an individual otherwise unemployed shall be deemed unemployed even though wages, as defined in Section 1252, which are for a period subsequent to the termination of performance of services are payable with respect to the week for which he or she files the claim.



######### 1277.  
Notwithstanding Section 1281, if the base period of a new claim includes wages which were paid prior to the effective date of, and not used in the computation of the award for, a previous valid claim, the new claim shall only be valid if, during the 52-week period beginning with the effective date of the previous valid claim, either of the following applies:

(a) The individual earned or was paid sufficient wages to meet the eligibility requirements of subdivision (a) of Section 1281 and performed some work.

(b) The individual did not receive benefits under this part, and was disabled and was entitled to receive, wage loss benefits under Part 2 (commencing with Section 2601) of this division or under Division 4 (commencing with Section 3201) of the Labor Code, or under any workers’ compensation law, employer’s liability law, or disability insurance law of any other state or of the federal government.

For the purpose of this section only, the term “wages” includes any and all compensation for personal services performed as an employee for the purpose of meeting the eligibility requirements under subdivision (a) of Section 1281. This section is not applicable to the computation of an award for disability benefits.



######### 1277.1.  
(a) Notwithstanding Section 1277, if an individual has a subsequent new claim and the previous valid claim was filed under subdivision (b) of Section 1275, the new claim shall only be valid if, during the 52-week period beginning with the effective date of the previous claim, either of the following applies:

(1) The individual earned or was paid sufficient wages to meet eligibility requirements of subdivision (a) of Section 1281 and performed some work.

(2) The individual did not receive benefits under this part and was disabled and was entitled to receive wage loss benefits under Part 2 (commencing with Section 2601) or under Division 4 (commencing with Section 3200) of the Labor Code, under any workers’ compensation law, under employer’s liability law, or under any disability insurance law of any other state or the federal government.

(b) For purposes of this section, “wages” includes any and all compensation for personal services performed as an employee for the purpose of meeting the eligibility requirements of subdivision (a) of Section 1281. This subdivision is not applicable to the computation of an award for disability benefits. 



######### 1277.5.  
In determining, under Sections 1277 and 1277.1, whether a new claim is valid, twice the amount that an individual was entitled to receive under Part 2 (commencing with Section 2601) of this division or under Division 4 (commencing with Section 3200) of the Labor Code, or under any workers’ compensation law, employer’s liability law, or disability insurance law of any other state or of the federal government, during the 52-week period beginning with the effective date of the previous valid claim, shall be considered as wages earned or paid to the individual during that 52-week period for purposes of meeting the eligibility requirements of subdivision (a) of Section 1281. The amounts so included shall not be considered wages for the purpose of computing the weekly benefit amount of the individual under Section 1280 or the maximum amount payable to the individual under Section 1281.



######### 1278.  
For the purposes of this chapter, wages shall be counted as “wages for employment for employers” for benefit purposes with respect to any benefit year only if the benefit year begins subsequent to the date on which the employer from whom the wages were earned has satisfied the conditions of this division with respect to being an employer.



######### 1279.  
(a) Each individual eligible under this chapter who is unemployed in any week shall be paid with respect to that week an unemployment compensation benefit in an amount equal to his or her weekly benefit amount less the smaller of the following:

(1) The amount of wages in excess of twenty-five dollars ($25) payable to him or her for services rendered during that week.

(2) The amount of wages in excess of 25 percent of the amount of wages payable to him or her for services rendered during that week.

(b) The benefit payment, if not a multiple of one dollar ($1), shall be computed to the next higher multiple of one dollar ($1).

(c) For the purpose of this section only “wages” includes any and all compensation for personal services whether performed as an employee or as an independent contractor or as a juror or as a witness, but does not include any payments, regardless of their designation, made by a city of this state to an elected official thereof as an incident to public office, nor any payment received by a member of the National Guard or reserve component of the armed forces for inactive duty training, annual training, or emergency state active duty.



######### 1279.5.  
(a) Notwithstanding Section 1252 or 1252.2 or any other provision of this part, for the purposes of this section an individual is “unemployed” in any week if the individual works less than his or her normal weekly hours of work for the individual’s regular employer, and the director finds that the regular employer has reduced or restricted the individual’s normal hours of work, or has rehired an individual previously laid off and reduced that individual’s normal hours of work from those previously worked, as the result of a plan by the regular employer to, in lieu of layoff, reduce employment and stabilize the work force by a program of sharing the work remaining after a reduction in total hours of work and a corresponding reduction in wages of at least 10 percent. The application for approval of a plan shall require the employer to briefly describe the circumstances requiring the use of work sharing to avoid a layoff. Normal weekly hours of work means the number of hours in a week that the employee normally would work for the regular employer or 40 hours, whichever is less. The plan must involve the participation of at least two employees and include not less than 10 percent of the employer’s regular permanent work force involved in the affected work unit or units in each week, or in at least one week of a two-consecutive-week period. A plan approved by the director shall expire six months after the effective date of the plan.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, each individual eligible under this chapter who is “unemployed” in any week shall be paid with respect to that week a weekly shared work unemployment compensation benefit amount equal to the percentage of reduction of the individual’s wages resulting from an approved plan, rounded to the nearest 5 percent, multiplied by the individual’s weekly benefit amount.

(c) No individual who receives any benefits under this section during any benefit year shall receive any benefits pursuant to Section 1252 or 1252.2 as a partially unemployed individual with respect to any week during such benefit year while in employment status with the regular employer who initiated the program of sharing work under this section. No benefits under this section shall be payable on any type of extended claim.

(d) Any amount payable under this section shall be reduced by the amount of any and all compensation payable for personal services whether performed as an employee or an independent contractor or as a juror or as a witness, except compensation payable by the regular employer under a shared workplan.

For the purposes of this subdivision, “regular employer” may include, pursuant to an approved plan, a labor organization which periodically employs individuals in accordance with a collective bargaining agreement.

(e) The benefit payment under this section, if not a multiple of one dollar ($1), shall be increased to the next higher multiple of one dollar ($1).

(f)  Sections 1253.5 and 1279 shall not apply to any individual eligible for any payment under this section.

(g) For the purposes of this section, an individual shall not be disqualified under subdivision (c) of Section 1253 for any week if both of the following conditions exist:

(1) The individual has not been absent from work without the approval of the regular employer.

(2) The individual accepted all work the regular employer made available to the individual during hours scheduled off due to the work sharing plan.

(h) Except as otherwise provided by or inconsistent with this section, all provisions of this division and authorized regulations apply to benefits under this section. Authorized regulations may, to the extent permitted by federal law, make such distinctions and requirements as may be necessary in the procedures and provisions applicable to unemployed individuals to carry out the purposes of this section, including regulations defining normal hours, days, workweek, and wages.

(i) Employees shall not be eligible to receive any benefits under this section unless their employer agrees, in writing, and their bargaining agent pursuant to any applicable collective bargaining agreement agrees, in writing, to voluntarily participate in the shared work unemployment insurance benefit program created by this section.

(j) Notwithstanding Section 1327, the department shall not be required to notify an employer of additional claims which result from an approved plan submitted by the employer under which benefits are not paid in each week.

(k) The director may terminate a shared work plan for good cause if the plan is not being carried out according to its terms and intent.

(l) This section shall apply to work sharing plans that become effective before July 1, 2014. No work sharing plan that becomes effective before July 1, 2014, shall be renewed on or after July 1, 2014. Any work sharing plan that is entered into on or after July 1, 2014, shall be subject to Section 1279.5 as added by Assembly Bill 1392 of the 2013–14 Regular Session.



(a) As used in this section:

(1) “Affected unit” means a specified plant, department, shift, or other definable unit that includes two or more workers and not less than 10 percent of the employer’s regular permanent work force involved in the affected unit or units in each week, or in at least one week of a two-consecutive-week period, to which an approved work sharing plan applies.

(2) “Health and retirement benefits” means employer-provided health benefits and retirement benefits under a defined benefit pension plan, as defined in Section 414(j) of the Internal Revenue Code, or contributions under a defined contribution plan, as defined in Section 414(i) of the Internal Revenue Code, that are incidents of employment in addition to the cash remuneration earned.

(3) “Work sharing compensation” means the unemployment compensation benefits payable to employees in an affected unit under an approved work sharing plan, as distinguished from the unemployment compensation benefits otherwise payable under this part.

(4) “Work sharing plan” means a plan submitted by an employer, for approval by the director, under which the employer requests the payment of work sharing compensation to employees in an affected unit of the employer in lieu of layoffs.

(5) “Work sharing program” means the program described by this section.

(6) “Usual weekly hours of work” means the usual hours of work for full- or part-time employees in the affected unit when that unit is operating on its regular basis, not to exceed 40 hours and not including hours of overtime work.

(7) “Unemployment compensation” means the unemployment compensation benefits payable under this part other than work sharing compensation and includes amounts payable pursuant to an agreement under federal law providing for compensation, assistance, or allowances with respect to unemployment.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 1252 or 1252.2 or any other provision of this part, for the purposes of this section an employee is “unemployed” in any week if the employee works less than their usual weekly hours of work for the employee’s regular employer, as the result of the regular employer’s participation in a work sharing plan that meets the requirements of this section and has been approved by the director, pursuant to which the employer, in lieu of layoff, reduces employment and stabilizes the workforce.

(c) Except as provided in Section 1279.7 an employer wishing to participate in the work sharing program, on and after July 1, 2014, shall submit a signed written work sharing plan to the director for approval. The director shall develop an application form to request approval of a work sharing plan and an approval process that meets the requirements of this section. The application shall include, but is not limited to, the following:

(1) The affected unit covered by the plan, including the number of full- or part-time employees in the unit, the percentage of employees in the affected unit covered by the plan, identification of each individual employee in the affected unit by name, social security number, and the employer’s unemployment tax account number and any other information required by the director to identify plan participants.

(2) A description of how employees in the affected unit will be notified of the employer’s participation in the work sharing plan if the application is approved, including how the employer will notify those employees in a collective bargaining unit as well as any employees in the affected unit who are not in a collective bargaining unit. If the employer does not intend to provide advance notice to employees in the affected unit, the employer shall explain in a statement in the application why it is not feasible to provide that notice.

(3) A requirement that the employer identify, in the application, the usual weekly hours of work for employees in the affected unit and the specific percentage by which their hours will be reduced during all weeks covered by the plan. The percentage of reduction of usual weekly hours of work for which a work sharing plan may be approved shall not be less than 10 percent or more than 60 percent. If the plan includes any week for which the employer regularly does not provide work, including, but not limited to, incidences due to a holiday or plant closing, then that week shall be identified in the application.

(4) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), certification by the employer, if the employer provides health and retirement benefits to any employee whose usual weekly hours of work are to be reduced under the plan, that the benefits will continue to be provided, to the extent permitted by federal law, to employees participating in the work sharing plan under the same terms and conditions as though the usual weekly hours of work of these employees had not been reduced or to the same extent as other employees not participating in the work sharing plan. For defined benefit retirement plans, to the extent permitted by federal law, the hours that are reduced under the work sharing plan shall be credited for purposes of participation, vesting, and accrual of benefits as though the usual weekly hours of work had not been reduced. The dollar amount of employer contributions to a defined contribution plan that are based on a percentage of compensation may be less due to the reduction in the employee’s compensation.

(B) If a reduction in health and retirement benefits is scheduled to occur during the duration of the plan and those reductions will be applied equally to employees who are not participating in the work sharing program, then the application shall so certify, and those benefits may be reduced for those employees who are participating in the work sharing plan.

(5) Certification by the employer that the aggregate reduction in work hours is in lieu of temporary or permanent layoffs, or both. The application shall include an estimate of the number of workers who would have been laid off in the absence of the work sharing plan.

(6) Agreement by the employer to do all of the following:

(B) Allow the director or the director’s authorized representatives access to all records necessary to approve or disapprove the plan application.

(C) After approval of a plan, monitor and evaluate the plan.

(D) Follow any other directives the director deems necessary for the department to implement the plan and that are consistent with the requirements for plan applications.

(7) Certification by the employer that participation in the work sharing plan and its implementation is consistent with the employer’s obligations under applicable federal and state laws.

(8) The effective date and duration of the plan, which shall not be later than the end of the 12th full calendar month after the effective date.

(9) Any other provision added to the application by the director that the United States Secretary of Labor determines to be appropriate for purposes of a work sharing plan.

(d) The director shall approve or disapprove a work sharing plan in writing by the close of business no later than 10 working days from the date the completed plan is received and communicate the decision to the employer. A decision disapproving the plan shall clearly identify the reasons for the disapproval. Within 20 days, the employer may submit a request for review of the disapproved work sharing plan to the director’s work sharing administrator, whom the director shall designate for this purpose. After review, the work sharing administrator’s decision of approval or disapproval shall be final. If disapproved, the employer may submit a different work sharing plan for approval.

(e) The director shall work with the employer to determine the effective date of a work sharing plan, which shall be specified in the notice of approval to the employer. The plan shall expire on the date specified in the notice of approval, which shall be either the date at the end of the 12th full calendar month after its effective date or an earlier date mutually agreed upon by the employer and the director. However, if a work sharing plan is revoked by the director under subdivision (f) of this section, the plan shall terminate on the date specified in the director’s written order of revocation. An employer may terminate a work sharing plan at any time upon written notice to the director. An employer may submit an application to renew the work sharing plan not more than 10 days after a previously approved work sharing plan expires.

(f) The director may revoke approval of a work sharing plan for good cause at any time. The revocation order shall be in writing and shall specify the reasons for the revocation and the date the revocation is effective. The director may periodically review the operation of an employer’s work sharing plan to ensure that good cause does not exist for revocation of the approval of the plan. For purposes of these provisions, good cause includes, but is not limited to, failure to comply with the assurances given in the plan, unreasonable revision of productivity standards for the affected unit, conduct or occurrences tending to defeat the intent and effective operation of the work sharing plan, and violation of any criteria on which approval of the plan was based.

(g) An employer may request a modification of an approved plan by filing a written request to the director. The request shall identify the specific provisions proposed to be modified and provide an explanation of why the proposed modification is appropriate for the work sharing plan. The director shall approve or disapprove the proposed modification in writing by the close of business no later than 10 working days from the date the proposed modification is received and communicate the decision to the employer. The director, in the director’s discretion, may approve a request for modification of the plan based on conditions that have changed since the plan was approved, provided that the modification is consistent with and supports the purposes for which the plan was initially approved. A modification does not extend the expiration date of the original plan, and the director shall promptly notify the employer whether the plan modification has been approved and, if approved, the effective date of the modification, which shall not be earlier than the effective date of the original work sharing plan. An employer is not required to request approval of a plan modification from the director if the change is not substantial, but the employer shall promptly report, in writing, every change to the plan to the director. The director may terminate an employer’s plan if the employer fails to meet this reporting requirement. If the director determines that the reported change is substantial, the director shall require the employer to request a modification to the plan.

(h) (1) An employee is eligible to receive work sharing compensation with respect to any week only if the employee is monetarily eligible for unemployment compensation, not otherwise disqualified for unemployment compensation, and both of the following are true:

(A) During the week, the employee is employed as a member of an affected unit under an approved work sharing plan, which was approved prior to that week, and the plan is in effect with respect to the week for which work sharing compensation is claimed.

(B) Notwithstanding any other provisions relating to availability for work and actively seeking work, the employee is available for the employee’s usual hours of work with the work sharing employer, which may include, for purposes of this section, participating in training to enhance job skills that is approved by the director, such as employer-sponsored training or training funded under the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 3101 et seq.).

(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an employee covered by a work sharing plan is deemed unemployed in any week during the duration of that plan if the employee’s remuneration as an employee in an affected unit is reduced based on a reduction of the employee’s usual weekly hours of work under an approved work sharing plan.

(i) For the purposes of this section, an employee shall not be disqualified under subdivision (c) of Section 1253 for any week if both of the following conditions exist:

(1) The employee has not been absent from work without the approval of the regular employer.

(2) The employee accepted all work the regular employer made available to the individual during hours scheduled off due to the work sharing plan.

(j) The work sharing weekly compensation amount shall be the product of the regular weekly unemployment compensation amount for a week of total unemployment multiplied by the percentage of reduction in the individual’s usual weekly hours of work.

(k) (1) Provisions applicable to unemployment compensation shall apply to employees in a work sharing plan to the extent that they are not inconsistent with work sharing program provisions. An employee who files an initial claim for work sharing compensation shall receive a monetary determination. An employee may be eligible for work sharing compensation or unemployment compensation, as appropriate, except that an employee shall not be eligible for combined benefits in any benefit year in an amount more than the maximum entitlement established for regular unemployment compensation, nor shall an employee be paid work sharing benefits for more than 52 weeks under a work sharing plan.

(2) An employee who is not provided any work during a week by the work sharing employer, or any other employer, and who is otherwise eligible for unemployment compensation, shall be eligible for the amount of regular unemployment compensation to which the employee would otherwise be eligible.

(3) An employee who is not provided any work by the work sharing employer during a week, but who works for another employer and is otherwise eligible, may be paid unemployment compensation for that week subject to the disqualifying income and other provisions applicable to claims for regular unemployment compensation.

(4) The work sharing compensation paid to an employee shall be deducted from the maximum entitlement amount of regular unemployment compensation established for that employee’s benefit year.

(5) An employee who has received all of the work sharing compensation or combined unemployment compensation and work sharing compensation available in a benefit year shall be considered an exhaustee for purposes of extended benefits and, if otherwise eligible under those provisions, shall be eligible to receive extended benefits.

(6) No employee who receives any benefits under this section during any benefit year shall receive any benefits pursuant to Section 1252 or 1252.2 as a partially unemployed individual with respect to any week during a benefit year while in employment status with the regular employer who initiated the work sharing plan under this section.

(7) Sections 1253.5 and 1279 shall not apply to any individual eligible for any payment under this section.

(l) Any amount payable under this section shall be reduced by the amount of any and all compensation payable for personal services, whether performed as an employee or an independent contractor or as a juror or as a witness, except compensation payable by the regular employer under a work sharing plan. For the purposes of this subdivision, “regular employer” may include, pursuant to an approved plan, a labor organization that periodically employs individuals in accordance with a collective bargaining agreement.

(m) Work sharing compensation shall be charged to employers’ experience rating accounts in the same manner as unemployment compensation is charged under this part. Employers liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall have work sharing compensation attributed to service in their employ in the same manner as unemployment compensation is attributed.

(n) The benefit payment under this section, if not a multiple of one dollar ($1), shall be increased to the next higher multiple of one dollar ($1).

(o) Except as otherwise provided by or inconsistent with this section, all provisions of this division and authorized regulations apply to benefits under this section. Authorized regulations may, to the extent permitted by federal law, make those distinctions and requirements as may be necessary in the procedures and provisions applicable to unemployed individuals to carry out the purposes of this section, including, but not limited to, regulations defining normal hours, days, workweeks, and wages.

(p) Employees shall not be eligible to receive any benefits under this section unless their employer agrees, in writing, and their bargaining agent pursuant to any applicable collective bargaining agreement agrees, in writing, to voluntarily participate in the work sharing program created by this section.

(q) Notwithstanding Section 1327, the department shall not be required to notify an employer of additional claims that result from an approved plan submitted by the employer under which benefits are not paid in each week.

(r) This section shall become operative on July 1, 2014. This section shall apply to work sharing plans that become effective on or after July 1, 2014.



######### 1279.6.  
The department may collaborate with the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development and the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank to develop and implement strategic outreach to increase participation by employers in the work sharing program described in Section 1279.5 and to provide information to employers about their ability to rehire former employees, based on federal guidance.



######### 1279.7.  
(a) Notwithstanding subdivision (c) of Section 1279.5, the director shall accept a work sharing plan application submitted electronically by an employer wishing to participate in, or renew participation in, the work sharing program. The department shall create a portal on its internet website for the provision and receipt of these applications.

(b) Beginning September 15, 2020, work sharing plan applications submitted by eligible employers to participate in, or renew participation in, the work sharing program, upon approval by the director, shall be deemed approved for one year, unless a shorter plan is requested by the employer and approved by the director pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 1279.5. The department shall mail to an eligible employer a claim packet for each participating employee within five business days following approval of the application. For an employer that submitted a work sharing plan application online, the department shall make online claim forms available to the approved employer for each participating employee within five business days following approval of the application. After the participating employer and employees complete and submit the documents in the claim packet, the department shall establish an unemployment insurance claim pursuant to applicable requirements. Participating employers and employees shall meet the required unemployment insurance claim filing and weekly certification requirements and employers shall be responsible for the completeness and integrity of each work sharing certification form issued to a participating employee.

(c) Notwithstanding any other law, the department shall accept electronic signatures on all work sharing plan documents. 

(d) The provisions of this section shall be implemented consistently with the requirements of federal law.



######### 1280.

If the amount of wages paid an individual for employment by employers exceeds four thousand nine hundred sixty-six dollars and ninety-nine cents ($4,966.99) in the quarter of his or her base period in which these wages were highest, the individual’s weekly benefit amount shall be 39 percent of these wages divided by 13, but in no case shall this amount exceed two hundred thirty dollars ($230).

If the amount of wages paid an individual for employment by employers exceeds two thousand seven hundred eighty-one dollars and ninety-nine cents ($2,781.99) in the quarter of his or her base period in which these wages were highest, the individual’s weekly benefit amount shall be 45 percent of these wages divided by 13, but in no case may this amount exceed three hundred thirty dollars ($330).

(c) For new claims filed with an effective date beginning on or after January 1, 2003, an individual’s weekly benefit amount is the amount appearing in column B in the following table opposite the wage bracket in column A that contains the wages paid to the individual for employment by employers during the quarter of his or her base period in which his or her wages were the highest.

If the amount of wages paid an individual for employment by employers exceeds one thousand eight hundred thirty-two dollars and ninety-nine cents ($1,832.99) in the quarter of his or her base period in which these wages were highest, the individual’s weekly benefit amount shall be 50 percent of these wages divided by 13, but in no case shall this amount exceed the applicable of the following:

(1) For new claims filed with an effective date beginning on or after January 1, 2003, and before January 1, 2004, three hundred seventy dollars ($370).

(2) For new claims filed with an effective date beginning on or after January 1, 2004, and before January 1, 2005, four hundred ten dollars ($410).

(3) For new claims filed with an effective date beginning on or after January 1, 2005, four hundred fifty dollars ($450).

If the benefit payable under this subdivision is not a multiple of one dollar ($1), it shall be computed to the next higher multiple of one dollar ($1).



######### 1281.  
(a) An individual cannot establish a valid claim or a benefit year during which any benefits are payable unless during his or her base period, for new claims filed with an effective date beginning on or after January 1, 1992, he or she has met either of the following conditions:

(1) He or she has been paid wages for employment by employers during the quarter of his or her base period in which his or her wages were the highest of not less than one thousand three hundred dollars ($1,300).

(2) He or she has been paid wages for employment by employers during the quarter of his or her base period in which his or her wages were the highest of not less than nine hundred dollars ($900) and been paid wages for employment by employers during his or her base period equal to 1.25 times the amount he or she was paid in this same quarter.

(b) Except as provided by subdivision (c), the maximum amount of unemployment compensation benefits payable to an individual during any one benefit year shall not exceed the lower of the following:

(1) Twenty-six times his or her weekly benefit amount.

(2) One-half the total wages paid to the individual during his or her base period.

(c) If the maximum amount computed under subdivision (b) is not a multiple of one dollar ($1) it shall be computed to the next higher multiple of one dollar ($1).

(d) For the purpose of this section and Section 1280, in determining wages paid, “wages” includes wages due to any individual but unpaid within the time limit provided by law.



######### 1282.  
If the remuneration of an individual is not based upon a fixed period or duration of time or if the individual’s wages are paid at irregular intervals or in such manner as not to extend regularly over the period of employment, the wages for any week or for any calendar quarter for the purpose of computing an individual’s right to unemployment compensation benefits shall be determined pursuant to authorized regulations. The regulations shall, so far as possible, secure results reasonably similar to those which would prevail if the individual were paid his wages at regular intervals.









##### ARTICLE 2.2. Self-Employment Assistance Program [1300- 1300.]  

######### 1300.  
The Legislature finds that the traditional system of unemployment compensation is primarily designed to provide income support for workers who are temporarily laid off or expect to be unemployed for only a short time. However, increasing numbers of workers are losing their jobs permanently due to rapid technological change, elimination of trade barriers, and similar causes. These workers need additional tools besides the basic income maintenance provided by the unemployment compensation system in order to reenter the workforce. For some of those workers, access to a self-employment program would be the best path for them to do so. Accordingly, it is the purpose of this article to authorize the payment of unemployment compensation benefits, and to provide appropriate training and support services, for eligible dislocated workers who wish to become self-employed in their transition back into the workforce.









##### ARTICLE 3. Filing, Determination, and Payment of Unemployment Compensation Benefit Claims [1326 - 1345]  

######### 1326.  
Claims for unemployment compensation benefits shall be made in accordance with authorized regulations of the director. Except as otherwise provided in this article, the department shall promptly pay benefits if it finds the claimant is eligible or shall promptly deny benefits if it finds the claimant is ineligible.



######### 1326.5.  
An individual shall, to maintain his or her eligibility to file continued claims during a continuous period of unemployment, submit a continued claim not more than 14 days from the end of the last week’s ending date shown on the continued claim, or not more than 14 days from the date the department issued that continued claim, whichever is later, unless the department finds good cause for the individual’s delay in submitting the continued claim. An unemployed individual may not be disqualified for unemployment compensation benefits solely on the basis that the continued claim was submitted 15 to 21 days, inclusive, from the end of the last week’s ending date shown on the continued claim, or 15 to 21 days inclusive, from the date the department issued that continued claim, whichever is later.



######### 1326.8.  
The department shall request any personal identification information required from the claimant under this part in accordance with the most recent federal National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-63 standards, relating to technical requirements for implementing digital identity services, and as those standards may be amended or updated from time to time.



######### 1327.  
The department shall give a notice of the filing of a new or additional claim to the employing unit by which the claimant was last employed immediately preceding the filing of the claim unless the additional claim is the result of the filing of a partial claim as defined by the department, there has not been a subsequent employing unit which is designated as the last employer, and there is no separation issue.  The employing unit so notified shall submit within 10 days after the mailing of the notice any facts then known that may affect the claimant’s eligibility for benefits, including, but not limited to, facts pertaining to eligibility under Section 1256. The 10-day period may be extended for good cause.  If after the 10-day period the employing unit acquires knowledge of facts that may affect the eligibility of the claimant and facts could not reasonably have been known within the period, the employing unit shall, within 10 days of acquiring the knowledge, submit the facts to the department, and the 10-day period may also be extended for good cause.



######### 1328.  
(a) The department shall consider the facts submitted by an employer pursuant to Section 1327 and make a determination as to the claimant’s eligibility for benefits. The department shall promptly notify the claimant and any employer who before the determination has submitted facts or given notice pursuant to Section 1327 or this section and authorized regulations of the determination or reconsidered determination and the reasons therefor. If, after notice of a determination or reconsidered determination, the employing unit acquires knowledge of facts that may affect the eligibility of the claimant and those facts could not reasonably have been known within the 10-day period provided by Section 1327, the employing unit shall within 10 days of acquiring that knowledge submit those facts to the department, and the 10-day period may be extended for good cause. The claimant and the employer may appeal from a determination or reconsidered determination to an administrative law judge within 30 days from service of notice of the determination or reconsidered determination. The 30-day period may be extended for good cause, which shall include, but not be limited to, mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The director shall be an interested party to any appeal.

(b) This section shall become operative on July 1, 2015.



######### 1329.  
(a) Upon the filing of a new claim for benefits, the department shall promptly make a computation on the claim that shall set forth the maximum amount of benefits potentially payable during the benefit year, and the weekly benefit amount. The department shall promptly notify the claimant of the computation and the method of computation. The department shall promptly notify each of the claimant’s base period employers of the computation after the payment of the first weekly benefit.

(b) The department shall promptly notify each of the claimant’s base period employers of the computation on the claim that shall set forth the number of weeks that the claimant will be eligible for benefits in the benefit year, the weekly benefit amount, and the maximum amount of benefits potentially payable during the benefit year, based on a determination of eligibility under Article 1.5 (commencing with Section 1266).



######### 1329.1.  
A claim for unemployment compensation benefits may be canceled if all of the following apply:

(a) The individual has not been deemed ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits.

(b) The individual has not been overpaid unemployment compensation benefits.

(c) The individual has not been paid unemployment compensation benefits.

(d) The individual requests to cancel the claim during the benefit year of that claim, or in the case of a claim for federal-state extended duration benefits, during the extended duration period of that claim.



######### 1329.5.  
For purposes of a claim for unemployment benefits under subdivision (b) of Section 1275, all of the following apply:

(a) Computation using the last four completed calendar quarters shall be based on available wage information processed as of the close of business on the day preceding the date of application.

(b) If the wage information is not already in the department’s system, the department shall request the information from the employer, and the employer shall, within 10 days after the mailing of the request from the department, transmit to the department information on the employee’s wages and any other information relevant to the request. The 10-day period may be extended for good cause.

(c) If the wage, and other relevant information, requested pursuant to subdivision (b) are not received by the department, the department shall accept an affidavit of wages and other relevant information from the claimant in accordance with authorized regulations. These regulations shall be adopted as emergency regulations.

(d) A determination of benefits made pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1275 shall be adjusted when the quarterly wage report from the employer is received if that information causes a change in the determination.

(e) Except in the event of fraud, if it is determined that any information provided by the claimant on an affidavit is erroneous, no penalty or refund of benefits shall be imposed on the claimant for the period prior to the calendar week in which an employer provides subsequent wage information. 



######### 1330.  
(a) The claimant and any base period employer to whom a notice of computation or recomputation is given may, within 30 days after the service of the notice, protest the accuracy of the computation or recomputation. The 30-day period may be extended for good cause. The department shall consider this protest and shall promptly notify the claimant and the base period employer submitting the protest of the recomputation or denial of recomputation. An appeal may be taken from a notice of denial of recomputation in the manner prescribed in Section 1328. The director shall be an interested party to any appeal.

(b) “Good cause,” as used in this section, shall include, but not be limited to, mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.

(c) This section shall become operative on July 1, 2015.



######### 1331.  
Any base period employer shall, within 15 days after mailing of a notice of computation, submit to the department any facts then known which he or she was not previously required to submit to the department under Section 1327 which may affect the claimant’s eligibility for benefits. The 15-day period may be extended for good cause. If after such 15-day period the employing unit acquires knowledge of facts which may affect the eligibility of the claimant and such facts could not reasonably have been known within the period, the employing unit shall, within 10 days of acquiring such knowledge, submit such facts to the department. The 10-day period may be extended for good cause. The department shall make a determination or reconsidered determination thereon and shall promptly notify the claimant and the base period employer submitting the facts of the determination or reconsidered determination and the reasons therefor. An appeal may be taken in the manner prescribed in Section 1328. The director shall be an interested party to any appeal.



######### 1332.  
(a) The department shall promptly serve notice of any determination of eligibility for benefits under this part or Part 3 (commencing with Section 3501) or Part 4 (commencing with Section 4001) of this division on the claimant and on any employer or employing unit which prior to this determination has furnished the department with information regarding the claimant’s eligibility pursuant to Sections 1327 and 1331. Service may be made personally, electronically, by mail, or in any other manner the department elects. Unless a notice is personally served, service shall be deemed completed on the date on which the notice is sent, mailed, or emailed. If a notice is personally served, service shall be deemed completed on the date on which the notice is delivered. Failure to serve this notice shall not affect the determination of eligibility.

(1) “Notice” is that notification which apprises the party of a determination of eligibility and allows that party to respond accordingly.

(2) If the department is or should be aware that the notice was not received by the party to whom it was addressed, including, but not limited to, the return to the department of the notice by the United States Post Office, the department shall reissue the notice at such time as the department can determine a corrected mailing address for the affected party or otherwise ensure receipt. The affected party shall have appeal rights pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c), and pursuant to Section 1328.

(b) The department may for good cause reconsider any determination within 15 days after an appeal to an administrative law judge is filed. If no appeal is filed, the department may for good cause reconsider any determination within 30 days after service of the notice of determination. The department may, if a claimant has not filed an appeal to an administrative law judge from any determination that finds that a claimant is ineligible or disqualified, or if an appeal has been filed but is either withdrawn or dismissed, for good cause also reconsider the determination during the benefit year or extended duration period or extended benefit period to which the determination relates. The department shall give notice of any reconsidered determination to the claimant and any employer or employing unit that received notice under Sections 1328 and 1331 and the claimant or employer may appeal therefrom in the manner prescribed in Section 1328.

The director shall designate individuals to review and reconsider appealed determinations. No individual designated shall be the same individual who made the initial determination in the same matter.

(c) The department may for good cause reconsider any computation or recomputation provided for in this article during the benefit year or extended duration period to which the notice of computation or recomputation relates, except that no recomputation may be considered with respect to any issue considered or under consideration in an appeal taken from a denial of recomputation. The department shall promptly notify the claimant and each of the claimant’s base period employers of the recomputation. The claimant and any base period employer may protest the accuracy of the recomputation as prescribed in Section 1330.

(d) This section shall become operative on July 1, 2015.



######### 1332.5.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this division any provision that prescribes time limits within which the department may reconsider any determination, ruling, or computation or any provision that otherwise restricts or prevents such reconsideration, shall not apply in any case of fraud, misrepresentation or willful nondisclosure.



######### 1333.  
Notices, protests, and information required under this article shall be submitted in accordance with authorized regulations.



######### 1334.  
(a) An administrative law judge after affording a reasonable opportunity for fair hearing, shall, unless the appeal is withdrawn, affirm, reverse, modify, or set aside any determination that is appealed under this article. The claimant, the employer becoming a party to the appeal by submitting a protest or information pursuant to Sections 1326 to 1333, inclusive, of this article, and the director shall be promptly notified in writing of the administrative law judge’s decision, together with reasons for it. The decision shall be final unless, within 30 days after mailing of the decision, further appeal is initiated to the appeals board pursuant to Section 1336. The 30-day limitation may be extended for good cause.

(b) “Good cause,” as used in this section, shall include, but not be limited to, mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 

(c) This section shall become operative on July 1, 2015.



######### 1335.  
If an appeal is filed, benefits with respect to the period prior to the final decision on the appeal shall be paid only after the decision, except that:

(a) If benefits for any week are payable in accordance with a determination by the department irrespective of any decision on the issues set forth in the appeal, such benefits shall be promptly paid regardless of such appeal.

(b) If an administrative law judge affirms a determination allowing benefits, such benefits shall be promptly paid regardless of any appeal which may thereafter be taken, and regardless of any action taken under Section 1336 or otherwise by the director, appeals board, or other administrative body or by any court.

If the determination is finally reversed, no employer’s account shall be charged with benefits paid because of that determination, except as provided in Section 1026, or if the department determines pursuant to Section 1026.1 that the employer’s reserve account should not be credited.

(c) If benefits for any week are payable in accordance with a determination by the department, or an administrative law judge issues a decision allowing benefits, the benefits shall be promptly paid regardless of any appeal, and regardless of any action taken by the appeals board pursuant to Section 412 or 413. If the determination of the department or the decision of the administrative law judge is finally reversed, no employer’s reserve account shall be charged with benefits paid pursuant to this subdivision, except as provided in Section 1026 or if the department determines pursuant to Section 1026.1 that the employer’s reserve account should not be credited.



######### 1336.  
The director or any party to a decision by an administrative law judge may appeal to the appeals board from the decision. The appeals board may order the taking of additional evidence and may affirm, reverse, modify, or set aside the decision of the administrative law judge. The appeals board shall promptly notify the director and the parties to any appeal of its order or decision.



######### 1337.  
The decision of the appeals board on an appeal from the decision of an administrative law judge must be rendered within 60 days after the submission of the appeal unless the board requires the taking of further evidence. If the appeals board requires the taking of further evidence, the hearing shall be commenced within 60 days after the submission of the appeal, and the decision of the board shall be mailed within 60 days after completion of the hearing.



######### 1338.  
If the appeals board issues a decision allowing benefits the benefits shall be paid regardless of any further action taken by the director, the appeals board, or any other administrative agency, and regardless of any appeal or mandamus, or other proceeding in the courts. If the decision of the appeals board is finally reversed or set aside, no employer’s account shall be charged with the benefits paid pursuant to this section, except as provided in Section 1026, or if the department determines pursuant to Section 1026.1 that the employer’s reserve account should not be credited.



######### 1339.  
(a) (1) The department shall pay unemployment compensation benefits through public employment offices or such other agency as may be prescribed by authorized regulations of the director.

(2) Beginning January 1, 2024, the department shall provide a person entitled to receive unemployment compensation benefits the option to receive payments by direct deposit, as regulated under the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1693 et seq.), into a qualifying account, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 1339.1, of the recipient’s choice, in addition to other alternative disbursement payment methods, including, but not limited to, debit cards and checks. 

(b) Each check or certification (pay order) issued in payment of unemployment insurance compensation benefits shall have prominently imprinted upon it: “State unemployment insurance benefits under the California Unemployment Insurance Code are paid for by employers.”



######### 1339.1.  
(a) (1) Notwithstanding this part, if unemployment compensation benefit payments are directly deposited to an account of the recipient’s choice, as authorized under the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1693 et seq.), the payments may only be deposited to an account that meets the requirements of a qualifying account, as defined in paragraph (2), for deposit of public assistance payments, including unemployment compensation benefits.

(2) For purposes of this section, a “qualifying account” is one of the following:

(A) A demand deposit or savings account at an insured depository financial institution that is offered directly by the insured depository financial institution on its internet website or through its branches and that is in the name of the person entitled to receipt of public assistance payments.

(B) A prepaid account, or a demand deposit or savings account offered by, or through, an entity other than an insured depository financial institution, that meets all of the following:

(i) The account is held at an insured depository financial institution.

(ii) The account is set up to meet the requirements for direct or passthrough deposit or share insurance payable to the person entitled to the receipt of public assistance payments by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in accordance with Part 330 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund in accordance with Part 745 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

(iii) The account is not attached to a credit or overdraft feature that is automatically repaid from the account unless the credit or overdraft feature has no fee, charge, or cost, whether direct, required, voluntary, or involuntary, or the credit or overdraft feature complies with the requirements for credit offered in connection with a prepaid account under the federal Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1601 et seq.) and its implementing regulations.

##### ARTICLE 4. Overpayments [1375 - 1384]  

######### 1375.  
Any person who is overpaid any amount of benefits under this part is liable for the amount overpaid unless any of the following is applicable:

(a) (1) The overpayment was not due to fraud, misrepresentation or willful nondisclosure on the part of the recipient, and (2) the overpayment was received without fault on the part of the recipient, and its recovery would be against equity and good conscience.

(b) The person who received the overpayment cooperates with the department in an investigation that results in the assessment of a penalty under Section 1144 or the prosecution or other action taken to impose a penalty pursuant to Section 2121.

(c) The department determines that it is in the interest of justice to waive all or part of the liability established under this section because the overpayment was a direct result of inducement, solicitation, or coercion on the part of the employer.



######### 1375.1.  
If the director finds that an individual has been overpaid unemployment compensation benefits because he or she willfully, for the purpose of obtaining unemployment compensation benefits, either made a false statement or representation, with actual knowledge of the falsity thereof, or withheld a material fact, the director shall assess against the individual an amount equal to 30 percent of the overpayment amount. Assessments collected under this section shall be deposited in the following manner:

(a) For penalty assessments established prior to October 22, 2013, 100 percent of the overpayment penalty amount in the Benefit Audit Fund.

(b) For penalty assessments established on or after October 22, 2013, as follows:

(1) 50 percent of the overpayment penalty amount in the Unemployment Trust Fund.

No determination of overpayment shall be based upon the disallowance by the Workmen’s Compensation Appeals Board of a claim of lien filed under subdivision (g) of Section 4903 of the Labor Code, or the allowance of such lien for less than the amount claimed as a lien, or upon the approval by the said appeals board of a compromise and release agreement providing for the allowance of such lien in an amount less than the amount claimed as a lien.



######### 1375.5.  
Any claim of lien filed with the Workmen’s Compensation Appeals Board under the provisions of Section 4903 of the Labor Code shall be fully discharged and satisfied by payment of the amount of such lien allowed by the said appeals board under the provisions of Section 4904 of said code or the amount specified in any compromise and release agreement filed and approved by the said appeals board pursuant to Sections 5000 through 5004 of said code.



######### 1375.7.  
The director shall find that an individual has been overpaid unemployment benefits where the individual was an elected official and the individual’s unemployment insurance claim was based on income solely derived from his or her employment as an elected official. An individual who is liable pursuant to this section shall not be eligible for waiver of the overpayment pursuant to Section 1375. In the event of an unemployment insurance claim based on more than one source of income, if the base period of a new claim includes any wage credits earned as an elected official pursuant to Section 634.5, the individual shall be liable for any amount of unemployment insurance benefits overpaid as a result of a recomputation to remove the base period wage credits earned as an elected official. In that event, the provisions of Section 1375 shall not apply to this section with respect to the wage credits earned as an elected official.



######### 1376.  
The Director of Employment Development shall determine the amount of the overpayment and any assessment authorized under Section 1375.1 and shall notify the liable person of the basis of the overpayment determination.

The director shall be an interested party to any such appeal. The administrative law judge, after affording reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing, shall, unless the appeal is withdrawn, affirm, reverse, modify, or set aside the findings set forth in the notice of overpayment. The party and the director shall be notified of the administrative law judge’s decision, together with his or her reasons therefor, which shall be final unless within 30 days from the date of notification or mailing of the decision a further appeal is initiated to the appeals board pursuant to Section 1336. The 30-day period for an appeal to the administrative law judge or to the appeals board may be extended for good cause.

(b) “Good cause,” as used in this section, shall include, but not be limited to, mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 

(c) This section shall become operative on July 1, 2015.



######### 1378.  
The Appeals Board shall review an appeal from an overpayment determination as provided in Sections 1336 and 1337 and determine what amount, if any, shall be recovered.



######### 1379.  
The director, subject to this article, may do any or all of the following in the recovery of overpayments of unemployment compensation benefits:

(a) File a civil action against the liable person for the recovery of the amount of the overpayment within one year after any of the following, or, in cases where the individual has been overpaid benefits due to fraud, misrepresentation, or nondisclosure as described in Section 1375.1, or where the director has found an overpayment pursuant to Section 1375.7, within three years of any of the following:

(1) The service of the notice of overpayment determination if the person affected does not file an appeal to an administrative law judge.

(2) The mailing of the decision of the administrative law judge if the person affected does not initiate a further appeal to the appeals board.

(3) The date of the decision of the appeals board.

(b) Initiate proceedings for a summary judgment against the liable person.

The director may, not later than three years after the overpayment became final, file with the clerk of the proper court in the county from which the overpayment of benefits was paid or in the county in which the claimant resides, a certificate containing all of the following:

(1) The amount due, including any assessment made under Section 1375.1, plus interest from the date that the initial determination of overpayment was made pursuant to Section 1376.

(2) A statement that the director has complied with all the provisions of this article prior to the filing of the certificate.

(3) A request that judgment be entered against the liable person in the amount set forth in the certificate.

(c) Reduce or vacate a summary judgment by filing a certificate to that effect with the clerk of the proper court.

(d) Offset the amount of the overpayment received by the liable person against any amount of benefits to which they may become entitled under this division within six years of the date of the service of the notice of overpayment determination.



######### 1379.5.  
An abstract of judgment obtained pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 1379, or a copy thereof, may be recorded with the county recorder of any county. From the time of recording, the judgment shall constitute a lien against all real or personal property of the liable person in that county owned by the liable person at the time, or which the liable person may afterwards, but before the lien expires, acquire. The lien shall have the force, effect, and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for 10 years from the time of recording of the abstract of judgment obtained pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 1379, unless sooner released or otherwise discharged.

The lien may, within 10 years from the date of recording of the abstract of judgment or within 10 years from the date of the last extension of the lien in the manner provided in this section, be extended by recording a new abstract in the office of the county recorder of any county.  From the date of such recording, the lien shall be extended for 10 years unless sooner released or otherwise discharged.

Execution shall issue upon such a judgment upon request of the director in the same manner as execution may issue upon other judgments.  Sales shall be held under such execution as prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure.  In all proceedings under this section, the director or his or her authorized agents may act on behalf of the state.



######### 1379.6.  
(a) If an abstract has been recorded as provided in Section 1379.5, and the lien, including any interest, costs, and penalty, has been satisfied in full, the department shall, pursuant to Section 724.050 of the Code of Civil Procedure do all of the following:

(1) File an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment with the court.

(2) Serve an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment on the claimant. Service shall be made personally or by mail.

(3) Record an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment in the office of the county recorder where the abstract of judgment is recorded.

(c) If payment is made by check, any action specified in subdivision (a) shall not be required until the check has been paid by the financial institution upon which it was drawn.



######### 1380.  
No person shall be liable for the amount of benefits received where the benefits were paid pursuant to an administrative law judge’s decision which affirmed an initial determination or in accordance with a final decision of the appeals board, regardless of any further appeal. An employer’s experience rating account shall not be charged with any benefits erroneously or unlawfully paid, except as provided in Section 1026 or 1144.



######### 1381.  
The director shall enforce collection of any judgment obtained by the director under subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 1379. Amounts collected under this section shall be deposited in the fund from which the overpayment was made, except that the amounts collected to offset the costs of collections shall be deposited in the Unemployment Administration Fund and the amounts collected pursuant to Section 1375.1 shall be deposited as specified in that section.



######### 1382.  
No person shall be liable for the amount of benefits received for any period for which the person also received an award or settlement of backpay resulting from an action or grievance for wrongful discharge, if the amount of the backpay award or settlement was reduced by the amount of benefits received pursuant to this part. When the amount of the backpay award or settlement was reduced by the amount of benefits received, the employer shall pay to the Unemployment Fund an amount equal to the amount subtracted from the backpay award or settlement for benefits received by the person in order to reimburse the fund. When an individual has been awarded or receives backpay, the amount of the backpay shall constitute wages paid in the period for which it is awarded.

A mediator or arbitrator who is a party to the backpay award or settlement shall, within 30 days of the settlement, report to the department the name and address of the employer, the amount of benefits by which the award or settlement was reduced, and the name and social security number of the person who received the award or settlement.



######### 1383.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the Franchise Tax Board shall aid the department in the recovery of overpayments of unemployment compensation benefits pursuant to Section 1379 for up to six years after the date of the service of the notice of overpayment determination.

There shall be maintained within the fund three separate accounts:

(a) A clearing account.

######### 1527.  
Immediately after clearance, all money in the clearing account except interest on contributions, and penalties collected shall be deposited in or invested in the obligations of the Unemployment Trust Fund of the United States of America or its authorized agent to the credit of this State, any provisions of law in this State relating to the deposit, administration, release, or disbursement of money in the possession or custody of this State to the contrary notwithstanding. The amounts so deposited or invested shall be entered in the Unemployment Trust Fund Account.



######### 1528.  
The benefit account consists of all money requisitioned from this State’s account in the Unemployment Trust Fund, except money requisitioned for administration pursuant to Section 1528.5, and any money so requisitioned, except money requisitioned for administration pursuant to Section 1528.5, shall be transferred out of the Unemployment Trust Fund account into the benefit account.



######### 1528.5.  
(a) Money credited to the account of this state in the Unemployment Trust Fund by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America pursuant to Section 903 of the Social Security Act, as amended, may not be requisitioned from this state’s account or used except for the payment of benefits and for the payment of expenses incurred for the administration of this part.  Such money may be requisitioned pursuant to Section 1529 for the payment of benefits.  Such money may also be requisitioned and used for the payment of expenses incurred for the administration of this part but only pursuant to a specific appropriation by the Legislature and only if the expenses are incurred and the money is requisitioned after the enactment of an appropriation law which:

(1) Specifies the purposes for which such money is appropriated and the amounts appropriated therefor.

(2) Limits the period within which such money may be obligated to a period ending not more than two years after the date of the enactment of the appropriation law.

(b) Money appropriated pursuant to this section for the payment of expenses of administration shall be requisitioned as needed for the payment of obligations incurred under such appropriation and, upon requisition, shall be deposited in the Unemployment Administration Fund, but, until expended, shall remain a part of the Unemployment Fund.  The director and the Controller shall maintain a separate record of the deposit, obligation, expenditure, and return of funds so deposited.  Any money so deposited which will not be expended shall be returned promptly to the account of this state in the Unemployment Trust Fund.



######### 1529.  
Except as provided in Section 1528.5, money shall be requisitioned from this State’s account in the Unemployment Trust Fund solely for the payment of benefits and in accordance with authorized regulations. The director shall from time to time requisition from the Unemployment Trust Fund such amounts, not exceeding the amounts standing to this State’s account therein, as he deems necessary for the payment of benefits for a reasonable future period. Upon receipt thereof the Treasurer shall deposit such money in the benefit account of the Unemployment Fund. Any balance of money requisitioned from the Unemployment Trust Fund which remains unclaimed or unpaid in the benefit account after the expiration of the period for which such sums were requisitioned shall either be considered in preparing subsequent estimates and may be utilized for the payment of benefits during succeeding periods, or, in the discretion of the director, shall be redeposited with the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America, to the credit of this State’s account in the Unemployment Trust Fund.



######### 1530.  
The provisions of this article to the extent that they relate to the Unemployment Trust Fund, shall be operative only so long as that fund continues to exist and so long as the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America continues to maintain for this State a separate book account of all funds deposited therein by this State for benefit purposes, together with this State’s proportionate share of the earnings of the Unemployment Trust Fund, from which no other state nor the United States is permitted to make withdrawals. If and when such Unemployment Trust Fund ceases to exist, or such separate book account is no longer maintained, all money, properties, or securities therein, belonging to the Unemployment Fund of this State shall be transferred to the treasurer of the Unemployment Fund, who shall hold, invest, transfer, sell, deposit, and release such money, properties, or securities in a manner approved by the director in accordance with the provisions of this division. Such money shall be invested in bonds or other interest-bearing obligations of the United States of America or the State of California. Such investment shall at all times be so made that all the assets of the fund shall always be readily convertible into cash when needed for the payment of benefits. The Treasurer shall dispose of securities or other properties belonging to the Unemployment Fund only under the direction of the director.



######### 1531.  
The director shall, without presenting vouchers and itemized statements therefor, withdraw from the benefit account any sums which he deems necessary for the payment of benefits for a reasonable future period. The Controller shall draw his warrant for any claim presented by the director for the payment of benefits under this account and the Treasurer shall pay the warrant. Upon the withdrawal thereof, such sums shall be deposited in a benefit payment account in such bank, savings and loan association, or public depository and under such conditions as the director determines, with the approval of the Department of Finance. Such bank, savings and loan association, or public depository shall be one in which general funds of the state may be deposited, but no public deposit insurance charge or premium shall be paid out of the benefit payment account. The director may, out of funds available for administration, pay premiums on insurance for the protection of money in his possession.



######### 1532.  
Money in the benefit payment account shall be used solely to pay benefits pursuant to authorized regulations and no other disbursement shall be made therefrom, but amounts erroneously and illegally deposited in such account may be refunded therefrom, except that money credited to this State’s account pursuant to Section 903 of the Social Security Act, as amended, shall be used exclusively as provided in Section 1528.5. The procedure prescribed by such regulations shall be deemed to satisfy and shall be in lieu of any and all statutory requirements not contained in this division of specific appropriation or other form of release by state officers of money in their custody prior to expenditure which might otherwise be applicable to withdrawals from the benefit payment account. Any balance of money withdrawn from the benefit account which remains unclaimed or unpaid in the benefit payment account after the expiration of the period for which such sums were withdrawn shall be considered in preparing subsequent estimates and may be utilized for the payment of benefits during succeeding periods or, in the discretion of the director, shall be redeposited in the benefit account.



######### 1533.  
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, money in the clearing and benefit accounts may be deposited by the Treasurer, under the direction of the director, in any bank, savings and loan association, or public depositary in which public funds of the state may be deposited, but no public deposit insurance charge or premium shall be paid out of the fund. Money in the clearing and benefit accounts shall not be commingled with other state funds, but shall be maintained in a separate account on the books of the depositary. Such money shall be secured by the bank or public depositary to the same extent and in the same manner as required under Chapter 4, Part 2, Division 4, Title 2 of the Government Code if deposited in a bank or public depository, not a savings and loan association or to the same extent and in the same manner as required under Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 16600) of Part 2 of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code if deposited in a savings and loan association and collateral pledged shall be maintained in a separate custody account.



######### 1534.  
Refunds or judgments payable pursuant to this part, may be paid from the clearing account or from the benefit account with respect to any money erroneously deposited therein, upon warrants issued by the Controller under the direction of and in accordance with authorized regulations, except that money credited to this state’s account pursuant to Section 903 of the Social Security Act, as amended, shall be used exclusively as provided in Section 1528.5. Refunds of interest, penalties, and fines and interest payable on refunds and judgments pursuant to this division may not be paid from the benefit account but may be paid from the clearing account to the extent that interest, penalties, and fines collected are currently on deposit in that account.



######### 1535.  
During such time as the Federal Social Security Act and Federal Unemployment Tax Act are amended so as to remove the requirement that all money withdrawn from the Unemployment Fund be used solely in the payment of unemployment compensation, exclusive of expenses of administration, and for refunds of sums erroneously paid into such fund and refunds paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 3305(b) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, then notwithstanding any other provisions of this division to the contrary there is hereby continuously appropriated out of the Unemployment Fund for the purpose of administering this division, including salaries and other expenses of the department and the acquisition of necessary real property, all amounts collected under Section 993.



######### 1536.  
Any amounts determined by the director or his authorized representatives to be payable to employing units as refunds of contributions erroneously paid which are unclaimed at the end of three years from such determination shall be included in the revenue to the Unemployment Fund or in the case of interest or penalties, to the Contingent Fund. The employing unit or person entitled to such payment shall not thereafter maintain any claim, action or proceeding with respect to such amounts.



######### 1537.  
Whenever any warrant drawn on an account in the Unemployment Fund or on the Unemployment Administration Fund or the Contingent Fund by the Controller remains unclaimed after one year the amount thereof shall revert to the account and the fund from which the amount was payable.









##### ARTICLE 3. Administration Fund [1555 - 1562]

##### CHAPTER 9.5. Employment for Older Workers [2070 - 2078]  

######### 2070.  
It is the public policy of the State of California that manpower should be used to its fullest extent. This statement of policy compels the further conclusion that human beings seeking employment, or retention thereof, should be judged fairly and without resort to rigid and unsound rules that operate to disqualify significant portions of the population from gainful and useful employment.

The department shall carry on a continuing program of education, information, research, study, and community organization concerning the problems of older workers in seeking, obtaining, and holding employment without discrimination on account of age. The department shall create such local advisory agencies as in its judgment will aid in effectuating the purposes of this section, and may empower them to study the problems of discrimination on account of age and all problems relating to employment programs for older workers, and to foster through community effort co-operation among the various groups and elements of the population of the State and to make recommendations to the department for the development of policies and procedures to carry out the purposes of this section. Such advisory agencies shall be composed of representative citizens, serving without pay.

(a) Except as provided in this section, an individual is not eligible for disability benefits under this part for any day of unemployment and disability for which he or she has received, or is entitled to receive, “other benefits” in the form of cash payments.

(1) Temporary disability indemnity under a workers’ compensation law of this state or of any other state or of the federal government.

In addition, the employer shall pay the department interest on the disability benefits at the annual rate provided in Section 19521 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.  The employer shall also pay a penalty of 10 percent of the amount reimbursed to the department if the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board finds that the failure of the employer to pay other benefits upon notice by the department under this section was unreasonable and a penalty has not been awarded for the delay under Section 5814 of the Labor Code. All funds received by the department pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the Disability Fund.

(f) The employer shall reimburse the department in accordance with subdivision (e) within 60 days of either voluntarily accepting liability for other benefits or after a final award, order, or decision of the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board.

(c) If the department determines that an individual referred to in subdivision (a) has a claim for unemployment compensation disability benefits with an approved voluntary plan, it shall notify the voluntary plan payer. When the Department of Child Support Services notifies the department of any changes in the individual’s status as to his or her support obligations, the department shall in turn notify the voluntary plan payer.  Upon notification from the department, the voluntary plan payer shall deduct and withhold the amounts specified in Section 17518 of the Family Code from the unemployment compensation disability benefits that would otherwise be payable to the individual.  For each withholding, the voluntary plan payer shall deduct an amount which represents the amount withheld for support obligations and may also deduct an administrative fee representing actual costs, not to exceed two dollars ($2).  In no event shall the withholding and the administrative fee exceed 25 percent or a lesser amount as specified in subdivision (e) of Section 17518 of the Family Code.  The voluntary plan payer shall pay the amounts for support deducted and withheld pursuant to this section to the appropriate certifying county.

(e) Amounts deducted and withheld from an individual’s unemployment compensation disability benefits in accordance with subdivision (c) or (d) shall for all purposes be treated as if it were paid to the individual and then paid by the individual to the Department of Child Support Services or the appropriate certifying county.

(f) This section shall apply only if appropriate arrangements are made for the Department of Child Support Services to reimburse the department for its administrative costs for performing the functions required of it by this section.

(g) For purposes of this section, “support obligations” means the child and related spousal support obligations described in the state plan approved pursuant to Section 454 of the Social Security Act and as that section may hereafter be amended.  However, to the extent “related spousal support obligations” may not be collected from unemployment compensation under federal law, those obligations shall not be included in the definition of support obligations under this section.

A certificate filed to establish medical eligibility for the employee’s own sickness, injury, or pregnancy shall contain a diagnosis and diagnostic code prescribed in the International Classification of Diseases, or, if no diagnosis has yet been obtained, a detailed statement of symptoms.

(2) A certificate filed to establish medical eligibility of the employee’s own sickness, injury, or pregnancy shall also contain a statement of medical facts, including secondary diagnoses when applicable, within the physician’s or practitioner’s knowledge, based on a physical examination and a documented medical history of the claimant by the physician or practitioner, indicating the physician’s or practitioner’s conclusion as to the claimant’s disability, and a statement of the physician’s or practitioner’s opinion as to the expected duration of the disability.

(B) “Warrants the participation of the employee” includes, but is not limited to, providing psychological comfort, and arranging “third party” care for the child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or domestic partner, as well as directly providing, or participating in, the medical care.

(c) The department shall develop a certification form for bonding that is separate and distinct from the certificate required in subdivision (a) for an employee taking leave to bond with a minor child within the first year of the child’s birth or placement in connection with foster care or adoption.

(d) The first and any continuing claim of an individual who obtains care and treatment outside this state shall be supported by a certificate of a treating physician or practitioner duly licensed or certified by the state or foreign country in which the claimant is receiving the care and treatment. If a physician or practitioner licensed by and practicing in a foreign country is under investigation by the department for filing false claims and the department does not have legal remedies to conduct a criminal investigation or prosecution in that country, the department may suspend the processing of all further certifications until the physician or practitioner fully cooperates, and continues to cooperate, with the investigation.

######### 2709.  
If any individual in good faith adheres to the teachings of any bona fide church, sect, denomination or organization and in accordance with its principles depends for healing entirely upon prayer or spiritual means, no medical examination shall be required, but in lieu thereof the director may accept the certificate of a duly authorized and accredited practitioner of that bona fide church, sect, denomination or organization as to the disability of the claimant, or the serious health condition of the family member that warrants the care of the individual, for purposes of Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 3300) of Part 2, and the estimated duration of such disability, and no authorized regulation prescribing the manner of proof of illness, injury, or serious health condition shall discriminate against that individual.



######### 2712.  
Whenever an individual is entitled to benefits under this part but there is a dispute whether such benefits are payable from the Disability Fund or from one or another voluntary plan, benefits shall be paid to the individual, pursuant to authorized regulations, from the source against which his claim was first filed, at not less than the Disability Fund rate, pending the determination of the dispute. The appeals board may prescribe by regulation the time, manner, method, and procedure through which such disputes may be determined by administrative law judges and the appeals board. If it is finally determined that the benefits should have been paid from one of said sources other than the one which paid the benefits, reimbursement shall be promptly made from the Disability Fund or the voluntary plan, as the case may be, and the claimant shall be promptly paid the accumulated excess, if any, to which he is entitled. Reimbursement shall also be made to the extent of actual liability for benefits from one to another of the above mentioned sources when it is determined that benefits have been paid in error from one source which should have been paid from another.

The provisions of Article 8 (commencing with Section 1126) of Chapter 4 of Part 1 with respect to the assessment of contributions shall apply to the recovery of the unpaid amount.  The provisions of Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 1701) of Part 1 with respect to the collection of contributions shall apply to the recovery of unpaid amounts under this section.  Amounts so collected shall be deposited in the Disability Fund.

(b) The provisions of Article 9 (commencing with Section 1176) of Chapter 4 of Part 1 shall apply to amounts collected under this section and to amounts reimbursed to the Disability Fund after a final decision by an administrative law judge or the appeals board in a disputed coverage proceeding under Section 2712.



######### 2713.  
In proceedings under this part the claimant, upon a showing of good cause, may request a closed hearing except that the last employer and each base period employer of the claimant shall be entitled to participate in any such hearing.

For the purpose of collection, an assessment made pursuant to this section may be treated as an overpayment. Assessments collected under this section shall be deposited in the Unemployment Compensation Disability Fund. No penalty under this section shall be assessed with regard to any false statement or representation made prior to January 1, 1986.



######### 2735.5.  
No claim of overpayment shall be based upon the disallowance by the Workmen’s Compensation Appeals Board of a claim of lien filed under Section 4903 of the Labor Code, or the allowance of such lien for less than the amount claimed, or upon the approval by the said appeals board of a compromise and release agreement providing for the allowance of such lien in an amount less than the claim.

The notice shall be filed in writing with the Director of Employment Development and shall be effective only on the anniversary of the effective date of the plan next following the filing of the notice, but in any event not less than 30 days from the time of the filing of the notice; except that the plan may be withdrawn on the operative date of any law increasing the benefit amounts provided by Sections 2653 and 2655 or the operative date of any change in the rate of worker contributions as determined by Section 984, if notice of the withdrawal from the plan is transmitted to the Director of Employment Development not less than 30 days prior to the operative date of that law or change.  If the plan is not withdrawn on the 30 days’ notice because of the enactment of a law increasing benefits or because of a change in the rate of worker contributions as determined by Section 984, the plan shall be amended to conform to that increase or change on the operative date of the increase or change.

(h) The amount of deductions from the wages of an employee in effect for any plan shall not be increased on other than an anniversary of the effective date of the plan except to the extent that any increase in the deductions from the wages of an employee allowed by Section 3260 permits that amount to exceed the amount of deductions in effect.

(i) The approval of the plan or plans will not result in a substantial selection of risks adverse to the Disability Fund.

######### 3254.5.  
A voluntary plan in force and effect at the time a successor employing unit acquires the organization, trade, or business, or substantially all the assets thereof, or a distinct and severable portion of the organization, trade, or business, and continues its operation without substantial reduction of personnel resulting from the acquisition, shall not withdraw without specific request for withdrawal thereof. The successor employing unit and the insurer shall be deemed to have consented to the provisions of the plan unless written request for withdrawal, effective as of the date of acquisition, is transmitted to the Director of Employment Development, by the employer or the insurer, within 30 days after the acquisition date, or within 30 days after notification from the Director of Employment Development that the plan is to continue, whichever is later. Unless the plan is withdrawn as of the date of acquisition by the successor employer or the insurer, a written request for withdrawal shall be effective only on the anniversary of the effective date of the plan next occurring on or after the date of acquisition, except that the plan may be withdrawn on the operative date of any law increasing the benefit amounts provided by Sections 2653 and 2655 or the operative date of any change in the rate of worker contributions as determined by Section 984, if notice of the withdrawal of the plan is transmitted to the Director of Employment Development not less than 30 days prior to the operative date of law or change. If the plan is not withdrawn on 30 days’ notice because of the enactment of a law increasing benefits or because of a change in the rate of worker contributions as determined by Section 984, the plan shall be amended to conform to the increase or change on the operative date of the increase or change. Promptly, upon notice of change in ownership, any insurer of a plan shall prepare and issue policy forms and amendments as required, unless the plan is withdrawn. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent future withdrawal of any plans on an anniversary of the effective date of the plan upon 30 days’ notice, except that the plan may be withdrawn on the operative date of any law increasing the benefit amounts provided by Sections 2653 and 2655 or the operative date of any change in the rate of worker contributions as determined by Section 984, if notice of the withdrawal of the plan is transmitted to the Director of Employment Development not less than 30 days prior to the operative date of the law or change. If the plan is not withdrawn on 30 days’ notice because of the enactment of a law increasing benefits or because of a change in the rate of worker contributions as determined by Section 984, the plan shall be amended to conform to the increase or change on the operative date of the increase or change.



######### 3255.  
When workers are engaged in an employment that normally involves working for several employers in the same industry interchangeably, and several employers or some of them cooperate to establish a plan for the payment of wages at a central place or places, and have appointed an agent under Section 1096, that agent, or a majority of workers regularly paid through a central place or places, or both, may apply to the Director of Employment Development for approval of a voluntary plan for the payment of disability benefits applicable to all employees whose wages are paid at one or more central place or places.  The Director of Employment Development shall approve any voluntary plan under this section as to which he or she finds that all of the following exist:

(a) The rights afforded to the covered employees are greater than those provided for in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 2625) of this part, and are separately stated and designated “unemployment compensation disability benefits” separate and distinct from other benefits, if any.

(b) The plan applies to all employees whose wages are paid at a central place or places with respect to all employment for which wages are paid at central place or places.

(c) Seventy-five percent of the workers regularly paid at the central place or places have consented to the plan prior to the filing of the initial application for approval.

(d) If the plan provides for insurance the form of the insurance policies to be issued have been approved by the Insurance Commissioner and are to be issued by an admitted disability insurer.

(e) All employers paying wages through the central place or places have agreed to participate in the plan and the agent appointed under Section 1096 has agreed to make the payroll deductions required, if any, and transmit the proceeds to the plan insurer, if any.

(f) The plan provides for the inclusion of all future employees paid at the central place or places.

(g) The plan is to be in effect for a period of not less than one year and, thereafter, continuously unless the Director of Employment Development finds that the agent or a majority of the employees regularly paid at the central place or places has given written notice of withdrawal from the plan.  The notice shall be filed in writing with the Director of Employment Development at least 30 days before it is to become effective and, upon the filing, will be effective only as to wages paid after the beginning of the calendar quarter next occurring on or after the anniversary of the effective date of the plan; except that the plan may be withdrawn on the operative date of any law increasing the benefit amounts provided by Sections 2653 and 2655 or the operative date of any change in the rate of worker contributions as determined by Section 984, if notice of the withdrawal from the plan is transmitted to the Director of Employment Development not less than 30 days prior to the operative date of that law or change.  If the plan is not withdrawn on 30 days’ notice because of the enactment of a law increasing benefits or because of a change in the rate of worker contributions as determined by Section 984, the plan shall be amended to conform to  that increase or change on the operative date of the increase or change.

(h) The amount of deductions from the wages of an employee in effect for any plan shall not be increased on other than an anniversary of the effective date of the plan except to the extent that any increase in the deductions from the wages of an employee allowed by Section 3260 permits  that amount to exceed the amount of deductions in effect.

(i) The approval of the plan or plans will not result in a substantial selection of risks adverse to the Disability Fund.



######### 3256.  
During the effective period of a plan approved under Section 3255 the employer, or his agent appointed under Section 1096, may make the pay roll deductions provided for by the plan, with respect to all employment covered by the plan.



######### 3257.  
Whenever eighty-five percent (85%) of the employees to whom a plan is available have consented to the plan, the employer, or seventy-five percent (75%) of the employees who have consented to the plan, or both, may elect to make the plan applicable to all employees to whom it is available, except those who reject the plan. In such case, there shall be filed with the Director of Employment Development a notice stating that the requisite percentage of employees has consented to the plan and fixing the date upon which the plan will become applicable to all employees to whom it is available. At least 10 days before the date fixed in the notice, a notice shall be posted and circulated in a manner reasonably calculated to bring it to the attention of all employees to whom the plan is available but who have not consented thereto. The notice to such employees shall set forth the date the plan is to become applicable and the manner in which an employee may reject it.

From the time fixed in the notice filed with the Director of Employment Development all employees to whom the plan is available shall be deemed to have elected to be covered by the plan, except those who advise the employer in writing of their rejection within the time fixed.

Every person employed after the date the plan becomes applicable and to whom the plan is available, shall be deemed to have elected to be covered by the plan from the time of employment unless he rejects the plan prior to or at the time of employment.  Each employee at the time of employment shall be given a written notice specifying his right to consent to or to reject such plan and a written statement setting forth the essential features of the plan.

Any employee covered by a plan may withdraw from the plan as of the beginning of any calendar quarter upon giving reasonable notice in writing directed to the employer.

The form of the statement and the forms of the notices required under this Section shall be approved by the Director of Employment Development.



######### 3258.  
If a voluntary plan does not provide for the assumption by an admitted disability insurer of the liability of the employer to pay the benefits afforded by the plan, the director shall not approve it unless the employer files with the director the bond of an admitted surety insurer conditioned on the payment by the employer of its obligations under the plan, deposits with the director securities approved by the director to secure the payment of the obligations, or deposits with the director an irrevocable letter of credit. The penal sum of the bond or the amount of the deposit of securities or letter of credit shall be determined by the director and shall be not less than the product obtained by multiplying the rate of worker contributions in the ensuing year, as determined in Section 984, by 0.5 of the estimated taxable wages prescribed by Section 985 to be paid to the employees for the ensuing year. Upon approval, the bond, money, or securities shall upon the director’s written order be deposited with the Treasurer for the purpose specified in this section. The Treasurer shall give a receipt for the deposits and the state shall be responsible for the custody and safe return of any securities so deposited.



######### 3259.  
Whenever an approved voluntary plan is insured by an admitted disability insurer, the insurer shall be substituted for the employer with respect to any assessments under this part which relate to the portion of the voluntary plan insured by such insurer.



######### 3260.  
An employer may, but need not, assume all or part of the cost of the plan, and may deduct from the wages of an employee covered by the plan, for the purpose of providing the disability benefits specified in this part, an amount not in excess of that which would be required by Sections 984 and 985 if the employee were not covered by the plan.



######### 3260.5.  
(a) All deductions from the wages of an employee remaining in the possession of the employer upon its voluntary withdrawal of the plan as a result of plan contributions being in excess of plan costs, that are not disposed of in conformity with authorized regulations of the Director of Employment Development, shall be remitted to the department and deposited in the Disability Fund.  If an employer fails to remit any deductions to the Disability Fund, the Director of Employment Development shall assess the amount thereof against the employer.

(b) The provisions of Article 8 (commencing with Section 1126) of Chapter 4 of Part 1, with respect to the assessment of contributions, and the provisions of Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 1701) of Part 1, with respect to the collection of contributions, shall apply to assessments provided by this section, except that interest may not accrue until 30 days after issuance of the notice of assessment.

(c) With respect to individuals covered by a voluntary plan on January 1 of any calendar year for which the limitation on wages under Section 985 is increased or the tax rate under Section 984 is increased, the amount of the deduction on or after that date may be increased to apply to not more than the maximum limitation on taxable wages or to not more than the maximum tax rate, as applicable, without any further consent of the individual or approval of the Director of Employment Development, but only if such increase in the amount of the deductions is made effective as of January 1 of the affected calendar year.



######### 3261.  
All employee contributions and income arising therefrom received or retained by an employer under an approved voluntary plan are trust funds that are not considered to be part of an employer’s assets.  An employer shall either maintain a separate, specifically identifiable account for voluntary plan trust funds in a financial institution, or an employer may transmit voluntary plan trust funds, including any earned interest or income, directly to the admitted disability insurer.  If an employer, with prior approval from the Director of Employment Development, invests voluntary plan trust funds in securities purchased through a commercial bank under Article 4 of Chapter 10 of Division 1 of the Financial Code, the securities account shall be separately identifiable from any other securities accounts maintained by the employer.  In the event of commingling of voluntary plan trust funds, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of the employer, or the appointment of a receiver for the business of the employer, those voluntary plan trust funds are entitled to the same preference as are the claims of the state under Sections 1701 and 1702.



######### 3262.  
(a) The Director of Employment Development may terminate any voluntary plan if the director finds that there is danger that the benefits accrued or to accrue will not be paid, that the security for the payment is insufficient, or for other good cause shown. The Director of Employment Development shall give notice of their intention to terminate a plan to the employer, employee group, and insurer. The notice shall state the effective date and the reason for the withdrawal. The Director of Employment Development may change or stay the effective date of the termination.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 3260.5, on the effective date of the termination of a plan by the Director of Employment Development, all moneys in the plan, including moneys paid by the employer, moneys paid by the employee, moneys owed to the voluntary plan by the employer but not yet paid to the plan, and any interest accrued on all these moneys, shall be remitted to the department and deposited into the Disability Fund.

(c) If an employer fails to remit all moneys owed to the Disability Fund after termination of the plan, the Director of Employment Development shall make an assessment against the employer equal to the amount of the moneys owed. The Director of Employment Development shall also make an assessment against the employer for all benefits paid from the Disability Fund after the termination of the plan, less any moneys received from the employer after the termination of the plan.

(d) The provisions of Article 8 (commencing with Section 1126) of Chapter 4 of Part 1, with respect to the assessment of moneys, and the provisions of Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 1701) of Part 1, with respect to the collection of moneys owed, shall apply to assessments authorized under this section, except that interest may not accrue until 30 days after issuance of the notice of assessment.

(e) The employer, employee group or insurer may, within 10 days from service of the notice, appeal to the Appeals Board. The 10-day period may be extended for good cause. The Appeals Board may prescribe by regulation the time, manner, method and procedure through which it may determine appeals under this section.

(f) The payment of benefits from the Disability Fund and the transfer of moneys in the voluntary plan may not be delayed during an employer’s appeal of the termination of a voluntary plan.



######### 3263.  
(a) An employee is no longer covered by an approved voluntary plan if a disability arose after the employment relationship with the voluntary plan employer ends, or if the Director of Employment Development terminates a voluntary plan in accordance with Section 3262.

(b) An employee who has ceased to be covered by an approved voluntary plan shall, if otherwise eligible, thereupon immediately become entitled to benefits from the Disability Fund to the same extent as though there had been no exemption from contributions as provided in this chapter.



######### 3264.  
If any employer or insurer wholly or partially denies liability upon the claim of an employee for disability benefits under an approved plan, the employee may appeal the denial in the manner provided by law and authorized regulations for an appeal on a claim for benefits payable out of the Disability Fund. All decisions of the Appeals Board denying benefits under this section shall be subject to review by the courts of this State by the exclusive remedy of filing a petition for writ of mandate. No such petition may be filed, however, until the employee exhausts the administrative remedies provided for in this division, nor may any other action be commenced by an employee upon a denial of his claim by his employer or insurer, as the case may be, other than that prescribed herein.



######### 3265.  
(a) If, on appeal, it is decided that an employee is entitled to receive disability benefits under an approved voluntary plan and the employer or insurer fails to pay the same within 15 days after notice of a decision by an administrative law judge or the appeals board, the director shall pay such benefits and shall assess the amount thereof against the employer or the insurer, and the provisions of Article 8 (commencing with Section 1126) of Chapter 4 of Part 1 of this division with respect to the assessment of contributions and the provisions of Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 1701) of Part 1 of this division with respect to the collection of contributions shall apply to the recovery of such benefit payments.  Amounts so collected shall be deposited in the Disability Fund.

(b) If an approved voluntary plan is not terminated because of the enactment of any law increasing the benefit amounts provided by Sections 2653 and 2655, and the employer or insurer fails to pay such increase under the plan, the director shall pay such benefits to an employee, if otherwise eligible, and shall assess the amount thereof against the employer or the insurer and the provisions of Article 8 (commencing with Section 1126) of Chapter 4 of Part 1 of this division with respect to the assessment of contributions and the provisions of Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 1701) of Part 1 of this division with respect to the collection of contributions shall apply to the recovery of such benefit payments.  Amounts so collected shall be deposited in the Disability Fund.



######### 3266.  
The director shall in accordance with his or her authorized regulations determine the portion of the aggregate amount of refunds and credits to employees made under Section 1176 during any calendar year which is applicable to voluntary plans for which deductions were made under Section 3260, such determination to be based upon the relation during the preceding calendar year of the amount of wages subject to contributions to the Disability Fund to the amount of wages exempt from contributions to the Disability Fund under Section 3252.



######### 3267.  
Employers whose employees are participating in an approved voluntary plan and any insurer of an approved plan shall furnish such reports and information and make available to the department such records as the director may by authorized regulations require for the proper administration of this part.



######### 3268.  
The Director of Employment Development shall, in accordance with his authorized regulations, promptly furnish to employers, employees, or insurers, such information as may be required for the proper administration of an approved voluntary plan.



######### 3269.  
The director shall in accordance with his or her authorized regulations, determine each fiscal year the total amount expended for added administrative work arising out of voluntary plans.



######### 3270.  
The provisions of subdivision (i) of Section 3254 and subdivision (i) of Section 3255, dealing with substantial selection of risks adverse to the Disability Fund, shall be operative as of January 1, 1962.



######### 3271.  
(a) The director shall approve any amendment to a voluntary plan adjusting the provisions thereof as to periods after the effective date of the amendment as to which he or she finds that the plan, as amended, will conform to the standards set forth in Section 3254, and that any of the following exist:

(1) A majority of the employees covered by the plan have consented in writing to the amendment.

(2) All of the employees covered by the plan who are adversely affected by the amendment have consented in writing to the amendment.

(3) The insurer of such plan, if any, has certified to the director that notice of the amendment either separately or as a part of a new certificate or statement of coverage, has, at least 10 days prior to the effective date of the proposed amendment, been delivered to the employer for distribution to his or her employees within 10 days thereafter and has further certified that such notice specifically included notification to the employees covered by the plan of their right to withdraw from the plan.

(b) Nothing contained in this section is intended to deny or limit the right of the director to make regulations supplementary thereto, nor on the general subject of requirements for amendments of voluntary plans.



######### 3272.  
The provisions of Article 9 (commencing with Section 1176) of Chapter 4 of Part 1 of this division shall apply to amounts collected under Sections 3252, 3260, and 3265, to amounts remitted to the Disability Fund under Section 3260, and to amounts paid to an employee by an employer or insurer after a final decision on appeal under Section 3264 to an administrative law judge or the appeals board that the employee is entitled to disability benefits.








##### CHAPTER 7. Paid Family Leave [3300 - 3308]  

######### 3300.  
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) It is in the public benefit to provide family temporary disability insurance benefits to workers to care for their family members. The need for family temporary disability insurance benefits has intensified as the participation of both parents in the workforce has increased, and the number of single parents in the workforce has grown. The need for partial wage replacement for workers taking family care leave will be exacerbated as the population of those needing care, both children and parents of workers, increases in relation to the number of working age adults.

(b) Family Temporary Disability Insurance shall be known as Paid Family Leave.

(c) Developing systems that help families adapt to the competing interests of work and home not only benefits workers, but also benefits employers by increasing worker productivity and reducing employee turnover.

(d) The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and California’s Family Rights Act (CFRA) entitle eligible employees working for covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for up to 12 workweeks in a 12-month period. Under the FMLA and the CFRA, unpaid leave may be taken for the birth, adoption, or foster placement of a new child; to care for a seriously ill child, parent, or spouse; or for the employee’s own serious health condition.

(e) State disability insurance benefits currently provide wage replacement for workers who need time off due to their own nonwork-related injuries, illnesses, or conditions, including pregnancy, that prevent them from working, but do not cover leave to care for a sick or injured child, spouse, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or domestic partner, or leave to bond with a new child.

(f) The majority of workers in this state are unable to take family care leave because they are unable to afford leave without pay. When workers do not receive some form of wage replacement during family care leave, families suffer from the worker’s loss of income, increasing the demand on the state unemployment insurance system and dependence on the state’s welfare system.

(g) It is the intent of the Legislature to create a family temporary disability insurance program to help reconcile the demands of work and family. The family temporary disability insurance program shall be a component of the state’s unemployment compensation disability insurance program, shall be funded through employee contributions, and shall be administered in accordance with the policies of the state disability insurance program created pursuant to this part. Initial and ongoing administrative costs associated with the family temporary disability insurance program shall be payable from the Disability Fund.



######### 3301.  
(a) (1) The purpose of this chapter is to establish, within the state disability insurance program, a family temporary disability insurance program. Family temporary disability insurance shall provide up to eight weeks of wage replacement benefits to workers who take time off work to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or domestic partner, to bond with a minor child within one year of the birth or placement of the child in connection with foster care or adoption, or to participate in a qualifying exigency related to the covered active duty or call to covered active duty of the individual’s spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent in the Armed Forces of the United States.

(2) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to abridge the rights and responsibilities conveyed under the CFRA or pregnancy disability leave.

(b) (1) An individual’s “weekly benefit amount” for periods of disability commencing before January 1, 2025, shall be the amount provided in Section 2655, and for periods of disability commencing on or after January 1, 2025, shall be the amount provided in paragraph (2). An individual is eligible to receive family temporary disability insurance benefits equal to one-seventh of the individual’s weekly benefit amount for each full day during which the individual is unable to work due to caring for a seriously ill or injured family member, bonding with a minor child within one year of the birth or placement of the child in connection with foster care or adoption, or participating in a qualifying exigency related to the covered active duty or call to covered active duty of the individual’s spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent in the Armed Forces of the United States.

(2) For periods of disability commencing on or after January 1, 2025, the weekly benefit amount shall be as follows:

(A) When the amount of wages paid to the individual for employment by employers during the quarter of the individual’s disability base period in which these wages were highest is less than seven hundred twenty-two dollars and fifty cents ($722.50), then fifty dollars ($50).

(B) When the amount of wages paid to the individual for employment by employers during the quarter of the individual’s disability base period in which these wages were highest is more than 70 percent of the state average quarterly wage, the weekly benefit amount shall be equal to the greater of 70 percent of the wages paid to an individual for employment by employers during the quarter of the individual’s disability base period in which these wages were highest, divided by 13, but not exceeding the maximum workers’ compensation temporary disability indemnity weekly benefit amount established by the Department of Industrial Relations pursuant to Section 4453 of the Labor Code, or 63 percent of the state average weekly wage.

(C) When the amount of wages paid to the individual for employment by employers during the quarter of the individual’s disability base period in which these wages were highest is seven hundred twenty-two dollars and fifty cents ($722.50) or more, but 70 percent or less than the state average quarterly wage, then the weekly benefit amount shall be equal to 90 percent of the wages paid to an individual for employment by employers during the quarter of the individual’s disability base period in which these wages were highest, divided by 13, but not exceeding the maximum workers’ compensation temporary disability indemnity weekly benefit amount established by the Department of Industrial Relations pursuant to Section 4453 of the Labor Code.

(3) For purposes of this subdivision, “state average weekly wage” and “state average quarterly wage” have the same meanings as defined in subdivision (g) of Section 2655.

(c) The maximum amount payable to an individual during any disability benefit period for family temporary disability insurance shall be eight times the individual’s “weekly benefit amount,” but in no case shall the total amount of benefits payable be more than the total wages paid to the individual during the individual’s disability base period. If the benefit is not a multiple of one dollar ($1), it shall be computed to the next higher multiple of one dollar ($1).

(d) No more than eight weeks of family temporary disability insurance benefits shall be paid within any 12-month period.

(e) An individual shall file a claim for family temporary disability insurance benefits not later than the 41st consecutive day following the first compensable day with respect to which the claim is made for benefits, which time shall be extended by the department upon a showing of good cause. If a first claim is not complete, the claim form shall be returned to the claimant for completion and it shall be completed and returned not later than the 10th consecutive day after the date it was mailed by the department to the claimant, except that such time shall be extended by the department upon a showing of good cause.

######### 9000.  
The Legislature hereby makes the following declaration of purpose and intent in enacting the Employment Development Act of 1973.

It is the public policy of the State of California to provide for comprehensive statewide and local manpower planning, to improve the efficiency of, and the accountability for, delivery systems for manpower programs, to promptly place job-ready individuals in suitable jobs, to provide qualified job applicants to employers, to assist potentially employable individuals to become job ready, and to create employment opportunities.



######### 9001.  
In enacting the Employment Development Act of 1973, the Legislature further finds and declares that it is essential to the health and welfare of the people of this state that action be taken by local, state and federal governments to effectively and economically utilize public funds for job training and placement services. To achieve this, it is necessary that:

(a) Explicit priorities be established for the allocation of these funds to ensure that they are first used to assist those in greatest need for job training and placement services;

(b) Definitive goals be established for the total system of job training and placement services to maximize the effectiveness of the system in assisting individuals to find and maintain gainful, competitive employment;

(c) Efforts be made to enlist the full support of private industry in securing jobs for enrollees of training programs, and a closer, more integrated and coordinated effort be established with the federal government as well as state and local public and private agencies involved in performing job training and placement services; and

It is hereby declared to be the intent of the Legislature to concentrate and account for the funds available for job training and placement services in one state agency whose functions shall be subject to periodic review by the Legislature and appropriate federal agencies, and to which is assigned the responsibility for the efficient administration of job training and placement services in this state and the allocation of these funds to the end that such funds will be more effectively utilized and will be directed primarily to those areas of the state with the largest concentrations of chronically unemployed persons.

It is the further intent of the Legislature (a) to maintain policy control over all job training and placement programs administered by the department pursuant to this part to the maximum extent feasible, consistent with effective program operations, (b) to organize existing job training and placement programs now operating in the state into a coordinated system designed to remove employable persons from dependency on public assistance, and to enlist the full support of private industry in securing jobs, (c) to use funds for job training and placement services in a flexible manner to provide needed services for individuals through contractual arrangements with public and private agencies, (d) to provide a unified system for timely delivery of improved job training placement and related services to eligible persons including individual case responsibility, an outreach effort to seek out those persons who need but do not apply for services, followup to insure that the needs of eligible persons and their families are met, dissemination of information and knowledge to residents of the economically disadvantaged area about available services, and location of services in areas readily accessible to those who need them, and (e) to involve members of each community in identifying the needs to be met and relating them to the services available in order to reduce the isolation of the disadvantaged from their government and the community as a whole and to improve their confidence in government at all levels.

Subject to the provisions of Sections 9600 and 9605, the Secretary of the Health and Welfare Agency shall coordinate all job training placement, and related programs, conducted by state agencies, with the federal government and ensure that there is no duplication of the programs among state agencies and that all agreements, contracts, plans, or programs conform to the provisions of this part.

######### 9004.  
Upon receipt of a formal ruling from the United States Secretary of Labor, the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the head of any federal agency that any provision of Chapter 1206 of the Statutes of 1973 or Chapter 1212 of the Statutes of 1973 cannot be given effect without causing the state’s plan to be out of conformity with federal requirements or would result in decertification of provisions of this code and notification of intention to withdraw federal funds from the state, that provision shall become inoperative to the extent that it is not in conformity with federal requirements.

(3) Despite the specialized nature of emerging biotechnology firms, their recent growth has been extensive, and with that growth has come an ever-increasing demand for trained biotechnology workers at all levels.  The industry’s workforce has grown at an annual rate of about 15 percent over the past five years, and California’s biotechnology workforce could easily grow to over 250,000 by the year 2015 from its current level of 100,000.

(4) Biotechnology employers need entry-level and advanced professionals that have a background in, and familiarity with, industrylike conditions for basic, applied, and translational research, development, and production.  Based on recent studies, there is a clear and strong demand for applied bioscience training, but that demand is currently not being met by the region’s universities and colleges.

(5) Companies nationally have overwhelmingly endorsed an “industry-focused” approach of providing internship training programs directly with the companies, combined with “company-like” training activities.

(6) Many firms have identified the difficulty in finding entry level biotechnology workers at both the graduate and undergraduate levels as being directly related to the students’ lack of applied industry training or exposure.  Many firms have had to extensively train new employees to teach them how to function in a biotechnology business environment.  Additionally, nearly three-fourths of firms surveyed in San Diego and nationally have indicated that they would benefit from being able to hire workers that have been prepared to enter the workforce through advanced biotechnology internships and training of a “specific” nature.

(7) San Diego and the surrounding area is served by many well-recognized academic institutions, from community colleges to universities offering doctorate programs, that supply educated workers to the biotechnology industry.  At each academic level (AA, BS/BA, MS/MA, Ph.D.) curricula are in place, but most of the curricula are only marginally related to biotechnology workforce preparation in the applied sector.  Applied education in the form of internships or instruction in practical science skills that would smooth the transition from academic institutions to the commercial biotechnology environment is even less prevalent than the biotechnology curricula offered at many schools, and is only now just emerging.

(8) Many of California’s firms have found that many students graduate from four-year university programs with adequate conceptual understanding of biotechnology, but with relatively little practical laboratory experience, especially in the skills and protocols that are specific to commercial ventures as opposed to academic research.

(9) In 2001, the Legislature created the Pasadena Bioscience Center to address biotechnology workforce needs in the Los Angeles region.  The Pasadena Bioscience Center provides applied workforce training and includes components for research and innovation, new business incubation, and bioinformatics.  In cooperation with California State University, the City of Pasadena, Pasadena City College, the California Institute of Technology, Huntington Medical Research Institutes, and local biotechnology companies and organizations, the Pasadena Bioscience Center serves as a successful model of focused education and training, tailored to specific industry needs, and that may be utilized in other areas of the state.

(b) The Legislature further finds and declares that to address workforce needs in biotechnology, a multiuse biotechnology training center is being created in San Diego to serve as an anchor and catalyst for the growth of biotechnology enterprises in San Diego.  The center will operate as a nonprofit organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and will serve as a catalyst for accelerating the growth and formation of new bioscience enterprises that will create value-added jobs and high economic multipliers in the San Diego region.  For this purpose:

(1) The center will provide state-of-the-art, industry-oriented bioscience training and act as a strong contributor to the growth and retention of bioscience companies in the region.  As such, the center, as proposed, will help encourage biotechnology companies to remain in the region, thereby offsetting the pull of other, less expensive business environments that have been recruiting both startup and existing local area bioscience companies.

(2) The center will utilize the organization, programs, and work of the Pasadena Bioscience Center as successful models in the development of the San Diego Multiuse Biotechnology Training Center and its programs.

(3) The new center will serve as a world class biotechnology workforce training facility offering practical, hands-on learning experiences, including short-term workshops and courses, and more extended training that will involve putting together multidisciplinary, multilevel teams of researchers, technicians, production specialists, apprentices, and students to work in a businesslike environment.

(4) The center will coordinate an extensive applied biotechnology internship program that will place students in local biotechnology companies for practical training and experience.

(5) The center will have the most relevant and advanced training possible, including an emphasis in bioinformatics, that will ensure that the center attains a position at the forefront of this rapidly expanding, cross-application specialization within biotechnology.

(6) The center will have facilities and a collection of instruments not generally available to the region’s secondary schools, colleges, or universities.

(7) The center can serve as a capstone training site for regional institutions.

(8) The center will address the needs of existing as well as future industry employees.

(9) The center may appoint directors to a board of directors, and existing participants in the center may serve as the original board of directors.  The center may appoint new directors, as necessary, in its discretion.

(10) The center will work with private universities, companies, associations, and various public agencies through memoranda of understanding under Section 9702, for the purpose of coordinating services and receiving assistance and support.



######### 9702.  
The San Diego Community College District, California State University, University of California, Employment Development Department, Employment Training Panel, California Health and Human Services Agency, Labor and Workforce Development Agency, California Workforce Investment Board, and the San Diego Workforce Partnership may enter into memoranda of understanding with the center to utilize existing staff and resources to provide any of the following:

(a) Funding, if moneys are appropriated.

(b) Staff.

(c) Program development.

(d) Outreach.

##### CHAPTER 3.5. Employment Training Panel [10200 - 10217]  

######### 10200.  
The Legislature finds and declares the following:

(a) California’s economy is being challenged by competition from other states and overseas. In order to meet this challenge, California’s employers, workers, labor organizations, and government need to invest in a skilled and productive workforce, and in developing the skills of frontline workers. For purposes of this section, “frontline worker” means a worker who directly produces or delivers goods or services.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish a strategically designed employment training program to promote a healthy labor market in a growing, competitive economy that shall fund only projects that meet the following criteria:

(1) Foster creation of high-wage, high-skilled jobs, or foster retention of high-wage, high-skilled jobs in manufacturing and other industries that are threatened by out-of-state and global competition, including, but not limited to, those industries in which targeted training resources for California’s small and medium-sized business suppliers will increase the state’s competitiveness to secure federal, private sector, and other nonstate funds. In addition, provide for retraining contracts in companies that make a monetary or in-kind contribution to the funded training enhancements.

(2) Encourage industry-based investment in human resources development that promotes the competitiveness of California industry through productivity and product quality enhancements.

(3) Result in secure jobs for those who successfully complete training. All training shall be customized to the specific requirements of one or more employers or a discrete industry and shall include general skills, including soft skills, that trainees can use in the future.

(4) Supplement, rather than displace, funds available through existing programs conducted by employers and government-funded training programs, such as the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2801 et seq.), the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act (Public Law 98-524), CalWORKs (Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 11200) of Part 3 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code), the Enterprise Zone Act (Chapter 12.8 (commencing with Section 7070) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code), and the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 11301 et seq.), the California Community Colleges Economic Development Program, or apportionment funds allocated to the community colleges, regional occupational centers and programs, or other local educational agencies. In addition, it is further the intention of the Legislature that programs developed pursuant to this chapter shall not replace, parallel, supplant, compete with, or duplicate in any way already existing approved apprenticeship programs.

(b) The Employment Training Panel, in funding projects that meet the requirements of subdivision (a), shall give funding priority to those projects that best meet the following goals:

(1) Result in the growth of the California economy by stimulating exports from the state and the production of goods and services that would otherwise be imported from outside the state.

(2) Train new employees of firms locating or expanding in the state that provide high-skilled, high-wage jobs and are committed to an ongoing investment in the training of frontline workers.

(3) Develop workers with skills that prepare them for the challenges of a high-performance workplace of the future.

(4) Train workers who have been displaced, have received notification of impending layoff, or are subject to displacement, because of a plant closure, workforce reduction, changes in technology, or significantly increasing levels of international and out-of-state competition.

(5) Are jointly developed by business management and worker representatives.

(6) Develop career ladders for workers.

(7) Promote the retention and expansion of the state’s manufacturing workforce.

(c) The program established through this chapter is to be coordinated with all existing employment training programs and economic development programs, including, but not limited to, programs such as the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2801 et seq.), the California Community Colleges, the regional occupational programs, vocational education programs, joint labor-management training programs, and related programs under the Employment Development Department and the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, and the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency.

##### CHAPTER 5. Employment Services for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired [11000 - 11006]  

######### 11000.  
The Legislature finds that over 1.5 million persons in California are deaf or significantly hard of hearing. Private and public employment agencies are not routinely adapted to meet the communication needs of persons who are deaf and hard of hearing and, therefore, the services they receive may be less than those provided to other persons. The Legislature also finds that employment opportunities for persons who are deaf and hard of hearing are increased when specialized counseling, interpretive, job placement, and followup services supplement conventional employment services. In addition, the limited programs that provide these specialized employment services to persons who are deaf and hard of hearing have recently been subject to significant local funding reductions. Therefore, the Legislature finds that a more stable funding source, as provided by this chapter, is necessary to ensure the continuance of these programs.

(c) If a contractor is a private nonprofit corporation, it shall submit a complete financial statement audited by a certified public accountant prior to a renewal of the contract.



######### 11002.  
Employment services for persons who are deaf and hard of hearing shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

(a) Complete communication services for all preparatory, job placement, and followup activities. The communication services shall include interpreter services by a professional interpreter for persons who are deaf and hard of hearing possessing the comprehensive skills certification of the National Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf or the equivalent, telecommunications, and, when necessary, training in communication skills.

(b) Advocacy to assure that persons who are deaf and hard of hearing receive equal access to public and private employment services.

(c) Job development and job placement.

(d) Employment counseling, including peer counseling by persons who are deaf and hard of hearing.

(1) Participation of persons who are deaf and hard of hearing on the potential contractor’s employment services staff, and in the case of a private nonprofit corporation, on the board of directors.

(2) A commitment to the development and maintenance of self-determination for persons who are deaf and hard of hearing.



######### 11004.  
The department shall do all of the following:

(a) Determine the number and location of its offices within the state providing employment services to individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing and decide which offices shall be served by contractors given the resources available under this chapter. The department shall give priority to offices where contracts are necessary in order to prevent or minimize the disruption or the discontinuance of employment services to individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing which have been provided in conjunction with the department before July 1, 1984.

(b) Coordinate the provision of employment services for individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing with the State Department of Social Services and the Department of Rehabilitation so that employment services provided by this chapter supplement or provide alternatives to services provided or funded by the departments.

(c) Establish uniform accounting procedures and contracts for use with regard to this chapter.

(d) Promulgate requests for proposals and conduct bidders’ conferences, and evaluate proposals according to the criteria established pursuant to Section 11003.

The department may grant a waiver only if it determines that the particular amount paid in excess of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), as stated in paragraph (1) was the result of an unprecedented occurrence for that employer, and was not representative of the employer’s cumulative average payment in prior years.

The department may grant a waiver if it determines that there will not be a negative impact on the interest earnings of the General Fund.

(f) Notwithstanding Section 1112, interest and penalties shall not be assessed against an employer that remits at least 95 percent of the amount required by subdivision (c) or (d) if the failure to remit the full amount is not willful and any remaining amount due is paid with the next payment. The director may allow any employer to submit the amounts due from multiple locations upon a showing that those submissions are necessary to comply with subdivision (c) or (d).

(g) The department may, if it believes that action is necessary, require any employer to make the report or return required by this section and pay to it the tax deducted and withheld at any time, or from time to time but no less frequently than provided for in subdivision (a).

(h) An employer required to withhold any tax and that is not required to make payment under subdivision (c) shall remit the total amount of income tax withheld during each month of each calendar quarter, on or before the 15th day of the subsequent month if the income tax withheld for any of the three months or, cumulatively for two or more months, is three hundred fifty dollars ($350) or more.

(i) For purposes of subdivisions (a), (c), and (h), payment that is not required to be made by electronic funds transfer is deemed complete when it is placed in a properly addressed envelope, bearing the correct postage, and it is deposited in the United States mail.

######### 13026.  
An employer shall not be required to deduct and withhold any tax under this division upon a payment of wages (except wages exempt from federal income tax but not exempt under this division) to an employee if there is in effect with respect to such payment a withholding exemption certificate, in such form and containing such other information as the department may prescribe, furnished to the employer by the employee certifying that the employee—

(a) Incurred no liability for federal income tax imposed under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for his or her preceding taxable year, and

An employer who is furnished by an employee a written statement of tips (received in a calendar month) pursuant to Section 13055 to which paragraph (2) of subdivision (n) of Section 13009 is applicable may deduct and withhold the tax with respect to such tips from any wages of the employee (excluding tips) under his or her control, even though at the time such statement is furnished the total amount of the tips included in statements furnished to the employer as having been received by the employee in such calendar month in the course of his or her employment by the employer is less than twenty dollars ($20). Such tax shall not at any time be deducted and withheld in any amount which exceeds the aggregate of such wages and funds.



######### 13028.  
(a) For purposes of this division (and so much of Part 10 (commencing with Section 17001) and Part 10.2 (commencing with Section 18401) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code as relates to this division) pensions, annuities, and other deferred income, as described in Section 3405 of the Internal Revenue Code, are wages and subject to withholding under this division. Amounts withheld shall be treated as if the amounts are withheld by an employer for a payroll period and only amounts withheld shall be reported to the department pursuant to Section 1088 and Section 13021.

(b) If an individual makes an election under Section 3405(a)(2) or Section 3405(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code not to have tax withheld, that election shall apply to withholding under this division, unless the individual elects, with the consent of the payer, to have those payments subject to withholding under this division. If an individual has not made an election under Section 3405(a)(2) or Section 3405(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, that individual may elect to exclude those payments from withholding under this division. Elections provided in this subdivision shall be made pursuant to regulations of the director.

(e) This section shall not apply to pensions, annuities, and other deferred income of payees with addresses outside this state, as shown on the most current records of the payer.

(f) The department shall, in consultation with the affected payers and payees, issue regulations to implement this section.

Those regulations shall provide for delay (but not beyond July 1, 1987) of the application of this section with respect to any payer or class of payers until that time as the payers are able to comply without undue hardship with the requirements of this section. In that case, no retroactive compliance shall be required.



######### 13028.1.  
If the director determines that nonpayment of tax by a nonresident under the income tax laws of this state may occur, the director shall notify the payer of payments described in subdivision (a) of Section 13028 that withholding shall be made from those payments. Upon notice from the director, the payer shall withhold from those payments as if they were subject to Section 13020. The director shall also notify the payee that withholding has been ordered pursuant to this section, and the reason for his or her determination that nonpayment of tax may occur.



######### 13028.5.  
(a) For purposes of this division (and so much of Part 10 (commencing with Section 17001) and Part 10.2 (commencing with Section 18401) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code as relates to this division) any supplemental unemployment compensation benefit paid to an individual shall be treated as if it were a payment of wages by an employer to an employee for a payroll period.

(b) For purposes of subdivision (a), “supplemental unemployment compensation benefits” means amounts which are paid to an employee, pursuant to a plan to which the employer is a party, because of an employee’s involuntary separation from employment (whether or not that separation is temporary), resulting directly from a reduction in force, the discontinuance of a plant or operation, or other similar conditions, but only to the extent those benefits are includable in the employee’s gross income.



######### 13028.6.  
(a) For purposes of this division (and so much of Part 10 (commencing with Section 17001) and Part 10.2 (commencing with Section 18401) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code as relates to this division), any payment to an individual of sick pay which does not constitute wages (determined without regard to this subdivision), if at the time the payment is made a request that such sick pay be subject to withholding under this division is in effect, shall be treated as if it were a payment of wages by an employer to an employee for a payroll period.

(b) For purposes of this subdivision, “sick pay” means any amount which satisfies both of the following:

(1) Is paid to an employee pursuant to a plan to which the employer is a party.

(2) Constitutes remuneration or a payment in lieu of remuneration for any period during which the employee is temporarily absent from work on account of sickness or personal injuries.

(c) If a payee makes a request that any sick pay be subject to withholding under this chapter, the amount to be deducted and withheld under this chapter from any payment to which that request applies shall be an amount (not less than a minimum amount determined by the Franchise Tax Board) specified by the payee in that request. The amount deducted and withheld with respect to a payment which is greater or less than a full payment shall bear the same relation to the specified amount as that payment bears to a full payment.

(1) A request that any sick pay be subject to withholding under this chapter shall satisfy all of the following:

(A) Shall be made by the payee in writing to the person making the payments and shall contain the social security number of the payee.

(B) Shall specify the amount to be deducted and withheld from each full payment.

(C) Shall take effect with respect to payments made more than seven days after the date on which that request is furnished to the payer, or as the department shall by regulations prescribe. That request may be changed or terminated by furnishing to the person making the payments a written statement of change or termination which shall take effect in the same manner as provided in the preceding sentence. At the election of the payer, any such request (or statement of change or revocation) may take effect earlier than as provided in this subparagraph.

(2) Any sick pay paid pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers which contains a provision specifying that this paragraph is to apply to sick pay paid pursuant to that agreement and contains a provision for determining the amount to be deducted and withheld from each payment of that sick pay as follows:

(A) The requirement of paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) that a request for withholding be in effect shall not apply.

(B) Except as provided in Section 13026, the amounts to be deducted and withheld under this chapter shall be determined in accordance with that agreement.

The preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to sick pay paid pursuant to any agreement to any individual, unless the social security number of that individual is furnished to the payer and the payer is furnished with that information as is necessary to determine whether the payment is pursuant to the agreement and to determine the amount to be deducted and withheld.



######### 13029.  
The department may by authorized regulations provide for withholding— 

   (a) From remuneration for services performed by an employee for his or her employer which (without regard to this section) does not constitute wages, and 

   (b) From any other type of payment with respect to which the department finds that withholding would be appropriate under the provisions of this division, 

if the employer and the employee, or in the case of any other type of payment the person making and the person receiving the payment, agree to the withholding. The agreement shall be made in the form and manner as the department may by authorized regulations provide. For purposes of this division (and so much of Part 10 (commencing with Section 17001) and Part 10.2 (commencing with Section 18401) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code as relates to this division) remuneration or other payments with respect to which the agreement is made shall be treated as if they were wages paid by an employer to an employee to the extent that the remuneration is paid or other payments are made during the period for which the agreement is in effect.



######### 13030.  
If wages are paid with respect to a period which is not a payroll period, the amount to be deducted and withheld shall be that applicable in the case of a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days, including Sundays and holidays, equal to the number of days in the period with respect to which such wages are paid. In any case in which wages are paid by an employer without regard to any payroll period or other period, the amount to be deducted and withheld shall be that applicable in the case of a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days equal to the number of days, including Sundays and holidays, which have elapsed since the date of the last payment of such wages by such employer during the calendar year, or the date of commencement of employment with such employer during such year, or January 1st of such year, whichever is the later. In any case in which the period of time described, or the time prescribed in the preceding sentence in respect of any wages, is less than one week, the department may by authorized regulation permit an employer, in computing the tax required to be deducted and withheld, to use the excess of the aggregate of the wages paid to the employee during the calendar week over the withholding exemption allowed by Section 13020 for a weekly payroll period.



######### 13031.  
If the remuneration paid by an employer to an employee for services performed during one-half or more of any payroll period of not more than 31 consecutive days constitutes wages, all the remuneration paid by such employer to such employee for such period shall be deemed to be wages, but if the remuneration paid by an employer to an employee for services performed during more than one-half of any such payroll period does not constitute wages, then none of the remuneration paid by such employer to such employee for such period shall be deemed to be wages.







##### CHAPTER 3. Withholding Exemptions [13040 - 13043]  

######### 13040.  
(a) An employer shall use the exemption certificate filed by the employee with the employer in such form and containing such information as the department may prescribe, for determining the number of withholding exemptions to be allowed in computing the tax required to be deducted and withheld under Section 13020.  However, if the employer cannot determine the employee’s marital status from the exemption certificate the employee shall be considered unmarried.

(b) No withholding exemptions shall be allowed until the employee files a new withholding exemption certificate if the department finds that the withholding exemption certificate filed under this division does not properly reflect the number of exemptions allowable and so advises the employer in writing.



######### 13041.  
The number and amount of withholding exemptions allowed shall be based upon the persons claimed in a withholding exemption certificate in effect under Section 13040, except that if no such certificate is in effect, the number of withholding exemptions claimed shall be considered to be zero.



######### 13042.  
A new withholding exemption certificate filed under this division in cases in which a previous certificate was in effect shall take effect with respect to the first payment of wages made on or after the first status determination date which occurs at least 30 days from the date on which such certificate is so furnished, except that at the election of the employer such certificate may be made effective with respect to any payment of wages made on or after the date on which such certificate is so furnished.

For purposes of this section, “status determination date,” means January 1,  May 1, July 1, and October 1, of each year.



######### 13043.  
(a) The amount to be deducted and withheld under this division shall be prescribed pursuant to Section 18663 of the Revenue and Taxation Code when a payment of wages is made to an employee by an employer in any of the following cases:

(1) With respect to a payroll period or other period, any part of which is included in a payroll period or other period with respect to which wages are also paid to the employee by the employer.

(2) Without regard to any payroll period or other period, but on or prior to the expiration of a payroll period or other period with respect to which wages are also paid to the employee by the employer.

(3) With respect to a period beginning in one and ending in another calendar year.

(4) Through an agent, fiduciary, or other person who also has the control, receipt, custody, or disposal of, or pays, the wages payable by another employer to the employee.

(b) For purposes of this section, an employee’s remuneration may consist of wages paid for a payroll period and supplemental wages.

Supplemental wages include, but are not limited to, bonus payments, overtime payments, commissions, sales awards, back pay including retroactive wage increases, and reimbursements for nondeductible moving expenses that are paid for the same or different period, or without regard to a particular period.

(c) When any supplemental wages are paid subsequent to the payment of regular wages, the employer may determine the personal income tax to be withheld from supplemental wages paid by (1) using a flat percentage rate pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 18663 of the Revenue and Taxation Code without allowance for exemptions and credits and without reference to any regular payment of wages, or (2) adding the supplemental wages to the regular wages paid the employee and computing the personal income tax to be withheld on the whole amount (the computed tax minus the tax withheld from the regular wages shall be withheld from the supplemental wages).  Where supplemental wages are paid at the same time as regular wages, the personal income tax to be withheld shall be computed on the total of the supplemental and regular wages and shall be determined as if the total of the supplemental wages and the regular wages constituted a single wage payment for the regular payroll period.

(d) For stock options and bonus payments that constitute wages paid on or after January 1, 2002, the employer may determine the personal income tax to be withheld from the stock options and bonus payments paid by either (1) using a flat percentage rate pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 18663 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, without allowance for exemptions and credits and without reference to any regular payment of wages, or (2) adding the stock options and bonus payments to the regular wages paid the employee and computing the personal income tax to be withheld on the whole amount (the computed tax minus the tax withheld from the regular wages shall be withheld from the stock options and bonus payments).  Where the stock options and bonus payments are paid at the same time as regular wages, the personal income tax to be withheld shall be computed on the total of the stock options and bonus payments and regular wages, and shall be determined as if the total of the stock options and bonus payments and the regular wages constituted a single wage payment for the regular payroll period.

(a) Numerous studies have indicated the significant economic contributions of immigrants to this state and the nation as a whole. Businesses launched by immigrant entrepreneurs create millions of jobs, generate billions of dollars in revenue, and help revitalize communities.

(b) California has the highest concentration of immigrant business owners in the nation. From 2007 to 2011, immigrants founded 44 percent of new businesses in the state. In 2016, undocumented immigrant entrepreneurs generated over $3 billion in business income in California.

(c) In 2017, individuals eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) earned over $23 billion in income and paid almost $1.8 billion in state and local taxes; more than 43,000 were entrepreneurs, providing jobs and supporting local economies. Individuals granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) earned over $7 billion in 2017, and paid more than $890 million in federal taxes and over $650 million in state and local taxes.

(d) Individuals who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents, or who are limited English proficient, face multiple impediments that may prevent them from securing and maintaining gainful employment. For example, due to actions at the federal level, DACA and TPS recipients, who are vital members of our communities and spark economic development, have been deprived of or are at risk of being denied certain federal protections, which will result in economic hardship for them and their families.

(e) It is in the best interest of the State of California to enable these individuals to continue contributing to the economic vibrancy of this state, by supporting entrepreneurial opportunities to start and grow small businesses that will open up paths to economic self-sufficiency.

While this includes individuals who have been granted DACA or TPS, the SEED Initiative is open to all individuals in the target populations, including but not limited to other immigrants, refugees and asylees, and United States citizens.

(c) The purpose of the SEED Initiative is to support burgeoning entrepreneurship of individuals in SEED target populations, which will also increase the economic diversity of the state and help spur business innovation.

(a) Workplace shootings, especially in high-stress industries such as transit agencies, have resulted in numerous deaths across California.

(b) On May 26, 2021, a Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) employee entered the Guadalupe rail yard and began a shooting rampage that killed nine of his coworkers before taking his own life. This shooting is the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the San Francisco Bay area.

(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(1) The State of California has long been a national and international leader on environmental, natural resource, pollution prevention, and energy issues, as well as recent landmark laws in the areas of climate change, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and alternative transportation fuels.

(2) The passage of these laws has resulted in billions of dollars of investment capital flowing into the State of California for research, development, and commercialization of new green and clean technologies. This investment of capital is indicative of the rapidly growing clean and green technology sector of the California economy.

(3) California’s green economy is about the potential of new technologies combined with innovative public policy and strategic investments to stimulate the growth of new markets for green products and services.

(4) As the green economy grows, it will be accompanied by an increased demand for a highly skilled and well-trained “green collar” workforce.

(5) California state government must act promptly to build the partnerships, expand the programs, and secure the resources necessary to meet our green workforce needs. This effort must involve both our K–12 and higher education systems, labor unions, the environmental community, workforce development programs, nongovernmental organizations, philanthropy, and private sector industries.

(6) In acknowledgment of the tremendous size of California’s economy and related infrastructure, the application of sector strategies in a wide variety of industry sectors is essential to providing labor for industry and career paths for current and potential employees. The California Workforce Investment Board shall adopt a sector strategy approach in responding to industry sector workforce and economic development needs. This strategy will ensure industry has a qualified workforce and can offer opportunities for employment, training, and career advancement for all Californians. The initial drive of this sector strategy approach will be the California Green Collar Jobs Act of 2008.

The GCJC may consult with other state agencies, other higher education representatives, local workforce investment boards, and industry representatives as well as philanthropic, nongovernmental, and environmental groups, as appropriate, in the development of a strategic initiative. To the extent private funds are available, is the intent of the Legislature that the GCJC will develop an annual award for outstanding achievement for workforce training programs operated by local or state agencies, businesses, or nongovernment organizations to be named after Parrish R. Collins.

(b) As part of the strategic initiative, the GCJC shall focus on developing the framework, funding, strategies, programs, policies, partnerships, and opportunities necessary to address the growing need for a highly skilled and well-trained workforce to meet the needs of California’s emerging green economy. The GCJC shall do all of the following:

(1) Assist in identifying and linking green collar job opportunities with workforce development training opportunities in local workforce investment areas (LWIAs), encouraging regional collaboration among LWIAs to meet regional economic demands.

(2) Align workforce development activities with regional economic recovery and growth strategies.

(3) Develop public, private, philanthropic, and nongovernmental partnerships to build and expand the state’s workforce development programs, network, and infrastructure.

(4) Provide policy guidance for job training programs for the clean and green technology sectors to help them prepare specific populations, such as at-risk youth, displaced workers, veterans, formerly incarcerated individuals, and others facing barriers to employment.

(5) Develop, collect, analyze, and distribute statewide and regional labor market data on California’s new and emerging green industries workforce needs, trends, and job growth.

(6) Collaborate with community colleges and other educational institutions, registered apprenticeship programs, business and labor organizations, and community-based and philanthropic organizations to align workforce development services with strategies for regional economic growth.

(7) Identify funding resources and make recommendations on how to expand and leverage these funds.

(8) Foster regional collaboratives in the green economic sector.

(c) The CWIB may accept any revenues, moneys, grants, goods, or services from federal and state entities, philanthropic organizations, and other sources, to be used for purposes relating to the administration and implementation of the strategic initiative, as described in subdivision (b). The CWIB shall also ensure the highest level of transparency and accountability and make information available on the CWIB Internet Web site.

(d) Upon appropriation by the Legislature, the department may expend the moneys and revenues received pursuant to subdivision (c) for purposes related to the administration and implementation of the strategic initiative, and for the award of workforce training grants implementing the strategic initiative.



######### 15003.  
(a) On or before April 1, 2011, and annually each April 1 thereafter, the CWIB shall report to the Legislature on the status of GCJC activities, grants awarded, and its development and implementation of a green workforce strategic initiative.

(b) The GCJC shall also consult with the appropriate state and local agencies to identify opportunities to coordinate the award of grant and green workforce training funds received by the state under the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) or any other funding sources. 






##### DIVISION 9. CALWORKS PROGRAM:  JOB CREATION [17000 - 17002]  

######### 17000.  
As used in this division “department” means the Employment Development Department.

######### 17002.  
In carrying out the provisions of this division, the department shall conduct activities including, but not limited to, the following:
