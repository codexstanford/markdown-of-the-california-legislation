##### DIVISION 1. PURPOSE AND PRELIMINARY MATTERS [100 - 102]  

######### 100.  
The Legislature finds and declares that placing all public contract law in one code will make that law clearer and easier to find. Further, it is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this code to achieve the following objectives:

(a) To clarify the law with respect to competitive bidding requirements.

(c) To provide all qualified bidders with a fair opportunity to enter the bidding process, thereby stimulating competition in a manner conducive to sound fiscal practices.

(d) To eliminate favoritism, fraud, and corruption in the awarding of public contracts.



######### 101.  
California public contract law should be efficient and the product of the best of modern practice and research.



######### 102.  
To encourage competition for public contracts and to aid public officials in the efficient administration of public contracting, to the maximum extent possible, for similar work performed for similar agencies, California’s public contract law should be uniform.

##### CHAPTER 2.7. Iran Contracting Act of 2010 [2200 - 2208]  

######### 2200.  
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Iran Contracting Act of 2010.



######### 2201.  
The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:

(a) In imposing United States sanctions on Iran, Congress and the President have determined that the illicit nuclear activities of the Government of Iran, combined with its development of unconventional weapons and ballistic missiles, and its support of international terrorism, represent a serious threat to the security of the United States, Israel, and other United States allies in Europe, the Middle East, and around the world. 

(b) On September 9, 2009, it was reported that American intelligence agencies have concluded that Iran has already created enough nuclear fuel to develop a nuclear weapon, and United States Ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency Glyn Davies declared that Iran had achieved “possible breakout capacity.” 

(c) On September 21, 2009, Iran sent a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency acknowledging that it is considering a previously undeclared “new pilot fuel enrichment plan.” 

(d) On Sept. 25, 2009, President Barack H. Obama, joined by Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, stated that the secret plant “represents a direct challenge to the basic foundation of the nonproliferation regime” and “deepens a growing concern that Iran is refusing to live up to those international responsibilities, including specifically revealing all nuclear-related activities. As the international community knows, this is not the first time that Iran has concealed information about its nuclear program.” 

(e) The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly called attention to Iran’s unlawful nuclear activities, and, as a result, the United Nations Security Council has adopted a range of sanctions designed to encourage the Government of Iran to cease those activities and comply with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (commonly known as the “Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty”). 

(f) On July 1, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 2194, the “Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010” (Public Law 111-195), which expressly authorizes states and local governments to prevent investment in, including prohibiting entry into or renewing contracts with, companies operating in Iran’s energy sector with investments that have the result of directly or indirectly supporting the efforts of the Government of Iran to achieve nuclear weapons capability.

(g) On October 7, 2008, then-Senator Obama stated, “Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it’s an oil producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down. If we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze on them.” 

(h) The serious and urgent nature of the threat from Iran demands that states, local governments, educational institutions, and private institutions work together with the federal government and American allies to do everything possible diplomatically, politically, and economically to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability. 

(i) There are moral and reputational reasons for this state and local governments to not engage in business with foreign companies that have business activities benefiting foreign states, such as Iran, that commit egregious violations of human rights, proliferate nuclear weapons capabilities, and support terrorism.

(j) It is the responsibility of the state to decide how, where, and by whom its financial resources should be invested. It also is the prerogative of the state to not invest in, or do business with, companies whose investments with Iran place those companies at risk from the impact of economic sanctions imposed upon the Government of Iran for sponsoring terrorism, committing egregious violations of human rights, and engaging in illicit nuclear weapons development. 

(k) The human rights situation in Iran has steadily deteriorated in 2009, as punctuated by transparently fraudulent elections and the brutal repression and murder, arbitrary arrests, and show trials of peaceful dissidents. 

(l) During the postelection protests in June 2009, the Iranian government imposed widespread and unjustifiable restrictions on telecommunications services, denying the citizens of Iran their rights and liberties to free speech. 

(m) On October 14, 2007, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger stated his intention to support “efforts to further prevent terrorism” when signing Assembly Bill 221, which prohibits the state’s pension funds from investing in companies with active business in Iran. 

(n) This state currently honors contracts with foreign companies that may be at financial risk due to business ties with foreign states, such as Iran, that are involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, commit human rights violations, and support terrorism. 

(o) The concerns of the State of California regarding Iran are strictly the result of the actions of the Government of Iran.

(p) The people of the State of California declare all of the following:

(1) We have feelings of friendship for the people of Iran.

(2) We regret that developments in recent decades have created impediments to that friendship.

(3) We hold the people of Iran, their culture, and their ancient and rich history in the highest esteem. 

(q) In order to effectively address the need for the governments of this state to respond to the policies of Iran in a uniform fashion, prohibiting contracts with persons engaged in investment activities in the energy sector of Iran must be accomplished on a statewide basis, and, therefore, the subject is a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair. 

(r) It is the intent of the Legislature to implement the authority granted under Section 202 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-195).



######### 2202.

The notice shall inform the person that inclusion on the list would make the person ineligible to bid on, submit a proposal for, or enter into or renew, a contract for goods or services of one million dollars ($1,000,000) or more with a public entity. The notice shall specify that the person, if it ceases its engagement in investment activities in Iran as described in subdivision (a) of Section 2202.5, may become eligible for a future contract, or contract renewal, for goods or services of one million dollars ($1,000,000) or more with a public entity upon removal from the list.

(e) The determination of the Labor Commissioner as to the amount of the penalty imposed under subdivision (a) shall be reviewable by the Director of Industrial Relations only for an abuse of discretion.

(f) If a subcontractor is found to have violated this chapter, the prime contractor of the project is not liable for any penalties under subdivision (a) unless the prime contractor had knowledge of the subcontractor’s failure to comply with this chapter or unless the prime contractor fails to comply with any of the following requirements:

(1) For contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2019, the contract executed between the contractor and the subcontractor for the performance of work on the project shall include a copy of this chapter.

(a) (1) The name, the location of the place of business, the California contractor license number, and public works contractor registration number issued pursuant to Section 1725.5 of the Labor Code of each subcontractor who will perform work or labor or render service to the prime contractor in or about the construction of the work or improvement, or a subcontractor licensed by the State of California who, under subcontract to the prime contractor, specially fabricates and installs a portion of the work or improvement according to detailed drawings contained in the plans and specifications, in an amount in excess of one-half of 1 percent of the prime contractor’s total bid or, in the case of bids or offers for the construction of streets or highways, including bridges, in excess of one-half of 1 percent of the prime contractor’s total bid or ten thousand dollars ($10,000), whichever is greater.

(2) An inadvertent error in listing the California contractor license number or public works contractor registration number provided pursuant to paragraph (1) shall not be grounds for filing a bid protest or grounds for considering the bid nonresponsive if the corrected contractor’s license number is submitted to the public entity by the prime contractor within 24 hours after the bid opening and provided the corrected contractor’s license number corresponds to the submitted name and location for that subcontractor.

(3) (A) Subject to subparagraph (B), any information requested by the officer, department, board, or commission concerning any subcontractor who the prime contractor is required to list under this subdivision, other than the subcontractor’s name, location of business, the California contractor license number, and the public works contractor registration number, may be submitted by the prime contractor up to 24 hours after the deadline established by the officer, department, board, or commission for receipt of bids by prime contractors.

(B) A state or local agency may implement subparagraph (A) at its option.

(b) The portion of the work that will be done by each subcontractor under this act. The prime contractor shall list only one subcontractor for each portion as is defined by the prime contractor in his or her bid.



######### 4104.5.  
(a) The officer, department, board, or commission taking bids for construction of any public work or improvement shall specify in the bid invitation and public notice the place the bids of the prime contractors are to be received and the time by which they shall be received. The date and time shall be extended by no less than 72 hours if the officer, department, board, or commission issues any material changes, additions, or deletions to the invitation later than 72 hours prior to the bid closing. Any bids received after the time specified in the notice or any extension due to material changes shall be returned unopened.

(b) As used in this section, the term “material change” means a change with a substantial cost impact on the total bid as determined by the awarding agency.

(c) As used in this section, the term “bid invitation” shall include any documents issued to prime contractors that contain descriptions of the work to be bid or the content, form, or manner of submission of bids by bidders.



######### 4105.  
Circumvention by a general contractor who bids as a prime contractor of the requirement under Section 4104 for him or her to list his or her subcontractors, by the device of listing another contractor who will in turn sublet portions constituting the majority of the work covered by the prime contract, shall be considered a violation of this chapter and shall subject that prime contractor to the penalties set forth in Sections 4110 and 4111.



######### 4106.  
If a prime contractor fails to specify a subcontractor or if a prime contractor specifies more than one subcontractor for the same portion of work to be performed under the contract in excess of one-half of 1 percent of the prime contractor’s total bid, the prime contractor agrees that he or she is fully qualified to perform that portion himself or herself, and that the prime contractor shall perform that portion himself or herself.

If after award of contract, the prime contractor subcontracts, except as provided for in Sections 4107 or 4109, any such portion of the work, the prime contractor shall be subject to the penalties named in Section 4111.



######### 4107.  
A prime contractor whose bid is accepted may not:

(a) Substitute a person as subcontractor in place of the subcontractor listed in the original bid, except that the awarding authority, or its duly authorized officer, may, except as otherwise provided in Section 4107.5, consent to the substitution of another person as a subcontractor in any of the following situations:

(1) When the subcontractor listed in the bid, after having had a reasonable opportunity to do so, fails or refuses to execute a written contract for the scope of work specified in the subcontractor’s bid and at the price specified in the subcontractor’s bid, when that written contract, based upon the general terms, conditions, plans, and specifications for the project involved or the terms of that subcontractor’s written bid, is presented to the subcontractor by the prime contractor.

(2) When the listed subcontractor becomes insolvent or the subject of an order for relief in bankruptcy.

(3) When the listed subcontractor fails or refuses to perform his or her subcontract.

(4) When the listed subcontractor fails or refuses to meet the bond requirements of the prime contractor as set forth in Section 4108.

(5) When the prime contractor demonstrates to the awarding authority, or its duly authorized officer, subject to the further provisions set forth in Section 4107.5, that the name of the subcontractor was listed as the result of an inadvertent clerical error.

(6) When the listed subcontractor is not licensed pursuant to the Contractors License Law.

(7) When the awarding authority, or its duly authorized officer, determines that the work performed by the listed subcontractor is substantially unsatisfactory and not in substantial accordance with the plans and specifications, or that the subcontractor is substantially delaying or disrupting the progress of the work.

(8) When the listed subcontractor is ineligible to work on a public works project pursuant to Section 1777.1 or 1777.7 of the Labor Code.

(9) When the awarding authority determines that a listed subcontractor is not a responsible contractor.

Prior to approval of the prime contractor’s request for the substitution, the awarding authority, or its duly authorized officer, shall give notice in writing to the listed subcontractor of the prime contractor’s request to substitute and of the reasons for the request. The notice shall be served by certified or registered mail to the last known address of the subcontractor. The listed subcontractor who has been so notified has five working days within which to submit written objections to the substitution to the awarding authority. Failure to file these written objections constitutes the listed subcontractor’s consent to the substitution.

If written objections are filed, the awarding authority shall give notice in writing of at least five working days to the listed subcontractor of a hearing by the awarding authority on the prime contractor’s request for substitution.

(b) Permit a subcontract to be voluntarily assigned or transferred or allow it to be performed by anyone other than the original subcontractor listed in the original bid, without the consent of the awarding authority, or its duly authorized officer.

(c) Other than in the performance of “change orders” causing changes or deviations from the original contract, sublet or subcontract any portion of the work in excess of one-half of 1 percent of the prime contractor’s total bid as to which his or her original bid did not designate a subcontractor.



######### 4107.2.  
No subcontractor listed by a prime contractor under Section 4104 as furnishing and installing carpeting, shall voluntarily sublet his or her subcontract with respect to any portion of the labor to be performed unless he or she specified the subcontractor in his or her bid for that subcontract to the prime contractor.



######### 4107.5.  
The prime contractor as a condition to assert a claim of inadvertent clerical error in the listing of a subcontractor shall within two working days after the time of the prime bid opening by the awarding authority give written notice to the awarding authority and copies of that notice to both the subcontractor he or she claims to have listed in error and the intended subcontractor who had bid to the prime contractor prior to bid opening.

Any listed subcontractor who has been notified by the prime contractor in accordance with this section as to an inadvertent clerical error shall be allowed six working days from the time of the prime bid opening within which to submit to the awarding authority and to the prime contractor written objection to the prime contractor’s claim of inadvertent clerical error. Failure of the listed subcontractor to file the written notice within the six working days shall be primary evidence of his or her agreement that an inadvertent clerical error was made.

The awarding authority shall, after a public hearing as provided in Section 4107 and in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary, consent to the substitution of the intended subcontractor:

(a) If (1) the prime contractor, (2) the subcontractor listed in error, and (3) the intended subcontractor each submit an affidavit to the awarding authority along with such additional evidence as the parties may wish to submit that an inadvertent clerical error was in fact made, provided that the affidavits from each of the three parties are filed within eight working days from the time of the prime bid opening, or

(b) If the affidavits are filed by both the prime contractor and the intended subcontractor within the specified time but the subcontractor whom the prime contractor claims to have listed in error does not submit within six working days, to the awarding authority and to the prime contractor, written objection to the prime contractor’s claim of inadvertent clerical error as provided in this section.

If the affidavits are filed by both the prime contractor and the intended subcontractor but the listed subcontractor has, within six working days from the time of the prime bid opening, submitted to the awarding authority and to the prime contractor written objection to the prime contractor’s claim of inadvertent clerical error, the awarding authority shall investigate the claims of the parties and shall hold a public hearing as provided in Section 4107 to determine the validity of those claims. Any determination made shall be based on the facts contained in the declarations submitted under penalty of perjury by all three parties and supported by testimony under oath and subject to cross-examination. The awarding authority may, on its own motion or that of any other party, admit testimony of other contractors, any bid registries or depositories, or any other party in possession of facts which may have a bearing on the decision of the awarding authority.



######### 4107.7.  
If a contractor who enters into a contract with a public entity for investigation, removal or remedial action, or disposal relative to the release or presence of a hazardous material or hazardous waste fails to pay a subcontractor registered as a hazardous waste hauler pursuant to Section 25163 of the Health and Safety Code within 10 days after the investigation, removal or remedial action, or disposal is completed, the subcontractor may serve a stop notice upon the public entity in accordance with Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 9350) of Title 3 of Part 6 of Division 4 of the Civil Code.



######### 4108.  
(a)  It shall be the responsibility of each subcontractor submitting bids to a prime contractor to be prepared to submit a faithful performance and payment bond or bonds if so requested by the prime contractor. 

(b) In the event any subcontractor submitting a bid to a prime contractor does not, upon the request of the prime contractor and at the expense of the prime contractor at the established charge or premium therefor, furnish to the prime contractor a bond or bonds issued by an admitted surety wherein the prime contractor shall be named the obligee, guaranteeing prompt and faithful performance of the subcontract and the payment of all claims for labor and materials furnished or used in and about the work to be done and performed under the subcontract, the prime contractor may reject the bid and make a substitution of another subcontractor subject to Section 4107. 

(c) (1) The bond or bonds may be required under this section only if the prime contractor in his or her written or published request for subbids clearly specifies the amount and requirements of the bond or bonds.

(2) If the expense of the bond or bonds required under this section is to be borne by the subcontractor, that requirement shall also be specified in the prime contractor’s written or published request for subbids. 

(3) The prime contractor’s failure to specify bond requirements, in accordance with this subdivision, in the written or published request for subbids shall preclude the prime contractor from imposing bond requirements under this section.



######### 4109.  
Subletting or subcontracting of any portion of the work in excess of one-half of 1 percent of the prime contractor’s total bid as to which no subcontractor was designated in the original bid shall only be permitted in cases of public emergency or necessity, and then only after a finding reduced to writing as a public record of the awarding authority setting forth the facts constituting the emergency or necessity.



######### 4110.  
A prime contractor violating any of the provisions of this chapter violates his or her contract and the awarding authority may exercise the option, in its own discretion, of (1) canceling his or her contract or (2) assessing the prime contractor a penalty in an amount of not more than 10 percent of the amount of the subcontract involved, and this penalty shall be deposited in the fund out of which the prime contract is awarded. In any proceedings under this section the prime contractor shall be entitled to a public hearing and to five days’ notice of the time and place thereof.



######### 4111.  
Violation of this chapter by a licensee under Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code constitutes grounds for disciplinary action by the Contractors State License Board, in addition to the penalties prescribed in Section 4110.



######### 4112.  
The failure on the part of a contractor to comply with any provision of this chapter does not constitute a defense to the contractor in any action brought against the contractor by a subcontractor.



######### 4113.  
As used in this chapter, the word “subcontractor” shall mean a contractor, within the meaning of the provisions of Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code, who contracts directly with the prime contractor.

“Prime contractor” shall mean the contractor who contracts directly with the awarding authority.

The county board of supervisors, when it is the awarding authority, may delegate its functions under Sections 4107 and 4110 to any officer designated by the board.

The authorized officer shall make a written recommendation to the board of supervisors. The board of supervisors may adopt the recommendation without further notice or hearing, or may set the matter for a de novo hearing before the board.

If the plaintiff fails to recover judgment, the plaintiff shall pay all costs incurred by the public entity in the suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee to be fixed by the court.

(b) If an awarding authority for the state consents to relieve a bidder of a bid because of mistake, the authority shall prepare a report in writing to document the facts establishing the existence of each element required by Section 5103. The report shall be available for inspection as a public record. In the case of the University of California or a California State University, the report shall be filed with the regents and the trustees, respectively, and shall be available as a public record.

The bidder shall establish to the satisfaction of the court that:

(b) He or she gave the public entity written notice within five working days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and state holidays, after the opening of the bids of the mistake, specifying in the notice in detail how the mistake occurred.

(c) The mistake made the bid materially different than he or she intended it to be.

(d) The mistake was made in filling out the bid and not due to error in judgment or to carelessness in inspecting the site of the work, or in reading the plans or specifications.



######### 5104.  
Other than the notice to the public entity, no claim is required to be filed before bringing the action.



######### 5105.  
A bidder who claims a mistake or who forfeits his or her bid security shall be prohibited from participating in further bidding on the project on which the mistake was claimed or security forfeited.

If the second lowest bidder fails or refuses to execute the contract, the public entity may likewise award it to the third lowest bidder.

On the failure or refusal of the second or third lowest bidder to whom a contract is so awarded to execute it, his or her bidder’s security shall be likewise forfeited.



######### 5107.  
In all actions brought under the provisions of this chapter, all courts wherein such actions are or may hereafter be pending, shall give such actions preference over all other civil actions therein, in the matter of setting the same for hearing or trial, and in hearing the same, to the end that all such actions shall be quickly heard and determined.



######### 5110.

If the contract is later determined to be invalid due to a defect or defects in the competitive bidding process caused solely by the public entity, the contractor who entered into the contract with the public entity shall be entitled to be paid the reasonable cost, specifically excluding profit, of the labor, equipment, materials, and services furnished by the contractor prior to the date of the determination that the contract is invalid if all of the following conditions are met:

(1) The contractor proceeded with construction, alteration, repair, or improvement based upon a good faith belief that the contract was valid.

(2) The public entity has reasonably determined that the work performed is satisfactory.

(3) Contractor fraud did not occur in the obtaining or performance of the contract.

(4) The contract does not otherwise violate statutory or constitutional limitations.

(b) In no event shall payment to the contractor pursuant to this section exceed either of the following:

(1) The contractor’s costs as included in its bid plus the cost of any approved change orders.

(b) For purposes of this section, “immigrant” means a person who is not a citizen or national of the United States.



######### 6102.  
(a) A contract that was entered into because of an act that would constitute a violation of a state or federal crime relating to bribery of a public official, including, but not limited to, a violation of Section 68 or 86 of the Penal Code is voidable.

(b) This section applies to contracts executed on or after January 1, 2023, including contracts negotiated prior to January 1, 2023.



######### 6106.  
(a) Any state agency or department, which is subject to this code, shall follow this section in negotiating fees and executing a contract for professional consulting services of a private architectural, engineering, land surveying, environmental, or construction project management firm.

(b) After providing notification to the successful firm of its selection, the state shall provide written instructions for the negotiations which are to follow. These instructions shall provide the private consulting firm with necessary information which shall allow the negotiations to proceed in an orderly fashion. Negotiations shall begin within 14 days after the successful firm has been notified of its selection or upon receipt of the cost proposal. The contractor should be notified if additional time is necessary to begin negotiations.

(c) Upon the completion of negotiations, the state and the private firm shall proceed to execute a contract so that the contract may be completed by the state within 45 days.

The contractor may direct the investment of the payments into securities, pursuant to subdivision (d), and the contractor shall receive the interest earned on the investments. Upon satisfactory completion of the contract, the contractor shall receive from the escrow agent all securities, interest, and payments received by the escrow agent from the owner, pursuant to the terms of this section. State agencies, relative to contracts entered into prior to the enactment of this section, upon written request of the contractor, and subject to the approval of the state agency, may utilize the provisions of this section.

(d) Securities eligible for investment under this section shall include those listed in Section 16430 of the Government Code, interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, or any other investment mutually agreed to by the contractor and the state agency.

(e) (1) Any contractor who elects to receive interest on moneys withheld in retention by a state agency shall, at the request of any subcontractor, make that option available to the subcontractor regarding any moneys withheld in retention by the contractor from the subcontractor. If the contractor elects to receive interest on any moneys withheld in retention by a state agency, then the subcontractor shall receive the identical rate of interest received by the contractor on any retention moneys withheld from the subcontractor by the contractor, less any actual pro rata costs associated with administering and calculating that interest. In the event that the interest rate is a fluctuating rate, the rate for the subcontractor shall be determined by calculating the interest rate paid during the time that retentions were withheld from the subcontractor.

(2) This subdivision shall apply only to those subcontractors performing more than 5 percent of the contractor’s total fee.

(3) No contractor shall require any subcontractor to waive any provision of this section.

(f) An escrow agreement used pursuant to this section shall be null, void, and unenforceable unless it is substantially similar to the following form:

######### 6107.  
(a) As used in this section, “California company” means a sole proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or other business entity that was a licensed California contractor on the date when bids for the public contract were opened and meets one of the following:

(1) Has its principal place of business in California.

(2) Has its principal place of business in a state in which there is no local contractor preference on construction contracts.

(3) Has its principal place of business in a state in which there is a local contractor construction preference and the contractor has paid not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000) in sales or use taxes to California for construction related activity for each of the five years immediately preceding the submission of the bid.

(b) (1) When awarding contracts for construction, a state agency shall grant a California company a reciprocal preference as against a nonresident contractor from any state that gives or requires a preference to be given contractors from that state on its public entity construction contracts.

(2) The amount of the reciprocal preference shall be equal to the amount of the preference applied by the state of the nonresident contractor with the lowest responsive bid, except where the resident contractor is eligible for a California small business preference, in which case the preference applied shall be the greater of the two, but not both.

(3) If the contractor submitting the lowest responsive bid is not a California company and has its principal place of business in any state that gives or requires the giving of a preference on its public entity construction contracts to contractors from that state, and if a California company has also submitted a responsive bid, and, with the benefit of the reciprocal preference, the California company’s bid is equal to or less than the original lowest responsive bid, the public entity shall award the contract to the California company at its submitted bid price.

(c) (1) The bidder shall certify, under penalty of perjury, that the bidder qualifies as a California company.

(2) A nonresident contractor shall, at the time of bidding, disclose to the awarding agency any and all bid preferences provided to the nonresident contractor by the state or country in which the nonresident contractor has its principal place of business.

(d) The reciprocal preference is waived if the certification described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) does not appear on the bid.

(e) This section does not apply if application of this section might jeopardize the receipt of federal funds or the nonresident contractor certifies, under penalty of perjury, in its bid that its state of residency does not give a preference for contractors from that state on its public entity construction contracts.

(f) “Construction related activity” shall include, without limitation, any activity for which a California contractors’ license is required.



######### 6108.  
(a) (1) Every contract entered into by any state agency for the procurement or laundering of apparel, garments, or corresponding accessories, or the procurement of equipment, materials, or supplies, other than procurement related to a public works contract, shall require that a contractor certify that no apparel, garments, corresponding accessories, equipment, materials, or supplies furnished to the state pursuant to the contract have been laundered or produced in whole or in part by sweatshop labor, forced labor, convict labor, indentured labor under penal sanction, abusive forms of child labor, or exploitation of children in sweatshop labor, or with the benefit of sweatshop labor, forced labor, convict labor, indentured labor under penal sanction, abusive forms of child labor, or exploitation of children in sweatshop labor. The contractor shall agree to comply with this provision of the contract.

(2) The contract shall specify that the contractor is required to cooperate fully in providing reasonable access to the contractor’s records, documents, agents, employees, or premises if reasonably required by authorized officials of the contracting agency, the Department of Industrial Relations, or the Department of Justice determine the contractor’s compliance with the requirements under paragraph (1).

Any state agency responsible for procurement shall ensure that the Sweatfree Code of Conduct is available for public review at least 30 calendar days between the dates of receipt and the final award of the contract. The Sweatfree Code of Conduct shall list the requirements that contractors are required to meet, as set forth in subdivision (g).

(2) Upon implementation in the manner described in paragraph (4), every contract entered into by any state agency for the procurement or laundering of apparel, garments, or corresponding accessories, or for the procurement of equipment or supplies, shall require that the contractor certify in accordance with the Sweatfree Code of Conduct that no apparel, garments, or corresponding accessories, or equipment, materials, or supplies, furnished to the state pursuant to the contract have been laundered or produced, in whole or in part, by sweatshop labor.

(3) The appropriate procurement agency, in consultation with the Director of Industrial Relations, shall employ a phased and targeted approach to implementing the Sweatfree Code of Conduct. Sweatfree Code of Conduct procurement policies involving apparel, garments, and corresponding accessories may be permitted a phasein period of up to one year for purposes of feasibility and providing sufficient notice to contractors and the general public. The appropriate procurement agency, in consultation with the Director of Industrial Relations, shall target other procurement categories based on the magnitude of verified sweatshop conditions and the feasibility of implementation, and may set phasein goals and timetables of up to three years to achieve compliance with the principles of the Sweatfree Code of Conduct.

(4) In order to facilitate compliance with the Sweatfree Code of Conduct, the Department of Industrial Relations shall explore mechanisms employed by other governmental entities, including, but not limited to, New Jersey Executive Order 20, of 2002, to ensure that businesses that contract with this state are in compliance with this section and any regulations or requirements promulgated in conformance with this section, as amended by Section 2 of Chapter 711 of the Statutes of 2003.

(3) Contractors and subcontractors shall ensure that workers are paid, at a minimum, wages and benefits in compliance with applicable local, state, and national laws of the jurisdiction in which the labor, on behalf of the contractor or subcontractor, is performed. Whenever a state agency expends funds for the procurement or laundering of apparel, garments, or corresponding accessories, or the procurement of equipment, materials, or supplies, other than procurement related to a public works contract, the applicable labor standards established by the local jurisdiction through the exercise of either local police powers or local spending powers in which the labor, in compliance with the contract or purchase order for which the expenditure is made, is performed shall apply with regard to the contract or purchase order for which the expenditure is made, unless the applicable local standards are in conflict with, or are explicitly preempted by, state law. A state agency may not require, as a condition for the receipt of state funds or assistance, that a local jurisdiction refrain from applying the labor standards that are otherwise applicable to that local jurisdiction. The Department of Industrial Relations may, without incurring additional expenses, access information from any nonprofit organization, including, but not limited to, the World Bank, that gathers and disseminates data with respect to wages paid throughout the world, to allow the Department of Industrial Relations to determine whether contractors and subcontractors are compensating their employees at a level that enables those employees to live above the applicable poverty level.

(4) All contractors and subcontractors shall comply with the overtime laws and regulations of the country in which their employees are working.

(5) All overtime hours shall be worked voluntarily. Workers shall be compensated for overtime at either (A) the rate of compensation for regular hours of work, or (B) as legally required in the country of manufacture, whichever is greater.

(6) No person may be employed who is younger than the legal age for children to work in the country in which the facility is located. In no case may children under the age of 15 years be employed in the manufacturing process. Where the age for completing compulsory education is higher than the standard for the minimum age of employment, the age for completing education shall apply to this section.

(7) There may be no form of forced labor of any kind, including slave labor, prison labor, indentured labor, or bonded labor, including forced overtime hours.

(8) The work environment shall be safe and healthy and, at a minimum, be in compliance with relevant local, state, and national laws. If residential facilities are provided to workers, those facilities shall be safe and healthy as well.

(9) There may be no discrimination in hiring, salary, benefits, performance evaluation, discipline, promotion, retirement, or dismissal on the basis of age, sex, pregnancy, maternity leave status, marital status, race, nationality, country of origin, ethnic origin, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, or political opinion.

(10) No worker may be subjected to any physical, sexual, psychological, or verbal harassment or abuse, including corporal punishment, under any circumstances, including, but not limited to, retaliation for exercising his or her right to free speech and assembly.

(11) No worker may be forced to use contraceptives or take pregnancy tests. No worker may be exposed to chemicals, including glues and solvents, that endanger reproductive health.

(12) Contractors and bidders shall list the names and addresses of each subcontractor to be utilized in the performance of the contract, and list each manufacturing or other facility or operation of the contractor or subcontractor for performance of the contract. The list, which shall be maintained and updated to show any changes in subcontractors during the term of the contract, shall provide company names, owners or officers, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, and the nature of the business association.

(h) Any person who certifies as true any material matter pursuant to this section that he or she knows to be false is guilty of a misdemeanor.

(i) The provisions of this section, as amended by Section 2 of Chapter 711 of the Statutes of 2003, shall be in addition to any other provisions that authorize the prosecution and enforcement of local labor laws and may not be interpreted to prohibit a local prosecutor from bringing a criminal or civil action against an individual or business that violates the provisions of this section.

(j) (1) The certification requirements set forth in subdivisions (a) and (f) do not apply to a credit card purchase of goods of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) or less.

(2) The total amount of exemption authorized herein shall not exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) per year for each company from which a state agency is purchasing goods by credit card. It shall be the responsibility of each state agency to monitor the use of this exemption and adhere to these restrictions on these purchases.

##### CHAPTER 6.6. Alternative Project Delivery Program: Construction Manager/General Contractor Authority [6950 - 6958]  

######### 6950.  
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) The alternative public works project delivery methods authorized under this chapter should be evaluated for the purposes of exploring whether the potential exists for reduced project costs, expedited project completion, or design features that are not achievable through the traditional project delivery methods.

(b) The design sequencing and Construction Manager/General Contractor project delivery methods rely on existing design-bid-build and design-build procurement methods respectively and have been successfully used by both public and private sector entities in California and other states for over a decade on projects that require a quick startup as they allow construction to begin before the design plans are complete for the entire project.

(c) Both methods also have the benefit of allowing for earlier collaboration between the project owner and construction contractor.

(d) This chapter shall not be deemed to provide a preference for these project delivery methods over other delivery methodologies.



######### 6951.  
For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions apply:

(a) “Alternative project delivery method” means either Construction Manager/General Contractor method or design sequencing.

(b) “Construction Manager/General Contractor method” or “CMGC” means a project delivery method using a best value procurement process in which a construction manager is procured to provide preconstruction services during the design phase of the project and construction services during the construction phase of the project. The execution of the design and the construction of the project may be in sequential phases or concurrent phases.

(c) “Construction manager” means a partnership, corporation, or other legal entity that is able to provide appropriately licensed contracting and engineering services as needed pursuant to a CMGC contract.

(d) “Design sequencing” means a method of project delivery that enables the sequencing of design activities to permit each construction phase to commence when the design for that phase is complete, instead of requiring design for the entire project to be completed before commencing construction.

(e) “Department” means the Department of Transportation as established under Part 5 (commencing with Section 14000) of Division 3 of the Government Code.

(f) “San Diego Association of Governments” means the consolidated agency created pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 132350) of Division 12.7 of the Public Utilities Code.



######### 6952.

The preconstruction services contract may include fees for services to be performed during the contract period; provided, however, the San Diego Association of Governments shall not request or obtain a fixed price or a guaranteed maximum price for the construction contract from the construction manager or enter into a construction contract with the construction manager until after the San Diego Association of Governments has entered into a services contract. A preconstruction services contract shall provide for the subsequent negotiation for construction of all or any discrete phase or phases of the project and shall provide for the San Diego Association of Governments to own the design plans and other preconstruction services work product.

(b) A contract for construction services will be awarded after the plans have been sufficiently developed and either a fixed price or a guaranteed maximum price has been successfully negotiated. In the event that a fixed price or a guaranteed maximum price is not negotiated, the San Diego Association of Governments may award the contract for construction services utilizing any other procurement method authorized by law.

(c) The construction manager shall perform not less than 30 percent of the work covered by the fixed price or guaranteed maximum price agreement reached. Work that is not performed directly by the construction manager shall be bid to subcontractors pursuant to Section 6955.



######### 6955.  
All subcontractors bidding on contracts pursuant to this chapter shall be afforded the protections contained in Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 4100).

(b) Contracts awarded pursuant to this section shall be valid until the project is completed.








##### CHAPTER 6.7. Construction Manager/General Contractor Method: Regional Projects on Expressways [6970 - 6974]  

######### 6970.  
(a) This chapter provides for an alternative procurement procedure for certain transportation projects performed by a regional transportation agency.

(b) The Construction Manager/General Contractor method allows the regional transportation agency to engage a construction manager during the design process to provide input on the design. During the design phase, the construction manager provides advice including, but not limited to, scheduling, pricing, and phasing to assist the agency to design a more constructible project.

(c) The Legislature finds and declares that utilizing a Construction Manager/General Contractor method requires a clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities of each participant in the process. The Legislature also finds and declares that cost-effective benefits are achieved by shifting the liability and risk for cost containment and project schedule to the construction manager and by permitting the coherent phasing of projects into discrete contract increments.



######### 6971.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares that the County of Riverside should be considered a transportation planning agency for the purposes of this chapter in order to effectuate the construction of the railroad grade separations and bridge rehabilitations and replacements specified in subparagraph (C) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) using Construction Manager/General Contractor authority. The passage of the Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017 (Chapter 5 of the Statutes of 2017) provides additional transportation revenue to help close the significant funding shortfalls and address the substantial backlog of infrastructure projects that are in need of repair. The geography, topography, and location of these railroad grade separations and bridge rehabilitations and replacements projects present many potential complex challenges, and the Construction Manager/General Contractor method could reduce delays and ensure that those challenges are fully understood at the outset of construction.

(b) For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions apply:

(1) “Construction manager” means a partnership, corporation, or other legal entity that is a licensed contractor pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code and that is able to provide, or that contracts with entities that are able to provide, appropriately licensed contracting or engineering services, or both appropriately licensed contracting and engineering services, as needed pursuant to a Construction Manager/General Contractor method contract.

(2) “Construction Manager/General Contractor method” means a project delivery method in which a construction manager is procured to provide preconstruction services during the design phase of the project and construction services during the construction phase of the project. The contract for construction services may be entered into at the same time as the contract for preconstruction services, or at a later time. The execution of the design and the construction of the project may be in sequential phases or concurrent phases.

(3) “Preconstruction services” means advice during the design phase, including, but not limited to, scheduling, pricing, and phasing to assist the regional transportation agency to design a more constructible project.

(4) “Project” means any of the following:

(A) The construction of an expressway that is not on the state highway system.

(B) The construction of the following bridges that are not on the state highway system:

##### CHAPTER 6.8. High Road Jobs in Transportation-Related Public Contracts and Grants Pilot Program [6980 - 6986]  

######### 6980.  
This chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the High Road Jobs in Transportation-Related Public Contracts and Grants Pilot Program.



######### 6981.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(1) In a time of uncertainty with so many Americans out of work, employment stability and equity are a primary concern.

(2) Spending on green investments creates more jobs per dollar than other infrastructure investments and these jobs are accessible and well paying. Every one million dollars ($1,000,000) in spending on renewable energy creates 7.5 full-time jobs.

(3) Historically vulnerable groups have been disproportionately impacted by economic downturns. For example, for every one percentage point increase in the overall unemployment rate, there is a 1.8-percent increase in African American unemployment.

(4) It is essential that the state, in cooperation with the federal government, use all practical and commercially feasible means to promote the prompt and efficient development of energy sources that are renewable or that more efficiently use and conserve scarce energy resources.

(5) It is in the public interest to do all of the following:

(A) Prioritize reversing factors that have resulted in disproportionate health impacts and economic suffering due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic among California’s low-income communities, communities of color, and immigrant communities that have historically faced underinvestment and discriminatory policies.

(B) Promote sustainable and renewable energy sources, implement measures that increase efficient energy use, advance transportation technologies that reduce the degradation of the environment, lessen the state’s dependence of fossil fuels, and protect the health, welfare, and safety of the people of this state.

(C) Spend resources to avoid recreating historical patterns of injustice by allocating resources in a manner that will create a just transition to a green, regenerative economy, founded on climate, racial, and economic justice, that puts an end to extreme inequality and systemic racial injustice, and ensures all Californians have a clean and safe environment in which to live, work, and play.

(D) Support a just recovery where workers from all sectors who have lost wages or jobs as a direct result of the pandemic will be prioritized for new employment opportunities that guarantee family-sustaining incomes, pensions, benefit training, retraining, and early retirement assistance.

(E) Require recovery spending to include a mandate for a robust, fully funded public sector that includes significant investments in job creation and community development with a particular focus on a just transition for affected workers.

(F) Expend resources in a broadly inclusive economic and democratic process that ensures robust, accessible opportunities for all Californians to determine the future of our government and economy.

The extra compensation to the contractor shall be 50 percent of the net savings in construction costs as determined by the public entity. For projects under the supervision of the Department of Transportation or local or regional transportation entities, the extra compensation to the contractor shall be 60 percent of the net savings, if the cost reduction changes significantly reduce or avoid traffic congestion during construction of the project, in the opinion of the public entity. The contractor may not be required to perform the changes contained in an eligible change proposal submitted in compliance with the provisions of the contract unless the proposal was accepted by the public entity.



######### 7102.  
Contract provisions in construction contracts of public agencies and subcontracts thereunder which limit the contractee’s liability to an extension of time for delay for which the contractee is responsible and which delay is unreasonable under the circumstances involved, and not within the contemplation of the parties, shall not be construed to preclude the recovery of damages by the contractor or subcontractor.

No public agency may require the waiver, alteration, or limitation of the applicability of this section. Any such waiver, alteration, or limitation is void. This section shall not be construed to void any provision in a construction contract which requires notice of delays, provides for arbitration or other procedure for settlement, or provides for liquidated damages.

The contractor shall retain any and all rights provided either by contract or by law which pertain to the resolution of disputes and protests between the contracting parties.



######### 7105.

However, contracts may include provisions for terminating the contract. The requirements of this section shall not be mandatory as to construction contracts financed by revenue bonds. This section shall not prohibit a public agency from requiring that a contractor obtain insurance to indemnify the public agency for any damage to the work caused by an act of God if the insurance premium is a separate bid item.

##### ARTICLE 1.5. Minority and Women Business Participation Goals for State Contracts [10115 - 10115.15]  

######### 10115.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(1) The essence of the American economic system of private enterprise is free competition. Only through full and free competition can free markets, reasonable and just prices, free entry into business, and opportunities for the expression and growth of personal initiative and individual judgment be assured. The preservation and expansion of that competition is basic to the economic well-being of this state and that well-being cannot be realized unless the actual and potential capacity of minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprises is encouraged and developed. Therefore, it is the declared policy of the state to aid the interests of minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprises in order to preserve reasonable and just prices and a free competitive enterprise, to ensure that a fair proportion of the total number of contracts or subcontracts for commodities, supplies, technology, property, and services are awarded to minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the state.

(2) The opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprises is essential if this state is to attain social and economic equality for those businesses and improve the functioning of the state economy.

(3) State agencies which have established short- and long-range minority, women, and disabled veteran participation goals are awarding 23 percent or more of their contracts to these business enterprises.

(4) It is in the state’s interest to expeditiously improve the economically disadvantaged position of minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprises.

(5) The economic position of these businesses can be improved by providing long-range substantial goals for procurement by state agencies of commodities, professional services, and construction work from minority, women, and disabled veteran businesses.

(6) Procurement by state agencies of goods and services from these businesses also benefits the state agencies and the citizens of the state by encouraging the expansion of the number of vendors for procurements, thereby encouraging competition among the vendors and promoting economic efficiency in the process.

(b) It is the purpose of this article to do all of the following:

(1) Encourage greater economic opportunity for minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprises.

(2) Promote competition among state agencies in order to enhance long-term economic efficiency in the procurement of construction, commodities, and professional services contracts.

(3) Clarify and expand the program for the procurement by state agencies of commodities, professional services, and construction work from minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprises.

Notwithstanding the project cost limit provided in Section 10105, work in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) which would otherwise constitute a project, shall not be done by day’s labor unless the requirements of Section 10122 are met.



######### 10123.  
Contracts upon informal bids authorized under Section 10122 shall be let only to a holder of a valid state contractor’s license unless such work is exempt from such licensing requirement by any other provision of law.



######### 10124.  
Bids may be received and contracts awarded on a unit basis, that is, the bids compared upon the basis of estimates of the quantities of the work to be done.



######### 10125.  
Except in unit basis contracts, contracts shall not be made exceeding in amount the estimates of costs approved by the director and plans and specifications and estimates of costs including expense of advertising and inspection, shall not be approved by the director requiring a greater expenditure of money than is appropriated for the specific purpose in the law authorizing the expenditure.



######### 10126.  
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10125, the estimate of cost may be approved by the director, which includes alternates contemplating additions to, or deletions from, the base bid, provided that all of the following requirements are met:

(a) Estimates are made for each contingency and, in the aggregate, the alternates do not exceed 10 percent of the estimated cost for the project.

(b) The available funds are at least sufficient to cover the filed estimate for the base project.

(c) Whenever additive or deductive items are included in a bid, the bid solicitation shall specify which one of the following methods will be used to determine the lowest bid. In the absence of such a specification, only the method provided by paragraph (1) will be used:

(1) The lowest bid shall be the lowest bid price on the base contract without consideration of the prices on the additive or deductive items.

(2) The lowest bid shall be the lowest total of the bid prices on the base contract and those additive or deductive items that were specifically identified in the bid solicitation as being used for the purpose of determining the lowest bid price.

(3) The lowest bid shall be the lowest total of the bid prices on the base contract and those additive or deductive items that, when taken in order from a specifically identified list of those items in the solicitation, and added to, or subtracted from, the base contract, are less than, or equal to, a funding amount publicly disclosed by the department before the first bid is opened.

(4) The lowest bid shall be determined in a manner that prevents any information that would identify any of the bidders or proposed subcontractors or suppliers from being revealed to the public entity before the ranking of all bidders from lowest to highest has been determined.

(d) The contract is awarded to the lowest bidder, as determined by the method prescribed in subdivision (c).

(e) A responsible bidder who submitted the lowest bid as determined by this section shall be awarded the contract, if it is awarded. This section does not preclude the department from adding to or deducting from the contract any of the additive or deductive items after the lowest responsible bidder has been determined.

(f) Nothing in this section shall preclude the prequalification of subcontractors.



######### 10127.  
The department may, with the approval of the State Public Works Board, receive bids for the construction of several public works projects as a single project. Where more than one appropriation has been made for the several projects united as a single project under the provisions of this section, payments for the single project shall be made from the separate appropriations on the proportional basis that may be determined by the department and approved by the Department of Finance. In the case of several projects united as a single project pursuant to this section, those projects shall be within 100 miles of one another.



######### 10128.  
All contracts awarded under this part shall comply with the applicable provisions of Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 1720) of Part 7 of Division 2 of the Labor Code relating to public works contracts and shall contain all the contract provisions required therein.



######### 10129.  
(a) Notwithstanding Section 3400, no agency of the state charged with the letting of contracts for the construction, alteration, or repair of public works may draft or cause to be drafted specifications for bids, in connection with the construction, alteration, or repair of public works, (1) in a manner that limits the bidding, directly or indirectly, to any one specific concern, or (2) calling for a designated material, product, thing, or service by specific brand or trade name unless the specification is followed by the words “or equal” so that bidders may furnish any equal material, product, thing, or service. In applying this section, the awarding authority shall, if aware of an equal product manufactured in this state, name that product in the specification. Specifications shall provide a period of time prior to or after, or prior to and after, the award of the contract for submission of data substantiating a request for a substitution of “an equal” item. If no time period is specified, data may be submitted any time within 35 days after the award of the contract.

(b) Subdivision (a) is not applicable if the awarding authority, or its designee, makes a finding that is described in the invitation for bids or request for proposals that a particular material, product, thing, or service is designated by specific brand or trade name for any of the following purposes:

(1) In order that a field test or experiment may be made to determine the product’s suitability for future use.

(2) In order to match other products in use on a particular public improvement either completed or in the course of completion.

(3) In order to obtain a necessary item that is only available from one source.

(4) In order to respond to an emergency declared by the state, a state agency, or political subdivision of the state, but only if the facts setting forth the reasons for the finding of the emergency are contained in the public records of the authority issuing the invitation for bid or request for proposals.









##### ARTICLE 3. Advertisements for Bids [10140 - 10141]  

######### 10140.  
(a) Public notice of a project shall be given by publication once a week for at least two consecutive weeks or once a week for more than two consecutive weeks if the longer period of advertising is deemed necessary by the department, as follows:

(1) In a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the project is located, or if located in more than one county, in such a newspaper in a county in which a major portion of the work is to be done.

(2) In a trade paper of general circulation published in San Francisco for projects located in County Group No. 1, as defined in Section 187 of the Streets and Highways Code, or in Los Angeles for projects located in County Group No. 2, as defined in Section 187 of the Streets and Highways Code, devoted primarily to the dissemination of contract and building news among contracting and building materials supply firms.

(b) The department may publish the notice to bidders for a project in additional trade papers or newspapers of general circulation that it deems advisable.

(c) (1) In the case of the Department of Transportation, instead of the public notice described in subdivision (a), the public notice requirement of this section may instead be met by publishing the public notice electronically on that department’s Internet Web site.

(2) If the department exercises its authority under paragraph (1), the department shall also publish information regarding notices listed on the department’s Internet Web site in trade papers, newspapers, or magazines, as appropriate in order to ensure all communities have access to the public notice, including those publications whose primary audience consists of underrepresented groups, including, but not limited to, women, minorities, LGBT, and disabled veterans, pursuant to the frequency requirements specified in subdivision (a).



######### 10141.  
The notice shall state the time and place for the receiving and opening of sealed bids, describing in general terms the work to be done and that the bids will be required for the entire project and for the performance of separate designated parts of the entire project, when the department determines that segregation is advisable.









##### ARTICLE 4. Bids and Bidders [10160 - 10169]  

######### 10160.  
The department may require from prospective bidders answers to questions contained in a standard form of questionnaire and financial statement including a complete statement of the prospective bidder’s financial ability and experience in performing public works. When completed, the questionnaire and financial statement shall be verified under oath by the bidder in the manner in which pleadings in civil actions are verified.

Whenever prequalification is required of any bidder on a contract, it shall be required for all prospective bidders to that contract.



######### 10161.  
The department may also require from prospective bidders the completion, under penalty of perjury, of a standard form of questionnaire concerning the past safety record of each prospective bidder, any officer of such bidder, and any managing employee of such bidder. The department may refuse to prequalify any prospective bidder who fails to submit a completed questionnaire when required, or for the reason that the information contained in the submitted questionnaire or otherwise known to the department indicates a continuing unsatisfactory safety record.

The director of the department shall prescribe guidelines listing criteria which will be utilized administratively in determining an unsatisfactory safety record. A refusal by the department to prequalify a prospective bidder shall be issued only after the department has granted such bidder a hearing.

This section shall in no way abridge or restrict the right of the department to later determine whether the low bidder on a particular project is the lowest responsible bidder for purposes of award of the contract, including the holding of hearings thereon.

The Director of Industrial Relations shall approve the standard form of questionnaire and the guidelines listing criteria which will be utilized administratively by the department in determining an unsatisfactory safety record prior to their use by the department.



######### 10162.  
The department shall require from all prospective bidders the completion, under penalty of perjury, of a standard form of questionnaire inquiring whether such prospective bidder, any officer of such bidder, or any employee of such bidder who has a proprietary interest in such bidder, has ever been disqualified, removed, or otherwise prevented from bidding on, or completing a federal, state, or local government project because of a violation of law or a safety regulation, and if so to explain the circumstances.

A bid may be rejected on the basis of a bidder, any officer of such bidder, or any employee of such bidder who has a proprietary interest in such bidder, having been disqualified, removed, or otherwise prevented from bidding on, or completing a federal, state, or local project because of a violation of law or a safety regulation.



######### 10163.  
The department shall adopt and apply a uniform system of rating bidders, on the basis of the standard questionnaires and financial statements, in respect to the size of the contracts upon which each bidder is qualified to bid. When bids for more than one project are to be received at the same bid opening, the department may permit a bidder to submit bids for each project within such bidder’s prequalification rating, even though such rating is insufficient to permit the bidder to be awarded the contract for each project bid upon.

In no event shall any bidder be awarded a contract if such contract award would result in the bidder having under contract work for which prequalification is required in excess of that authorized by his prequalification rating. In determining whether an award of a contract would result in a bidder having under contract work in excess of that authorized by his prequalification rating, the department may use its estimated cost of such contract rather than the amount of the bidder’s bid. If the department determines that a bidder would be awarded the contract for two or more projects but cannot be awarded the contract for all such projects because of the inadequacy of his prequalification rating, the department shall determine which of the bids of such bidder are to be accepted and the contract awarded thereon and which of the bids of such bidder are to be disregarded. In making its decision the department shall be guided by the combination of contract awards which will result in the lowest total cost for the projects involved.



######### 10164.  
In all state projects where federal funds are involved, no bid submitted shall be invalidated by the failure of the bidder to be licensed in accordance with the laws of this state. However, at the time the contract is awarded, the contractor shall be properly licensed in accordance with the laws of this state. The contract shall not be awarded unless the state agency has verified that the contractor has a valid license in the appropriate classification for the work performed. Any bidder or contractor not so licensed shall be subject to all legal penalties imposed by law, including, but not limited to, any appropriate disciplinary action by the Contractors State License Board. The department shall include a statement to that effect in the standard form of prequalification questionnaire and financial statement. Failure of the bidder to obtain proper and adequate licensing for an award of a contract shall constitute a failure to execute the contract as provided in Section 10181 and shall result in the forfeiture of the security of the bidder.



######### 10165.  
The questionnaires and financial statements are not public records and are not open to public inspection.



######### 10166.  
The department shall furnish to each bidder a standard proposal form, which, when filled out and executed may be submitted as his bid. Bids not presented on forms so furnished shall be disregarded. The department shall not furnish proposal forms to any person who is required to submit and has not submitted a questionnaire and financial statement for prequalification at least five days prior to the date fixed for publicly opening sealed bids and been prequalified for at least one day prior to that date.



######### 10167.  
(a) All bids shall be presented under sealed cover and accompanied by one of the following forms of bidder’s security:

(1) An electronic bidder’s bond by an admitted surety insurer submitted using an electronic registry service approved by the department advertising the contract.

(2) A signed bidder’s bond by an admitted surety insurer received by the department advertising the contract.

(3) Cash, a cashier’s check, or certified check received by, and made payable to, the director of the department advertising the contract.

(b) The required bidder’s security shall be in an amount equal to at least 10 percent of the amount bid. A bid shall not be considered unless one of the forms of bidder’s security is enclosed with it.

(c) All bids submitted pursuant to this section shall also comply with the provisions of Section 1601 of the Public Contract Code.



######### 10168.  
Whether or not bids are opened exactly at the time fixed in the public notice for opening bids, a bid shall not be received after that time.



######### 10169.  
Any bid may be withdrawn at any time prior to the time fixed in the public notice for the opening of bids only by written request for the withdrawal of the bid filed with the director of the department or the chief of the division under which the work is to be performed. The request shall be executed by the bidder or his duly authorized representative. The withdrawal of a bid does not prejudice the right of the bidder to file a new bid.

This section does not authorize the withdrawal of any bid after the time fixed in the public notice for the opening of bids.









##### ARTICLE 5. Award of Contracts [10180 - 10186]  

######### 10180.  
On the day named in the public notice, the department shall publicly open the sealed bids and award the contracts to the lowest responsible bidders.

In the case of bids opened by a district director, pursuant to Section 10141, he shall report the contents thereof to the director. In all other respects, the contracts shall be awarded as are other contracts.



######### 10181.  
If the successful bidder fails to execute the contract, his bidder’s security shall be forfeited to the state. The cash or proceeds shall be deposited in the fund out of which the expenses of preparation and printing of the plans and specifications, estimates of cost, and publication of notice are paid.



######### 10182.  
If the director deems it is for the best interests of the state, he may, on the refusal or failure of the successful bidder to execute the contract, award it to the second lowest responsible bidder.

If the second lowest responsible bidder fails or refuses to execute the contract, the director may likewise award it to the third lowest responsible bidder. 

On the failure or refusal of the second or third lowest bidder, to whom a contract is so awarded, to execute it, his bidder’s security shall be likewise forfeited to the state.



######### 10183.  
The failure of the successful bidder to furnish any bond required of him by law, within the time fixed for his execution of the contract, constitutes a failure to execute the contract.



######### 10184.  
The bidders’ security of the second and third lowest responsible bidders may be withheld until the contract has been finally executed. The cash, cashier’s checks and certified checks submitted by all other unsuccessful bidders shall be returned to them within 10 days after the contract is awarded, and their bidders’ bonds shall be of no further effect.



######### 10185.  
If the director deems the acceptance of the lowest responsible bid or bids is not for the best interests of the state, after stating his or her reasons for rejecting the bid or bids, the director may reject all bids and proceed by day’s labor or advertise for other bids in the manner required by this part.



######### 10186.  
(a) This section shall be known, and may be cited, as the “Fair Chance Employment Act.”

(b) Any person submitting a bid to the state on a contract involving onsite construction-related services shall certify that the person will not ask an applicant for onsite construction-related employment to disclose orally or in writing information concerning the conviction history of the applicant on or at the time of an initial employment application.

(c) This section shall not apply to a position for which the person or the state is otherwise required by state or federal law to conduct a conviction history background check or to any contract position with a criminal justice agency, as that term is defined in Section 13101 of the Penal Code.

(d) This section shall not apply to a person to the extent that he or she obtains workers from a hiring hall pursuant to a bona fide collective bargaining agreement.









##### ARTICLE 6. State Agency Design-Build Projects [10187 - 10196]  

######### 10187.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares that the design-build method of project delivery, using a best value procurement methodology, has been authorized for various agencies that have reported benefits from such projects including reduced project costs, expedited project completion, and design features that are not achievable through the traditional design-bid-build method.

(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that the following occur:

(1) This article provides general authorization for certain state agencies to use design-build for projects, excluding projects on the state highway system.

(2) This article shall not be deemed to provide a preference for the design-build method over other procurement methodologies.



######### 10187.5.  
For purposes of this article, the following definitions and the definitions in subdivision (a) of Section 13332.19 of the Government Code shall apply:

(a) “Best value” means a value determined by evaluation of objective criteria that relate to price, features, functions, life-cycle costs, experience, and past performance. A best value determination may involve the selection of the lowest cost proposal meeting the interests of the department and meeting the objectives of the project, selection of the best proposal for a stipulated sum established by the procuring agency, or a tradeoff between price and other specified factors.

(b) “Construction subcontract” means each subcontract awarded by the design-build entity to a subcontractor that will perform work or labor or render service to the design-build entity in or about the construction of the work or improvement, or a subcontractor licensed by the State of California that, under subcontract to the design-build entity, specially fabricates and installs a portion of the work or improvement according to detailed drawings contained in the plans and specifications produced by the design-build team.

(c) “Department” means the Department of General Services, the Military Department, and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

(a) Notwithstanding any other law, the director, following notification to the State Public Works Board, may procure design-build contracts for public works projects in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000), awarding the contract using either the low bid or best value, provided that this article shall not apply to any projects on the state highway system.

(b) The director shall develop guidelines for a standard organizational conflict-of-interest policy, consistent with applicable law, regarding the ability of a person or entity, that performs services for the department relating to the solicitation of a design-build project, to submit a proposal as a design-build entity, or to join a design-build team. This conflict-of-interest policy shall apply to each department entering into design-build contracts authorized under this article.



######### 10190.  
The director shall notify the State Public Works Board regarding the method to be used for selecting the design-build entity, prior to advertising the design-build project.



######### 10191.  
The procurement process for the design-build projects shall progress as follows:

(a) (1) The director shall prepare a set of documents setting forth the scope and estimated price of the project. The documents may include, but need not be limited to, the size, type, and desired design character of the project, performance specifications covering the quality of materials, equipment, workmanship, preliminary plans or building layouts, or any other information deemed necessary to describe adequately the department’s needs. The performance specifications and any plans shall be prepared by a design professional who is duly licensed and registered in California.

(d) Based on the documents prepared as described in subdivision (a), the director shall prepare a request for proposals that invites prequalified or short-listed entities to submit competitive sealed proposals in the manner prescribed by the department. The request for proposals shall include, but need not be limited to, the following elements:

(1) Identification of the basic scope and needs of the project or contract, the estimated cost of the project, the methodology that will be used by the department to evaluate proposals, whether the contract will be awarded on the basis of low bid or best value, and any other information deemed necessary by the department to inform interested parties of the contracting opportunity.

(2) Significant factors that the department reasonably expects to consider in evaluating proposals, including, but not limited to, cost or price and all nonprice-related factors.

(3) The relative importance or the weight assigned to each of the factors identified in the request for proposals.

(4) Where a best value selection method is used, the department may reserve the right to request proposal revisions and hold discussions and negotiations with responsive proposers, in which case the department shall so specify in the request for proposals and shall publish separately or incorporate into the request for proposals applicable procedures to be observed by the department to ensure that any discussions or negotiations are conducted in good faith.

(e) For those projects utilizing low bid as the final selection method, the competitive bidding process shall result in lump-sum bids by the prequalified or short-listed design-build entities, and awards shall be made to the design-build entity that is the lowest responsible bidder.

(f) For those projects utilizing best value as a selection method, the design-build competition shall progress as follows:

(1) Competitive proposals shall be evaluated by using only the criteria and selection procedures specifically identified in the request for proposals. The following minimum factors, however, shall be weighted as deemed appropriate by the department:

(A) Price, unless a stipulated sum is specified.

(B) Technical design and construction expertise.

(C) Life-cycle costs over 15 or more years.

(2) Pursuant to subdivision (d), the department may hold discussions or negotiations with responsive proposers using the process articulated in the department’s request for proposals.

(4) The award of the contract shall be made to the responsible design-build entity whose proposal is determined by the director to have offered the best value to the public.

(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, upon issuance of a contract award, the director shall publicly announce its award, identifying the design-build entity to which the award is made, along with a statement regarding the basis of the award.

(6) The statement regarding the director’s contract award, described in paragraph (5), and the contract file shall provide sufficient information to satisfy an external audit.



######### 10192.

All construction subcontractors that are identified in the proposal shall be afforded all the protections of Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 4100) of Part 1.

(b) Following award of the design-build contract, the design-build entity shall proceed as follows in awarding construction subcontracts with a value exceeding one-half of 1 percent of the contract price allocable to construction work:

(1) Provide public notice of availability of work to be subcontracted in accordance with the publication requirements applicable to the competitive bidding process of the department, including a fixed date and time on which qualifications statements, bids, or proposals will be due.

(2) Establish reasonable qualification criteria and standards.

(3) Award the subcontract either on a best value basis or to the lowest responsible bidder. The process may include prequalification or short-listing. The foregoing process does not apply to construction subcontractors listed in the original proposal. Subcontractors awarded construction subcontracts under this subdivision shall be afforded all the protections of Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 4100) of Part 1.



######### 10194.  
(a) If the department elects to award a project pursuant to this article, retention proceeds withheld by the department from the design-build entity shall not exceed 5 percent if a performance and payment bond, issued by an admitted surety insurer, is required in the solicitation of bids.

(b) In a contract between the design-build entity and a subcontractor, and in a contract between a subcontractor and any subcontractor thereunder, the percentage of the retention proceeds withheld may not exceed the percentage specified in the contract between the department and the design-build entity. If the design-build entity provides written notice to any subcontractor that is not a member of the design-build entity, prior to or at the time the bid is requested, that a bond may be required and the subcontractor subsequently is unable or refuses to furnish a bond to the design-build entity, then the design-build entity may withhold retention proceeds in excess of the percentage specified in the contract between the department and the design-build entity from any payment made by the design-build entity to the subcontractor.



######### 10195.  
Nothing in this article affects, expands, alters, or limits any rights or remedies otherwise available at law.

If the parties cannot agree on the arbitrator, either party may petition the superior court to appoint one from the panel of arbitrators certified by the Public Works Contract Arbitration Committee.



######### 10240.4.  
No decision made by a department shall be conclusive on any issue in the arbitration.



######### 10240.5.  
(a) The Departments of General Services, Transportation, and Water Resources shall jointly adopt and may, from time to time, modify, revise, or repeal uniform regulations to implement this article, which regulations shall be consistent with this article and Article 7.2 (commencing with Section 10245). The regulations may include, but need not be limited to:

(1) The method of initiating arbitration.

(2) The place of hearing based upon the convenience of the parties.

(3) Procedures for the selection of a neutral arbitrator.

(4) The form and content of any pleading.

(5) Procedure for conducting hearings.

(6) The providing of experts to assist the arbitrator in the event the assistance is needed.

(7) The content of the award.

(8) Simplified procedures for claims of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or less.

(b) Pending adoption of the initial uniform regulations under this section, the arbitration rules set forth in Subchapter 3 (commencing with Section 301) of Chapter 2 of Title 1 of the California Code of Regulations, shall govern the conduct of arbitrations under this chapter.



######### 10240.6.  
As used in this article, “claim” means a demand for monetary compensation or damages, arising under or relating to the performance of a contract awarded under this chapter.



######### 10240.7.  
As used in this article, “Public Works Contract Arbitration Committee” means the committee created by Article 7.2 (commencing with Section 10245).



######### 10240.8.  
Unless the parties to the contract otherwise agree, the arbitration decision shall be decided under and in accordance with the law of this state, supported by substantial evidence and, in writing, contain the basis for the decision, findings of fact, and conclusions of law.



######### 10240.9.  
A party to the contract may join in the arbitration as a party, any supplier, subcontractor, design professional, surety, or other person who has so agreed and if the joinder is necessary to prevent a substantial risk of the party otherwise being subjected to inconsistent obligations or decisions.



######### 10240.10.  
Nothing in this article shall be construed as preventing the parties to the contract, after the claim has arisen, from mutually agreeing in writing to waive the provisions of this article and to have the claim litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction.



######### 10240.11.  
Except as provided in this article and in the regulations adopted pursuant to Section 10240.5, the procedure governing the arbitrations shall be as set forth in Title 9 (commencing with Section 1280) of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure. All provisions of Section 1283.05 of the Code of Civil Procedure, except subdivision (e) thereof, apply to the conduct of discovery for any arbitration hereunder.



######### 10240.12.  
A party may, within the applicable time periods and upon the grounds specified in this section and in Article 1 (commencing with Section 1285) of Chapter 4 of Title 9 of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, petition the court to confirm, correct, or vacate the award rendered by the arbitrator. However, no department may petition to vacate an award without the prior written authorization of its agency secretary. Except where the parties agree not to have the arbitration decision rendered in accordance with the provisions of Section 10240.8, a court shall vacate the award, or part thereof, if it determines either that the award, or part thereof, is not supported by substantial evidence or that it is not decided under or in accordance with the laws of this state. If the award, or part thereof, is vacated on the grounds set forth in the preceding sentence or in subdivision (d) or (e) of Section 1286.2 of the Code of Civil Procedure or if the court determines that the award does not include a determination of all submitted questions necessary to determine the controversy, the court may order a rehearing before the original arbitrator or remand to the original arbitrator that portion of the dispute which the court concludes the arbitrator failed to determine.



######### 10240.13.  
The cost of conducting the arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties. The filing fee, witness fees, costs of discovery, or any other cost necessarily incurred by one party shall not be shared by any other party, except that the arbitrator may allow the prevailing party to recover its costs and necessary disbursements, other than attorney’s fees, on the same basis as is allowed in civil actions. These costs shall be taxed as in civil actions.

Interest may be recovered as part of the award as in a civil action. The arbitrator has the same authority as a court in awarding interest and the commencement of the arbitration is equivalent to the filing of an action under subdivision (b) of Section 3287 of the Civil Code for the purpose of an award of interest. 

If a party has made an offer of settlement and the award is less favorable than the offer, then the party who has received the offer shall not recover any interest accruing from and after the date on which the offer was made, nor costs of suit.

Reasonable attorney fees may be recovered according to any of the following:

(a) By a party who has made an offer under the circumstances set forth in the preceding sentence but only as to those fees incurred from and after the time of making the offer.

(b) Against a party when substantial evidence establishes that the party has acted frivolously or in bad faith in its demand for, or participation in, the arbitration.









##### ARTICLE 7.2. Public Works Contract Arbitration Committee [10245 - 10245.4]  

######### 10245.  
There is hereby established the Public Works Contract Arbitration Committee, which shall consist of seven members, as follows:

(a) Three public members, who shall be appointed by the Governor, each of whom shall have at least ten years’ experience with a general contracting firm engaged, during that period, in public works construction in California.

(b) The directors of the Departments of General Services, Transportation, and Water Resources shall each appoint a member, who shall be a state officer or employee within their respective departments. Each member shall serve at the pleasure of the director who appointed the member.

(c) The Director of the Office of Administrative Hearings shall be a nonvoting member of the Public Works Contract Arbitration Committee.



######### 10245.1.  
Each member appointed by the Governor shall serve for a term of four years, but shall continue in office until the successor to the member is appointed. Each member shall serve without compensation, but shall be reimbursed for travel and other expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of the member’s duties.



######### 10245.2.  
The committee may make recommendations to the departments respecting the arbitration practice and procedure provided by Article 7.1 (commencing with Section 10240). The departments shall consult and confer with the committee respecting the content of the uniform regulations governing the conduct of arbitrations under Article 7.1 (commencing with Section 10240) and shall consider the recommendations in adopting uniform regulations pursuant to Section 10240.5.



######### 10245.3.  
The committee may establish standards and qualifications for the certification of arbitrators and certify as arbitrators persons meeting such standards and qualifications. The committee may remove persons from its list of certified arbitrators.



######### 10245.4.  
The Office of Administrative Hearings shall provide administrative services, facilities, and fiscal support to implement this article and Article 7.1 (commencing with Section 10240). The cost thereof shall be recovered through filing fees imposed for each arbitration.









##### ARTICLE 8. Modifications; Performance; Payment [10250 - 10265]  

######### 10250.  
The department may increase or decrease quantities of work to be done under a unit basis contract during the progress of the work.



######### 10251.  
The department may cause the insertion of provisions in any contract for the performance of such extra work and the furnishing of materials therefor by the contractor as the department requires for the proper completion or construction of the whole work contemplated, if the bidders have equal opportunity of knowing the proposed terms for the extra work.



######### 10252.  
The director may grant such extensions of time for completion as he deems for the best interests of the state.



######### 10253.  
If the director deems that a contractor has failed to supply an adequate working force, or material of proper quality, or has failed to comply with Section 10262, or has failed in any other respect to prosecute the work with the diligence and force specified by the contract, the director may:

(a) After written notice of at least five days to the contractor, specifying the defaults to be remedied, provide any such labor or materials and deduct the cost from any money due or to become due to the contractor under the contract; or 

(b) If he considers that the failure is sufficient ground for such action, he may give written notice of at least five days to the contractor and the contractor’s sureties, that if the defaults are not remedied the contractor’s control over the work will be terminated.



######### 10254.  
If the defaults are not remedied within the time specified in the notice, the contractor’s control shall terminate as of the expiration of that time.



######### 10255.  
Upon such termination, the director may take possession of and use all or any part of the contractor’s materials, tools, equipment, and appliances upon the premises to complete the contract. Thereupon, he may permit the surety to complete or cause the contract work to be completed, or he may direct that all or any part of the work be completed by day’s labor or by employment of other contractors on informal contracts, or both.



######### 10256.  
Such informal contracts may be awarded only after a proposal form has been prepared, a copy is served upon the contractor whose control has been terminated, and upon his surety, and three days allowed thereafter so that he may cause others to bid. Any person who is prequalified therefor under Article 4 may bid on informal contracts.



######### 10257.  
The provisions of this part, except as to prequalification, are not applicable to the award of informal contracts.



######### 10258.  
If the control of a contractor is terminated or he abandons the work, and the work is performed by day’s labor or informal contract as provided in Section 10255, he is not entitled to receive any portion of the amount to be paid under the contract until it is fully completed. After completion, if the unpaid balance exceeds the sum of the amount expended by the state in finishing the work, plus all damages sustained or to be sustained by the state, the excess not otherwise required by law to be retained shall be paid to the contractor, but if such sum exceeds the unpaid balance, the contractor and his surety are liable to the state for the excess. If the surety completes the contract work, as provided in Section 10255, such surety shall be subrogated to money due under the contract and to money which shall become due in the course of completion by the surety, to the extent provided by law.



######### 10259.  
On the completion of the contract, the original contractor is entitled to the return of all his unused materials, and his equipment, tools, and appliances, except that he shall have no claim on account of usual and ordinary depreciation, loss, and wear and tear.



######### 10260.  
The notices required by this article may be served on the contractor or on his agent having charge of the work, personally, or by registered mail addressed to the contractor or his agent, or, if neither can be located or their addresses are unknown, by posting in a conspicuous place upon the premises of the project.



######### 10261.  
(a) Payments upon contracts shall be made as the department prescribes upon estimates made and approved by the department, but progress payments shall not be made in excess of 100 percent of the percentage of actual work completed plus a like percentage of the value of material delivered on the ground or stored subject to or under the control of the state, and unused, except as otherwise provided in this section. The department shall withhold not more than 5 percent of the contract price until final completion and acceptance of the project. However, at any time after 95 percent of the work has been completed, the department may reduce the funds withheld to an amount not less than 125 percent of the estimated value of the work yet to be completed, as determined by the department, if the reduction has been approved, in writing, by the surety on the performance bond and by the surety on the payment bond. The Controller shall draw their warrants upon estimates so made and approved by the department and the Treasurer shall pay them. The funds may be released by electronic transfer if that procedure is requested by the contractor, in writing, and if the department has, in place at the time of the request, the mechanism for the transfer.

(b) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), when the director of the department has made a finding prior to the bid that a specified project is substantially complex and therefore requires a higher retention amount than 5 percent, and the department includes in the bid documents details explaining the basis for the finding and the actual retention amount, then payments upon contracts by the department shall be made as the department prescribes upon estimates made and approved by the department. However, progress payments shall not be made in excess of 95 percent of the percentage of actual work completed, plus a like percentage of the value of material delivered on the ground or stored, subject to, or under the control of the state, and unused, except as otherwise provided in this section. At any time after 95 percent of the work has been completed, the department may reduce the funds withheld to an amount not less than 125 percent of the estimated value of the work yet to be completed, as determined by the department, if the reduction has been approved, in writing, by the surety on the performance bond and by the surety on the payment bond. The Controller shall draw their warrants upon estimates so made and approved by the department and the Treasurer shall pay them with funds appropriated therefor. The funds may be released by electronic transfer if that procedure is requested by the contractor, in writing, and if the department has, in place at the time of the request, the mechanism for the transfer.

(2) Any finding by the director of a department that a project is substantially complex shall include a description of the specific project and why it is a unique project that is not regularly, customarily, or routinely performed by the agency or licensed contractors.



######### 10261.5.  
(a) Any state agency which fails to make any progress payment within 30 days after receipt of the payment request from a contractor on a construction contract for an undisputed payment request, which was properly submitted by the contractor to the agency, shall pay interest to the contractor equivalent to the legal rate set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 685.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Any state agency which independently calculates the amount due on a progress payment and which fails to make a progress payment within 30 days of the first submittal of the estimate for each contract by the engineer, shall pay interest to the contractor equivalent to the legal rate set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 685.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In the event that the payment is not made within 30 days of receipt of the contractor’s request or the first submittal by the engineer, and the Controller has processed the payment within 14 days of receipt of the request or submittal, the contracting state agency shall pay interest to the contractor equivalent to the legal rate set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 685.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In the event that the payment is not made within 30 days of receipt of the contractor’s request or the first submittal by the engineer, and the contracting state agency has processed the payment within 16 days after receipt of the request or submittal, the Controller shall pay interest as provided in Section 685.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

For purposes of this section, a payment request shall be considered properly executed if funds are available for payment of the payment request, and payment is not delayed due to an audit inquiry by the Controller.

(b) Upon receipt of a payment request, each agency shall require:

(1) That each payment request be reviewed as soon as practicable after receipt for the purpose of determining that a payment request is a proper payment request.

(2) Any payment request determined not to be a proper payment request suitable for payment shall be returned as soon as practicable, but not later than seven days, after receipt, specifying the reasons that the payment request is not a proper payment request.

(3) The number of days available to a state agency to make a timely payment of payment request without incurring interest shall be reduced by the number of days by which an agency exceeds the requirements of paragraph (2).



######### 10261.7.  
(a) Within 10 days of making a construction contract payment, a state agency that maintains an Internet Web site shall post on its Internet Web site the following:

(1) The project for which the payment was made.

(2) The name of the construction contractor or company paid.

(3) The date the payment was made or the date the state agency transmitted instructions to the Controller or other payer to make the payment.

(4) The payment application number or other identifying information.

(5) The amount of the payment.

(b) This section shall not apply to a construction contract valued below twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).

(c) This section shall not apply to progress payments published under Section 10262.3.



######### 10262.  
The contractor shall pay to his or her subcontractors, within seven days of receipt of each progress payment, the respective amounts allowed the contractor on account of the work performed by his or her subcontractors, to the extent of each subcontractor’s interest therein. The payments to subcontractors shall be based on estimates made pursuant to Section 10261. Any diversion by the contractor of payments received for prosecution of a contract, or failure to reasonably account for the application or use of the payments constitutes ground for actions prescribed in Section 10253, in addition to disciplinary action by the Contractors’ State License Board. The subcontractor shall notify, in writing, the Contractors’ State License Board and the department of any payment less than the amount or percentage approved for the class or item of work as set forth in Section 10261.



######### 10262.3.  
To facilitate enforcement of Section 10262, the Department of General Services shall publish in the California State Contracts Register notice of progress payments made to prime contractors.



######### 10262.5.  
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, a prime contractor or subcontractor shall pay to any subcontractor, not later than seven days after receipt of each progress payment, the respective amounts allowed the contractor on account of the work performed by the subcontractors, to the extent of each subcontractor’s interest therein. In the event that there is a good faith dispute over all or any portion of the amount due on a progress payment from the prime contractor or subcontractor to a subcontractor, then the prime contractor or subcontractor may withhold no more than 150 percent of the disputed amount.

Any contractor who violates this section shall pay to the subcontractor a penalty of 2 percent of the amount due per month for every month that payment is not made. In any action for the collection of funds wrongfully withheld, the prevailing party shall be entitled to his or her attorney’s fees and costs.

(b) This section shall not be construed to limit or impair any contractual, administrative, or judicial remedies otherwise available to a contractor or a subcontractor in the event of a dispute involving late payment or nonpayment by a contractor or deficient subcontract performance or nonperformance by a subcontractor.

(c) On or before September 1 of each year, the head of each state agency shall submit to the Legislature a report on the number and dollar volume of written complaints received from subcontractors and prime contractors on contracts in excess of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000), relating to violations of this section.



######### 10263.  
(a) Provisions shall be included in any invitation for bid and in any contract documents to permit the substitution of securities for any moneys withheld by a public agency to ensure performance under a contract. At the request and expense of the contractor, securities equivalent to the amount withheld shall be deposited with the State Treasurer or, a state or federally chartered bank in this state, as the escrow agent, who shall then pay the moneys to the contractor. Upon satisfactory completion of the contract, the securities shall be returned to the contractor.

(b) Alternatively, the contractor may request and the owner shall make payment of retentions earned directly to the escrow agent. The contractor may direct the investment of the payments into securities and the contractor shall receive the interest earned on the investments upon the same terms provided for in this section for securities deposited by the contractor. Upon satisfactory completion of the contract, the contractor shall receive from the escrow agent all securities, interest, and payments received by the escrow agent from the owner, pursuant to the terms of this section.

(c) Alternatively, and subject to the approval and at the sole discretion of the public agency, the payment of retentions earned may be deposited directly with a person licensed under Division 6 (commencing with Section 17000) of the Financial Code as the escrow agent. Upon written request of an escrow agent who has not been approved by the public agency under this subdivision, the public agency shall provide written notice to that escrow agent within 10 business days of receipt of the request indicating the reason or reasons for not approving that escrow agent. An escrow agent that has been disapproved by the public agency may not maintain any cause of action of any nature against the state or any public agency, officer, agent, or employee of any public agency, in connection with the disapproval of that escrow agent. The payments shall be deposited in a trust account with a federally chartered bank or savings association within 24 hours of receipt by the escrow agent. The contractor shall not place any retentions with the escrow agent in excess of the coverage provided to that escrow agent pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 17314 of the Financial Code. In all respects not inconsistent with this subdivision, the remaining provisions of this section shall apply to escrow agents acting pursuant to this subdivision. In addition, an escrow agent subject to this subdivision shall maintain insurance to cover negligent acts and omissions of the escrow agent in connection with the handling of retentions under this section in an amount not less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) per contract, executed by an admitted insurer and in a form satisfactory to the public agency.

(d) Securities eligible for investment under this section shall include those listed in Section 16430 of the Government Code, bank or savings and loan certificates of deposit, interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, standby letters of credit, or any other security mutually agreed to by the contractor and the public agency.

The contractor shall be the beneficial owner of any securities substituted for moneys withheld and shall receive any interest thereon.

Failure to include the provisions prescribed by this section in bid and contract documents shall void any provisions for performance retentions in a public agency contract.

(e) (1) Any contractor who elects to receive interest on moneys withheld in retention by a public agency shall, at the request of any subcontractor, make that option available to the subcontractor regarding any moneys withheld in retention by the contractor from the subcontractor. If the contractor elects to receive interest on any moneys withheld in retention by a public agency, then the subcontractor shall receive the identical rate of interest received by the contractor on any retention moneys withheld from the subcontractor by the contractor, less any actual pro rata costs associated with administering and calculating that interest. In the event that the interest rate is a fluctuating rate, the rate for the subcontractor shall be determined by calculating the interest rate paid during the time that retentions were withheld from the subcontractor. If the contractor elects to substitute securities in lieu of retention, then, by mutual consent of the contractor and subcontractor, the subcontractor may substitute securities in exchange for the release of moneys held in retention by the contractor.

(2) This subdivision shall apply only to those subcontractors performing more than 5 percent of the contractor’s total bid.

(3) A contractor shall not require any subcontractor to waive any provision of this section.

(f) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the provisions of this section are of statewide concern and are necessary to encourage full participation by contractors and subcontractors in public contract procedures.

(g) An escrow agreement used pursuant to this section shall be null, void, and unenforceable unless it is substantially similar to the following form:


|
ESCROW AGREEMENT FOR SECURITY DEPOSITS IN LIEU OF RETENTION
|
||
|
This Escrow Agreement is made and entered into by and be­tween
|
|

|
whose address is hereinafter called “owner,” whose address is hereinafter called “contractor,” and whose address is hereinafter called “escrow agent.”
|
For the consideration hereinafter set forth, the owner, contractor, and escrow agent agree as follows:

(1) Pursuant to Section 10263 of the Public Contract Code of the State of California, the contractor has the option to deposit securities with the escrow agent as a substitute for retention earnings required to be withheld by the owner pursuant to the construction contract entered into between the owner and contractor for ____ in the amount of ____ dated ____ (hereafter referred to as the “contract”). Alternatively, on written request of the contractor, the owner shall make payments of the retention earnings directly to the escrow agent. When the contractor deposits the securities as a substitute for the contract earnings, the escrow agent shall notify the owner within 10 days of the deposit. The market value of the securities at the time of the substitution shall be at least equal to the cash amount then required to be withheld as retention under the terms of the contract between the owner and contractor. Securities shall be held in the name of the ____, and shall designate the contractor as the beneficial owner.

(2) The owner shall make progress payments to the contractor for those funds which otherwise would be withheld from progress payments pursuant to the contract provision, provided that the escrow agent holds securities in the form and amount specified above.

(3) When the owner makes payment of retentions earned directly to the escrow agent, the escrow agent shall hold them for the benefit of the contractor until such time as the escrow created under this contract is terminated. The contractor may direct the investment of the payments into securities. All terms and conditions of this agreement and the rights and responsibilities of the parties shall be equally applicable and binding when the owner pays the escrow agent directly.

(4) The contractor shall be responsible for paying all fees for the expenses incurred by the escrow agent in administering the escrow account. These expenses and payment terms shall be determined by the contractor and escrow agent.

(5) The interest earned on the securities or the money market accounts held in escrow and all interest earned on the interest shall be for the sole account of contractor and shall be subject to withdrawal by contractor at any time and from time to time without notice to the owner.

(6) The contractor shall have the right to withdraw all or any part of the principal in the escrow account only by written notice to the escrow agent accompanied by written authorization from the owner to the escrow agent that the owner consents to the withdrawal of the amount sought to be withdrawn by contractor.

(7) The owner shall have a right to draw upon the securities in the event of default by the contractor. Upon seven days’ written notice to the escrow agent from the owner of the default, the escrow agent shall immediately convert the securities to cash and shall distribute the cash as instructed by the owner.

(8) Upon receipt of written notification from the owner certifying that the contract is final and complete, and that the contractor has complied with all requirements and procedures applicable to the contract, the escrow agent shall release to the contractor all securities and interest on deposit less escrow fees and charges of the escrow account. The escrow shall be closed immediately upon disbursement of all moneys and securities on deposit and payments of fees and charges.

(9) The escrow agent shall rely on the written notifications from the owner and the contractor pursuant to Sections (1) to (8), inclusive, of this agreement and the owner and contractor shall hold the escrow agent harmless from the escrow agent’s release, conversion, and disbursement of the securities and interest as set forth above.

(10) The names of the persons who are authorized to give written notice or to receive written notice on behalf of the owner and on behalf of the contractor in connection with the foregoing, and exemplars of their respective signatures are as follows:

The board shall delegate the review of such a contract to the executive officer of the board.  If the employee organization requests it, the executive officer shall grant the employee organization the opportunity to present its case against the contract and the reasons why the contract should be referred to the board for a hearing. Upon a showing of good cause by the employee organization, the executive officer shall schedule the disputed contract for a hearing before the board for the purpose of receiving evidence and hearing arguments concerning the propriety of the disputed contract.

The trustees may carry out work in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000) under this section by day labor if the trustees deem that the award of a contract, the acceptance of bids, or the acceptance of further bids is not in the best interests of the state, but the amount of work performed by day labor under this section shall not exceed the sum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000).



######### 10706.  
The trustees and the Department of General Services may enter into an agreement under which the Department of General Services will carry out any of the functions of the trustees under this chapter, upon such terms as are mutually agreed upon.



######### 10706.5.  
The trustees may enter into an agreement with an auxiliary organization, as defined in Section 89901 of the Education Code, under which the auxiliary organization may carry out any of the functions of the trustees under this chapter, upon terms that are mutually agreed upon.



######### 10707.  
The trustees may enter into service contracts. Such contracts shall be subject only to Section 10820 and to such other provisions of this chapter, if any, as the trustees may from time to time designate as applicable.



######### 10708.  
(a) When, in the opinion of the trustees, the best interests of the California State University dictate, the trustees may enter into an agreement with a contractor to provide all or significant portions of the design services and construction of a project under this chapter. The contractor shall design the project pursuant to the scope of services set forth in the request for proposals, build the project, and present the completed project to the trustees for their approval and acceptance.

(b) Work under this section shall be carried out by a contractor chosen by a competitive bidding process that employs selection criteria in addition to cost. Any design work performed pursuant to this section shall be prepared and signed by an architect certificated pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 5500) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code.

(c) When the design of portions of the project permits the selection of subcontractors, the contractor shall competitively bid those portions. The contractor shall provide to the trustees a list of subcontractors whose work is in excess of one-half of 1 percent of the total project cost as soon as the subcontractors are identified. Once listed, the subcontractors shall have the rights provided in the Subletting and Subcontracting Fair Practices Act (Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 4100) of Part 1).



######### 10709.  
Notwithstanding any provision of the California State University Contract Law and any other provision of law to the contrary, the trustees may enter into an energy conservation construction contract, on the terms it determines are in the best interests of the California State University if they find that the anticipated cost for the alterations effected by the energy conservation construction contract will be less than the anticipated marginal cost to the California State University of energy that would have been consumed by the California State University in the absence of those alterations.  The letting of contracts pursuant to this section shall be conducted through competitive means.



######### 10710.  
(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the trustees may award annual contracts that do not exceed three million dollars ($3,000,000) for repair or other repetitive work, or renovation or modification, to be done according to unit prices.  The contracts shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, and shall be based primarily on plans and specifications for typical work.  No project shall be performed under a contract of this type except by order of the trustees.  No annual contracts may be awarded under these provisions for capital outlay projects, where the total cost of the project exceeds the value of a minor capital outlay project for which, pursuant to Section 10108, the services of the Department of General Services are not required and a state agency or department is authorized to carry out its own project.

(b) For purposes of this section, “unit price” means the amount paid for a single unit of an item of work, and “typical work” means a work description applicable universally or applicable to a large number of individual projects, as distinguished from work specifically described with respect to an individual project.









##### ARTICLE 2. Plans and Specifications [10720 - 10726]  

######### 10720.  
Before entering into any contract for a project, the trustees, pursuant to the powers invested in them by Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 66600) of Part 40 of Division 5 of Title 3 of the Education Code, shall cause to be prepared full, complete, and accurate plans and specifications and estimates of cost, giving such directions as will enable any competent mechanic or other builder to carry them out.



######### 10721.  
The plans, specifications, and estimates of cost shall be approved by the trustees, and the original draft or a certified copy filed permanently in the office of the trustees before further action is taken.



######### 10722.  
Work on all projects shall be done under contract awarded to the lowest responsible bidder pursuant to this chapter, except that it may be done by day’s labor under the direction of the trustees, by contract upon informal bids, or by a combination thereof:

(a)  When the trustees determine that an emergency exists due to an act of God, earthquake, flood, storm, fire, landslide, public disturbance, vandalism, or other unexpected cause which results in damage to a state-owned building, state-owned real property, or any improvements thereon, for work and remedial measures which are required immediately and which are necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

The trustees shall annually, on or before December 31, report to the Department of Finance and the Joint Legislative Budget Committee the instances in which an exemption from the bidding process was allowed due to “unexpected causes.”   

(b) At any time after the approval of plans, specifications, and estimates of cost, if the trustees deem the advertising or award of a contract, the acceptance of any bid, or the acceptance of any further bids after the rejection of all submitted bids, is not in the best interests of the state.



######### 10723.  
Upon the approval of the trustees the authorized employees of the trustees may, when proceeding upon the basis of day’s labor, let any subdivision or unit of the work by contract upon informal bids; but such work shall be let only to a holder of a valid state contractor’s license unless such work is exempt from such licensing requirement by any other provision of law.



######### 10724.  
Bids may be received and contracts awarded on a unit basis, that is, the bids compared upon the basis of estimates of the quantities of the work to be done.



######### 10725.  
Except in unit basis contracts, contracts shall not be made exceeding in amount the estimates of costs approved by the trustees. Plans and specifications and estimates of costs, including expense of advertising and inspection, shall not be approved by the trustees requiring a greater expenditure of money than is appropriated for the specific purpose in the law authorizing the expenditure.



######### 10726.  
The trustees may receive bids for the construction of several public works projects at the California State University as a single project. Where more than one appropriation has been made for the several projects united as a single project under the provisions of this section, payments for the single project shall be made from the separate appropriations on such proportional basis as may be determined by the trustees and approved by the Department of Finance.









##### ARTICLE 3. Advertisement for Bids [10740 - 10743]  

######### 10740.  
When it appears from the estimates of cost that the estimated contract price of any project will not exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), the trustees may direct that public notice to bidders be given as follows:

(a) By publication for two consecutive insertions in a weekly trade paper of general circulation, published either in Los Angeles or San Francisco, devoted primarily to the dissemination of contract news among contracting firms; and

(b) Once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the project is located, or, if located in more than one county in such a newspaper in a county in which a major portion of the work is to be done.



######### 10741.  
The notices shall state the time and place for the receiving and opening of sealed bids and describe in general terms the work to be done.



######### 10742.  
If it appears that the estimated contract price will exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), public notice to bidders shall be given by publication once a week for at least two consecutive weeks, or once a week for more than two consecutive weeks if such longer period of advertising is deemed necessary by the trustees, next preceding the day set for the receiving of bids:

(a) In two trade papers of general circulation, one published in Los Angeles and one in San Francisco, devoted primarily to the dissemination of contract and building news among contracting and building material supply firms; or

(b) In one newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the major portion of the project is located, and in one such trade paper published in the county group, as defined in Section 187 of the Streets and Highways Code, in which the work is to be done; or

(c) Electronically on the California State University’s Internet Web site.



######### 10743.  
The notices shall state the time and place for the receiving and opening of sealed bids and that the bids will be required for the entire project and for the performance of segregate designated parts of the entire project, when the trustees determine that segregation is advisable.









##### ARTICLE 4. Bids and Bidders [10760 - 10767]  

######### 10760.  
The trustees may require, and on contracts the estimated cost of which exceeds the value of a minor capital outlay project for which, pursuant to the first paragraph of Section 10108, the services of the Department of General Services are not required and a state agency or department is authorized to carry out its own project, the trustees shall require, from prospective bidders, answers to questions contained in a standard form of questionnaire and financial statement including a complete statement of the prospective bidder’s financial ability and experience in performing public works projects.  When completed, the questionnaire and financial statement shall be verified under oath by the bidder in the manner in which pleadings in civil actions are verified.



######### 10761.  
The trustees shall adopt and apply a uniform system of rating bidders, on the basis of the standard questionnaires and financial statements, in respect to the size of the contracts upon which each bidder is qualified to bid.



######### 10762.  
In all projects for road, street, and bridge work where federal funds are involved and where a bidder is required to be and has been prequalified pursuant to Sections 10760 and 10761, no bid submitted or contract thereafter awarded shall be invalidated by the failure of the bidder or contractor to be properly licensed in accordance with the laws of this state, nor shall any such contractor be denied payment under any such contract because of such failure; provided, however, that the first payment for work or material under such contract shall not be made by the Controller unless and until the Registrar of Contractors certifies to him that the records of the Contractors’ State License Board indicate that such contractor was or became properly licensed between the time of bid opening and the making of the certification. Any bidder or contractor not so licensed shall be subject to all legal penalties imposed by such laws, including, but not limited to, any appropriate disciplinary action by the Contractors’ State License Board, and the trustees shall include a statement to that effect in the standard form of prequalification questionnaire and financial statement.



######### 10763.  
The questionnaires and financial statements are not public records and are not open to public inspection.



######### 10764.  
The trustees shall furnish to each bidder a standard proposal form, which, when filled out and executed, may be submitted as the bid. Bids not presented on forms so furnished shall be disregarded. The trustees shall not furnish proposal forms to any person who is required to submit and has not submitted a questionnaire and financial statement for prequalification at least five days prior to the date fixed for publicly opening sealed bids and been prequalified for at least one day prior to that date.



######### 10765.  
(a) All bids shall be presented under sealed cover and accompanied by one of the following forms of bidder’s security: cash, a cashier’s check, certified check, or a bidder’s bond executed by an admitted surety insurer, made payable to the trustees. The security shall be in an amount equal to at least 10 percent of the amount bid. A bid shall not be considered unless one of the forms of bidder’s security is enclosed with it.

(b) A bid described in subdivision (a) may be submitted electronically in accordance with Section 1601, but only if the bidder submits the bidder’s security required by subdivision (a) within 24 hours after the opening of bids.



######### 10766.  
Whether or not bids are opened exactly at the time fixed in the public notice for opening bids, a bid shall not be received after that time.



######### 10767.  
Any bid may be withdrawn at any time prior to the time fixed in the public notice for the opening of bids only by written request for the withdrawal of the bid filed with the trustees. The request shall be executed by the bidder or his or her duly authorized representative. The withdrawal of a bid does not prejudice the right of the bidder to file a new bid.

This section does not authorize the withdrawal of any bid after the time fixed in the public notice for the opening of bids.









##### ARTICLE 5. Award of Contracts [10780 - 10785]  

######### 10780.  
On the day named in the public notice the trustees shall publicly open the sealed bids and award the contracts to the lowest responsible bidders.



######### 10780.5.  
The trustees may require a bid for a public works contract to include prices for items that may be added to, or deducted from, the scope of work in the contract for which the bid is being submitted.  Whenever additive or deductive items are included in a bid, the bid solicitation shall specify which one of the following methods will be used to determine the lowest bid. In the absence of such a specification, only the method provided by subdivision (a) will be used:

(a) The lowest bid shall be the lowest bid price on the base contract without consideration of the prices on the additive or deductive items.

(b) The lowest bid shall be the lowest total of the bid prices on the base contract and those additive or deductive items that were specifically identified in the bid solicitation as being used for the purpose of determining the lowest bid price.

(c) The lowest bid shall be the lowest total of the bid prices on the base contract and those additive or deductive items that, when taken in order from a specifically identified list of those items in the solicitation, and added to, or subtracted from, the base contract, are less than, or equal to, a funding amount publicly disclosed by the trustees before the first bid is opened.

(d) The lowest bid shall be determined in a manner that prevents any information that would identify any of the bidders or proposed subcontractors or suppliers from being revealed to the public entity before the ranking of all bidders from lowest to highest has been determined.

A responsible bidder who submitted the lowest bid as determined by this section shall be awarded the contract, if it is awarded.  This section does not preclude the trustees from adding to or deducting from the contract any of the additive or deductive items after the lowest responsible bidder has been determined.

(e) Nothing in this section shall preclude the prequalification of subcontractors.



######### 10781.  
If the successful bidder fails to execute the contract, the bidder’s security shall be forfeited to the state. The cash or proceeds shall be deposited in the fund out of which the expenses of preparation and printing of the plans and specifications, estimates of cost, and publication of notice are paid.



######### 10782.  
If the trustees deem it is for the best interest of the state, they may, on the refusal or failure of the successful bidder to execute the contract, award it to the second lowest responsible bidder.

If the second lowest responsible bidder fails or refuses to execute the contract, the trustees may likewise award it to the third lowest responsible bidder.   

On the failure or refusal of the second or third lowest bidder, to whom a contract is so awarded, to execute it, the bidder’s security shall be likewise forfeited to the state.



######### 10783.  
The failure of the successful bidder to furnish any bond required by law, within the time fixed for execution of the contract, constitutes a failure to execute the contract.



######### 10784.  
The bidder’s security of the second and third lowest responsible bidders may be withheld until the contract has been finally executed. The cash, cashier’s checks, and certified checks submitted by all other unsuccessful bidders shall be returned to them within 10 days after the contract is awarded, and their bidders’ bonds shall be of no further effect.



######### 10785.  
If the trustees deem the acceptance of the lowest responsible bid or bids is not for the best interests of the state, they may reject all bids and proceed by day’s labor or advertise for other bids in the manner required by this chapter.









##### ARTICLE 7. Contract Requirements [10820 - 10828]  

######### 10820.  
Every contract awarded under this chapter shall be submitted to the Attorney General or the attorney appointed according to law and authorized to represent the trustees. Such a contract is not binding on the state until the appropriate attorney finds it to be in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, and endorses such finding thereon.

A certified copy of each contract shall be filed with the Controller, but the failure to so file does not invalidate it.



######### 10821.  
Every contract shall provide for the filing of separate performance and payment bonds by the contractor executed by an admitted surety insurer, subject to the approval of the trustees.



######### 10822.  
Each bond shall be in a sum equal to at least one-half of the contract price, except as otherwise provided in Section 9554 of the Civil Code.



######### 10823.  
The payment bond shall secure the payment of the claims of laborers, mechanics, or materialmen employed on the work under the contract and shall contain all other provisions required by law.



######### 10824.  
The performance bond shall guarantee the faithful performance of the contract by the contractor.



######### 10825.  
No payment shall be made upon the contract to the contractor or any assignee of the contractor until an order by the trustees that a sufficient surety be substituted on the bond, or that a new, additional, or supplemental bond be given, is satisfied.



######### 10826.  
Every contract shall contain a provision in regard to the time when the whole or any specified portion of the work contemplated shall be completed, and shall provide that for each day completion is delayed beyond the specified time, the contractor shall forfeit and pay to the state a specified sum of money, to be deducted from any payments due or to become due to the contractor. The sum so specified is valid as liquidated damages unless manifestly unreasonable under the circumstances existing at the time the contract was made. A contract for a road project may also provide for the payment of extra compensation to the contractor, as a bonus for completion prior to the specified time, such provision, if used, to be included in the specifications and to clearly set forth the basis for such payment.



######### 10827.  
Every contract shall provide that the trustees may make changes in the plans and specifications pursuant to this chapter.



######### 10828.  
Notwithstanding any other law, commencing January 1, 2024, the California State University shall not approve a health benefit plan contract for employees that does not comply with the contraceptive coverage requirements of Sections 1367.25 and 1367.255 of the Health and Safety Code, and Sections 10123.1945 and 10123.196 of the Insurance Code.

No officer or employee in the California State University shall contract on his or her own individual behalf as an independent contractor with any California State University department to provide services or goods.  This section shall not apply to officers or employees of the California State University with teaching or research responsibilities.



######### 10832.  
(a) No retired, dismissed, separated, or formerly employed person of the California State University employed with the California State University or otherwise appointed to serve in the California State University may enter into a contract in which he or she engaged in any of the negotiations, transactions, planning, arrangements, or any part of the decisionmaking process relevant to the contract while employed in any capacity by any California State University department.  The prohibition of this subdivision shall apply to a person only during the two-year period beginning on the date the person left California State University employment.

(b) For a period of 12 months following the date of his or her retirement, dismissal, or separation from the California State University, no person employed in the California State University or otherwise appointed to serve in the California State University may enter into a contract with any California State University department, if he or she was employed by that department in a policymaking position in the same general subject area as the proposed contract within the 12-month period prior to his or her retirement, dismissal, or separation.  The prohibition of this subdivision shall not apply to a contract requiring the person’s services as an expert witness in a civil case or to a contract for the continuation of an attorney’s services on a matter he or she was involved with prior to leaving the California State University.

(c) This section does not prohibit the rehire or reappointment of California State University employees after retirement, consistent with California State University administrative policies, nor does it apply to inventors and authors of intellectual property licensed under technology transfer agreements.



######### 10833.  
(a) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b), each contractor who enters into a contract with a California State University campus for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or more shall be assigned an identification number by the president of that California State University campus.  Each contractor who has been assigned a number shall list it on each contract the contractor enters into with the California State University campus, regardless of the amount of the contract.  In the case of a corporation or firm, the president’s assigned number shall be used exclusively on each contract with that president’s campus.  The assigned number shall remain unchanged regardless of future name changes.

(b) If the identification numbers cannot be tracked centrally by the Trustees of the California State University, then the trustees, and not the presidents, shall assign the identification numbers.









##### ARTICLE 8. Modifications; Performance; Payment [10840 - 10853]  

######### 10840.  
The trustees may increase or decrease quantities of work to be done under a unit basis contract during the progress of the work.



######### 10841.  
The trustees may cause the insertion of provisions in any contract for the performance of such extra work and the furnishing of materials therefor by the contractor as the trustees require for the proper completion or construction of the whole work contemplated, if the bidders have equal opportunity of knowing the proposed terms for the extra work.



######### 10842.  
The trustees may grant such extensions of time for completion as they deem for the best interests of the state.



######### 10843.  
If the trustees deem that a contractor has failed to supply an adequate working force, or material of proper quality, or has failed in any other respect to prosecute the work with the diligence and force specified by the contract, the trustees may:

(a) After written notice of at least five days to the contractor, specifying the defaults to be remedied, provide any such labor or materials and deduct the cost from any money due or to become due to the contractor under the contract; or 

(b) If the trustees consider that the failure is sufficient ground for such action, they may give written notice of at least five days to the contractor and the contractor’s sureties, that if the defaults are not remedied the contractor’s control over the work will be terminated.



######### 10844.  
If the defaults are not remedied within the time specified in the notice, the contractor’s control shall terminate as of the expiration of that time.



######### 10845.  
Upon such termination, the trustees may take possession of and use all or any part of the contractor’s materials, tools, equipment, and appliances upon the premises to complete the contract. Thereupon, the trustees may permit the surety to complete or cause the contract work to be completed, or they may direct that all or any part of the work be completed by day’s labor or by employment of other contractors on informal contracts, or both.



######### 10846.  
Such informal contracts may be awarded only after a proposal form has been prepared, a copy is served upon the contractor whose control has been terminated, and upon his or her surety, and three days allowed thereafter so that he or she may cause others to bid. Any person who is prequalified therefor under Article 4 (commencing with Section 10760) of this chapter may bid on informal contracts.



######### 10847.  
The provisions of this chapter, except as to prequalifications, are not applicable to the award of informal contracts.



######### 10848.  
If the control of a contractor is terminated or he or she abandons the work, and the work is performed by day’s labor or informal contract as provided in Section 10845, he or she is not entitled to receive any portion of the amount to be paid under the contract until it is fully completed. After completion, if the unpaid balance exceeds the sum of the amount expended by the state in finishing the work, plus all damages sustained or to be sustained by the state, the excess not otherwise required by law to be retained shall be paid to the contractor, but if such sum exceeds the unpaid balance, the contractor and his or her surety are liable to the state for the excess. If the surety completes the contract work, as provided in Section 10845, such surety shall be subrogated to money due under the contract and to money which shall become due in the course of completion by the surety, to the extent provided by law.



######### 10849.  
On the completion of the contract, the original contractor is entitled to the return of all his or her unused materials, and his or her equipment, tools, and appliances, except that he or she shall have no claim on account of usual and ordinary depreciation, loss, and wear and tear.



######### 10850.  
The notices required by this article may be served on the contractor or on his or her agent having charge of the work, personally, or by registered mail addressed to the contractor or his or her agent, or, if neither can be located or their addresses are unknown, by posting in a conspicuous place upon the premises of the project.



######### 10851.  
Payments upon contracts shall be made as the trustees prescribe upon estimates made and approved by the trustees, but progress payments shall not be made in excess of 95 percent of the percentage of actual work completed plus a like percentage of the value of material delivered on the ground or stored subject to or under the control of the state, and unused. The trustees shall withhold not less than 5 percent of the contract price until final completion and acceptance of the project. The Controller shall draw warrants upon estimates so made and approved by the trustees and the Treasurer shall pay them.



######### 10852.  
At the request and expense of the contractor, and with the approval of the trustees, any amount withheld pursuant to Section 10851 may be deposited with the Treasurer as the escrow agent, who shall pay such moneys to the contractor upon the placing of securities eligible for the investment of state funds under Section 16430 of the Government Code or bank certificates of deposit into such escrow account by the contractor.

“Approval of the trustees,” as used in this section, means that the trustees may, in their discretion, allow or deny the request of the contractor to avail itself of the provisions of this section and that the trustees may, in their discretion, allow the request of the contractor upon the satisfaction of conditions which may be specified by the trustees.

The contractor shall be beneficial owner of any securities in an escrow account pursuant to this section and shall receive any interest thereon.

Any escrow agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall contain as a minimum, the following provisions:

(a) The amount of securities to be deposited; such amount shall not be less than the amount which would otherwise be withheld pursuant to Section 10851;

(b) The terms and conditions of conversion to cash in case of the default of the contractor; and

(c) The termination of the escrow upon completion of the contract.



######### 10853.  
(a) If the trustees fail to make a progress payment on a contract within 39 days after receipt of an undisputed and properly submitted payment request from a contractor on a construction contract, the trustees shall pay interest to the contractor equivalent to the legal rate set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 685.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  If the payment is not made within 39 days of receipt of the contractor’s request, and the Controller has processed the payment within 14 days of the receipt of the request, the trustees shall pay interest to the contractor equivalent to the legal rate as provided in subdivision (a) of Section 685.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  If the payment is not made within 39 days of receipt of the contractor’s request, and the trustees have processed the payment within 25 days after the receipt of the request, the Controller shall pay interest equivalent to the legal rate as provided in subdivision (a) of Section 685.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

(b) Upon receipt of a payment request, the trustees shall act in accordance with the following:

(1) Each payment request shall be reviewed by the trustees as soon as practicable after receipt for the purpose of determining that the payment request is a proper payment request.

(2) Any payment request determined not to be a proper request suitable for payment shall be returned to the contractor as soon as practicable, but not later than seven days after receipt.  A request returned pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by a document setting forth in writing the reasons why the payment request is not proper.

(3) Upon request from the trustees, the Controller may elect to expedite each payment request and may charge the trustees an appropriate amount, as determined by the Controller, for costs incurred in expediting the payment request.

(c) The number of days available to the trustees to make a payment without incurring interest shall be reduced by the number of days by which the trustees exceed the seven-day return requirement set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b).

(d) A properly submitted payment request shall be defined as the date upon which the trustees receive a payment request, certified in accordance with the contract, at the address identified in the contract.

(e) For purposes of this section:

(1) A “progress payment” includes all payments due contractors, except that portion of the final payment withheld pursuant to Section 10851.

(2) A payment request shall be considered properly executed if funds are available for payment of the payment request and payment is not delayed due to an audit inquiry by the Controller.

It is the intent of the Legislature that policies and procedures developed by the Department of Technology and the Department of General Services in accordance with this chapter provide for the following:

(a) The expeditious and value-effective acquisition of information technology goods and services to satisfy state requirements.

(b) The acquisition of information technology goods and services within a competitive framework.

(c) The delegation of authority by the Department of General Services to each state agency that has demonstrated to the department’s satisfaction the ability to conduct value-effective information technology goods and services acquisitions.

(d) The exclusion from state bid processes, at the state’s option, of any supplier having failed to meet prior contractual requirements related to information technology goods and services.

(e) The review and resolution of protests submitted by any bidders with respect to any information technology goods and services acquisitions.



######### 12101.2.  
The Department of General Services shall prenegotiate the repetitively used terms and conditions in the state’s model contract with each interested vendor who bids or proposes on electronic data processing or telecommunications procurements. The contract language shall be kept on file, as a matter of public record, and shall remain operational until either the state or the vendor provides 30 days’ notice to the other party that new negotiations are deemed appropriate.

If, for a particular procurement, the state seeks to make any further changes to either the negotiated or the standard contract language, or both, it shall identify those changes to each bidder or proposer prior to the due date for the bid or proposal. If for a particular procurement, a bidder or proposer seeks to propose a negotiated change or standard contract language change, it shall make this identification within the timeframe identified in the solicitation document.



######### 12101.5.  
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature that agencies of the state use an acquisition method that is compatible with their short- and long-term fiscal needs in contracts relating to commodities and information technology goods and services. State agencies should be able to specify their anticipated life cycle requirements that would become one of the criteria for contractor selection. These agencies should be given the choice of suppliers to meet statewide standardization needs, unique service requirements, application requirements, and long-term satisfaction criteria. There is a need for the state to enter into long-term contracts with annual cancellation and fund-out clauses, as required, to protect the state’s interests as well as provide the option for multiyear renewals to encourage suppliers to develop higher levels of service and support throughout the contracts.

(b) The state may utilize multiple awards, including federal General Service Administration Multiple Awards Schedules and master agreements or contracts for goods, information technology, services, or consulting services. For purposes of this subdivision, a multiple award is an award of an indefinite quantity contract for one or more similar goods, information technology, or services to more than one supplier. Except for possible multiple awards as permitted by this subdivision, and except as described in subdivision (d), all the requirements of this chapter pertaining to other types of information technology acquisitions shall be followed. The Department of General Services shall administer this section and ensure that multiple award schedules are in compliance with all other applicable statutes.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, state agencies, in exercising their contracting authority delegated by the Department of General Services, may contract with suppliers who have multiple award schedules with the General Services Administration of the United States on the same terms, conditions, and prices if the supplier is willing to do so. The Department of General Services may also develop multiple award schedules or agreements for use by state agencies in the same manner. The Department of General Services shall determine the delegation contracting authority for agencies wishing to use multiple award schedules.

(d) For contracts related to information technology integration or development projects that generate revenues or achieve savings over a quantifiable baseline of existing costs, state agencies shall consider and may incorporate performance-based or share-in-savings contract terms to manage risks and create incentives for successful contract performance. Performance-based or share-in-savings contracts may have the following characteristics, among others:

(1) Contract terms that specify business outcomes to be achieved, not the solution to be provided.

(2) Contract terms that structure the contract to maintain maximum vendor commitment to project success and minimize risk to the state by sharing risk with the private sector.

(3) Utilization of “best value” evaluation methods, which means to select the solution that will achieve the best result based on business performance measures, not necessarily the lowest price.

(4) Contract terms that base payments to the vendor primarily on achieving predefined performance measures.



######### 12101.7.  
(a) Notwithstanding the sealed bidding provisions of this chapter, reverse auctions may be utilized for the acquisition of information technology, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 10290.3.

The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) It is the policy of the state to conserve and protect resources for future citizens as well as the current population of the state.

(b) It is in the best interest of the people of the state that the state alter its perception of solid waste to instead look upon this waste as resources that can be recovered and reused.

(c) It is in the best interest of reducing the increasing burden on communities disposing of the state’s solid waste for the state to take a role in developing an integrated state solid waste management policy, which includes source reduction, recycling, composting, market development, incineration, and landfills.  Since recycling is a necessary component of this policy, the state shall encourage the use of recycled products to ensure that the state’s industries have sufficient and adequate markets for products regeneratively utilizing the state’s solid waste as recycled resources.

(d) It is the policy of the state to encourage the expansion of businesses located in California and, to whatever extent possible, to look favorably on California businesses in the recycling industry, which include, but are not limited to, those California businesses that manufacture, distribute, or act as brokers for, recycled products.

(e) Market development is the key to moving beyond the uneven collection of recyclable materials to stable resource recovery and reuse.  Because of existing local collection programs, significant quantities of recycled resources such as the following are today available for purchase:  fine grades of paper, high-quality paper products, plastics, retreaded automobile tires, rerefined lubricating oil, reused automotive parts, reclaimed solvents, recycled asphalt, recycled concrete, carpet or geotextiles composed of recycled plastics, compost and co-compost products, and steel products.

(f) In making these findings, the Legislature declares that the policy and intent of this chapter is to set an example for the state and nation to encourage the purchase of products utilizing recycled resources.

(g) It is the intent of the Legislature, whenever economically feasible and as markets allow, to continually expand the policies of the state to utilize recycled resources in the daily operations of the state.  This includes, but is not limited to, the procurement and purchase of recycled materials, the use of recycled resources in the performance of a service or project for the state, and the purchase of equipment used for the collection and sale of waste materials generated by the state.

(h) It is the intent of the Legislature that the Department of General Services work with all state departments, agencies, the Legislature, the California Integrated Waste Management Board, and the Department of Conservation to draft, establish, and implement policies that ensure the procurement and use of recycled resources.

(i) It is also the intent of the Legislature to encourage local public agencies and private companies to adopt policies to maximize the use of recycled resources.



######### 12156.

(e) As used in this section, the following terms mean:

(1) “Printer or duplication cartridge” means a cartridge, including, but not limited to, a toner or ink cartridge, used in printer or duplication equipment for business or personal use.

(2) “Recycled” means a printer or duplication cartridge that would otherwise become solid waste, but which has undergone a process of collecting, sorting, cleansing, treating, or reconstituting, and which has been returned for the manufacture of new  products or the remanufacture of used cartridges.

(3) “Remanufactured” means a printer or duplication cartridge that has served its intended end use, but, rather than being discarded or disposed of, has instead been restored, renovated, repaired, or recharged, without substantial alteration of its form.

(b) The collection program for each product and each location shall be reevaluated by the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery on or before January 1, 1994. Subsequently, the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, upon the determination that inclusion of any particular material type would result in a net revenue loss to the state, shall have the discretion to exclude that material from the program, and shall report its conclusions and recommendations to the Legislature. In determining the net revenue loss for the collection of a specified waste material, the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery shall include the avoided cost to dispose of the waste material. The plan shall provide either for the collection and sale of materials to private brokers, recycling plants, or nonprofit organizations, or the operation of these entities by the state, or a combination thereof. The plan shall be implemented at the earliest possible date.

(c) The Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery shall provide participating locations with public awareness information and training to state and legislative employees, including, but not limited to, the proper separation and disposal of recyclable resources. Additionally, the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery shall provide training for personnel, including, but not limited to, state buildings and grounds personnel, responsible for the collection of waste materials. This training shall include, but is not limited to, educating and training the personnel concerning the separation and collection of recyclable materials.

The Legislature further finds and declares that it is in the public interest to provide special consideration for the state purchase of co-compost and compost products because these products substantially reduce the need for solid waste disposal facilities, such as landfills, and will assist the state in providing new alternatives for the alarming decrease in available solid waste disposal facilities, such as landfills.



######### 12183.  
(a) All state departments and agencies, including, but not limited to, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Water Resources, the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and the Department of Parks and Recreation, shall give purchase preference to compost and cocompost products when they can be substituted for, and cost no more than, the cost of regular fertilizer or soil amendment products, or both, if the cocompost products meet all applicable state standards and regulations, as determined by appropriate testing. The product preference shall include, but not be limited to, the construction of noise attenuation barriers and safety walls, highway planting projects, and recultivation and erosion control programs.



######### 12184.

##### CHAPTER 7. The Federal Laboratory Contracting Act [12500 - 12502]  

######### 12500.  
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Federal Laboratory Contracting Act.



######### 12501.  
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) Technological advances are an important part of California’s economy and, therefore, it would be wise for state agencies to contract, in a facile and efficient manner, with federally funded Department of Energy (DOE) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) research and development centers and NASA field centers located in California that are often at the forefront of science and technology.

(b) As the major funding agency and owner of several research and development centers located in California, DOE allows outside parties to contract with the centers but requires the centers, when initiating and finalizing any contracts with outside parties, to adhere to rigorous policies and procedures specified by federal laws and regulations. NASA adheres to similar federal laws and regulations when initiating and finalizing contracts between its research and development centers or field centers in California and outside parties. The State of California has its own laws, regulations, and procedures governing state contracts. The research and development centers and field centers owned or owned and operated by DOE and NASA have attempted to contract with state agencies and departments in California but have had minimal success. Conflicting provisions in federal and state laws, regulations, and policies, and seemingly unachievable compromises appear to be the major limiting factors in the successful negotiation of contracts between the federally funded centers and California state agencies and departments.



######### 12501.5.  
(a) The Governor shall designate the Secretary of State and Consumer Services as the state’s representative for purposes of communicating and negotiating with representatives of the United States Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, federally funded DOE and NASA research and development centers in California, and NASA field centers in California regarding any issue that may affect a contractual relationship between the state and these federal entities. The Secretary of State and Consumer Services may delegate this responsibility to the Director of the Department of General Services if the secretary views such delegation as necessary to advance the successful negotiation of contracts between the state and one or more of those federal entities.

(b) The Secretary of State and Consumer Services or his or her designee shall develop policies and procedures to encourage and enable the contracting process with federally funded DOE and NASA research and development centers and NASA field centers and shall develop model contract language that is available for use by any state agency or department in negotiating a contract with one of these centers. The Regents of the University of California shall not be considered a state agency for the purposes of this chapter, and specifically shall not be covered as prime contractor with the DOE for management of DOE laboratories.



######### 12502.  
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, a state agency that enters into a prime contract with a federally funded DOE or NASA research and development center or NASA field center, or that enters into a prime contract with another entity that, in turn, issues a subcontract to a federally funded DOE or NASA research and development center or a NASA field center located in California may, if requested by the contracting party, make contract payments to the center for contracted services in advance.

(b) Notwithstanding any other law, a state agency that enters into a prime contract with a federally funded DOE or NASA research and development center or NASA field center, or that enters into a prime contract with another entity that, in turn, issues a subcontract to a federally funded DOE or NASA research and development center or NASA field center located in the state may not indemnify the center with respect to products liability, intellectual property, and general liability claims arising out of the activities to be carried out by the center pursuant to the contract.

(c) Notwithstanding any other law, a state agency shall not audit the records of any federally funded DOE or NASA research and development center or NASA field center, but the state agency may rely on the services of any cognizant federal audit agency, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the United States Government Accountability Office, the DOE Office of Inspector General, and the NASA Office of Inspector General, to satisfy auditing requirements.

(d) For purposes of this chapter:

(1) “Federally funded research and development center” means a federally funded research and development center as defined in Subpart 2.1 of Part 2 of Subchapter A of Chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

(2) “NASA field center” means a field center identified as such by NASA and authorized by Title III of the Space Act of 1958.








##### CHAPTER 11. Exemptions [19150- 19150.]  

######### 19150.  
Any contract related to the 2020 United States Census and entered into by the Government Operations Agency or the Office of Planning and Research is exempt from this part.







##### PART 2.5. CONTRACTING BY JUDICIAL BRANCH ENTITIES [19201 - 19210]  

######### 19201.  
This part may be cited as the California Judicial Branch Contract Law.



######### 19202.  
The Legislature finds and declares that placing all public contract provisions for judicial branch entities in one part will make that law clearer and easier to find. Further, it is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this part to achieve the objectives as set forth in Sections 100, 101, and 102.



######### 19203.  
This part shall apply to all contracts initially entered into or amended by judicial branch entities on or after October 1, 2011.



######### 19204.

#### PART 3. CONTRACTING BY LOCAL AGENCIES [20100 - 22178]  

#### CHAPTER 1. Local Agency Public Construction Act [20100 - 20929]  


##### ARTICLE 1. Title [20100 - 20103.7]  

######### 20100.  
This chapter may be cited as the Local Agency Public Construction Act.



######### 20101.  
(a) Except as provided in Section 20111.5, a public entity subject to this part may require that each prospective bidder for a contract complete and submit to the entity a standardized questionnaire and financial statement in a form specified by the entity, including a complete statement of the prospective bidder’s experience in performing public works. The standardized questionnaire may not require prospective bidders to disclose any violations of Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 1720) of Part 7 of Division 2 of the Labor Code committed prior to January 1, 1998, if a violation was based on a subcontractor’s failure to comply with these provisions and the bidder had no knowledge of the subcontractor’s violations. The Department of Industrial Relations, in collaboration with affected agencies and interested parties, shall develop model guidelines for rating bidders, and draft the standardized questionnaire, that may be used by public entities for the purposes of this part. The Department of Industrial Relations, in developing the standardized questionnaire, shall consult with affected public agencies, cities and counties, the construction industry, the surety industry, and other interested parties. The questionnaire and financial statement shall be verified under oath by the bidder in the manner in which civil pleadings in civil actions are verified. The questionnaires and financial statements shall not be public records and shall not be open to public inspection; however, records of the names of contractors applying for prequalification status shall be public records subject to disclosure under Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1 of the Government Code.

(b) Any public entity requiring prospective bidders to complete and submit questionnaires and financial statements, as described in subdivision (a), shall adopt and apply a uniform system of rating bidders on the basis of the completed questionnaires and financial statements, in order to determine both the minimum requirements permitted for qualification to bid, and the type and size of the contracts upon which each bidder shall be deemed qualified to bid. The uniform system of rating prospective bidders shall be based on objective criteria.

(c) A public entity may establish a process for prequalifying prospective bidders pursuant to this section on a quarterly basis and a prequalification pursuant to this process shall be valid for one calendar year following the date of initial prequalification.

(d) Any public entity requiring prospective bidders on a public works project to prequalify pursuant to this section shall establish a process that will allow prospective bidders to dispute their proposed prequalification rating prior to the closing time for receipt of bids. The appeal process shall include the following:

(1) Upon request of the prospective bidder, the public entity shall provide notification to the prospective bidder in writing of the basis for the prospective bidder’s disqualification and any supporting evidence that has been received from others or adduced as a result of an investigation by the public entity.

(2) The prospective bidder shall be given the opportunity to rebut any evidence used as a basis for disqualification and to present evidence to the public entity as to why the prospective bidder should be found qualified.

(3) If the prospective bidder chooses not to avail itself of this process, the proposed prequalification rating may be adopted without further proceedings.

(e) For the purposes of subdivision (a), a financial statement shall not be required from a contractor who has qualified as a Small Business Administration entity pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) of Section 14837 of the Government Code, when the bid is no more than 25 percent of the qualifying amount provided in paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) of Section 14837 of the Government Code.

(f) Nothing in this section shall preclude an awarding agency from prequalifying or disqualifying a subcontractor. The disqualification of a subcontractor by an awarding agency does not disqualify an otherwise prequalified contractor.



######### 20102.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this part to the contrary, where plans and specifications have been prepared by a public agency, whose activities are subject to this part, in order for a public project to be put out for formal or informal bid, and, subsequently, the public agency elects to perform the work by day’s labor, the public agency shall perform the work in strict accordance with these same plans and specifications.

Revisions of the plans and specifications may be made once a justification detailing the specific reasons for the change or changes has been approved by the  public agency or its project director and a copy of the change and its justification is placed in the project file.



######### 20103.5.  
In all contracts subject to this part where federal funds are involved, no bid submitted shall be invalidated by the failure of the bidder to be licensed in accordance with the laws of this state. However, at the time the contract is awarded, the contractor shall be properly licensed in accordance with the laws of this state. The first payment for work or material under any contract shall not be made unless and until the Registrar of Contractors verifies to the agency that the records of the Contractors’ State License Board indicate that the contractor was properly licensed at the time the contract was awarded. Any bidder or contractor not so licensed shall be subject to all legal penalties imposed by law, including, but not limited to, any appropriate disciplinary action by the Contractors’ State License Board. The agency shall include a statement to that effect in the standard form of prequalification questionnaire and financial statement. Failure of the bidder to obtain proper and adequate licensing for an award of a contract shall constitute a failure to execute the contract and shall result in the forfeiture of the security of the bidder.



######### 20103.6.  
(a) (1) Any local agency subject to this chapter shall, in the procurement of architectural design services requiring an expenditure in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000), include in any request for proposals for those services or invitations to bid from a prequalified list for a specific project a disclosure of any contract provision that would require the contracting architect to indemnify and hold harmless the local agency against any and all liability, whether or not caused by the activity of the contracting architect.

(2) The disclosure statement shall be prominently set forth in bold type.

(b) In the event a local agency fails to comply with paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), that local agency shall (1) be precluded from requiring the selected architect to agree to any contract provision requiring the selected architect to indemnify or hold harmless the local agency against any and all liability not caused by the activity of the selected architect, (2) cease discussions with the selected architect and reopen the request for proposals or invitations to bid from a qualification list, or (3) mutually agree to an indemnity clause acceptable to both parties.

(c) This section shall become operative on July 1, 1998.



######### 20103.7.  
A local agency subject to this chapter taking bids for the construction of a public work or improvement shall, upon request from a contractor plan room service, provide an electronic copy of a project’s contract documents at no charge to the contractor plan room.









##### ARTICLE 1.3. Award of Contracts [20103.8- 20103.8.]  

######### 20103.8.  
A local agency may require a bid for a public works contract to include prices for items that may be added to, or deducted from, the scope of work in the contract for which the bid is being submitted.  Whenever additive or deductive items are included in a bid, the bid solicitation shall specify which one of the following methods will be used to determine the lowest bid.  In the absence of a specification, only the method provided by subdivision (a) will be used:

(a) The lowest bid shall be the lowest bid price on the base contract without consideration of the prices on the additive or deductive items.

(b) The lowest bid shall be the lowest total of the bid prices on the base contract and those additive or deductive items that were specifically identified in the bid solicitation as being used for the purpose of determining the lowest bid price.

(c) The lowest bid shall be the lowest total of the bid prices on the base contract and those additive or deductive items that when taken in order from a specifically identified list of those items in the solicitation, and added to, or subtracted from, the base contract, are less than, or equal to, a funding amount publicly disclosed by the local agency before the first bid is opened.

(d) The lowest bid shall be determined in a manner that prevents any information that would identify any of the bidders or proposed subcontractors or suppliers from being revealed to the public entity before the ranking of all bidders from lowest to highest has been determined.

A responsible bidder who submitted the lowest bid as determined by this section shall be awarded the contract, if it is awarded.  This section does not preclude the local agency from adding to or deducting from the contract any of the additive or deductive items after the lowest responsible bidder has been determined.

(e) Nothing in this section shall preclude the prequalification of subcontractors.

##### ARTICLE 1.7. Modifications; Performance; Payment [20104.50- 20104.50.]  

######### 20104.50.  
(a) (1) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to require all local governments to pay their contractors on time so that these contractors can meet their own obligations.  In requiring prompt payment by all local governments, the Legislature hereby finds and declares that the prompt payment of outstanding receipts is not merely a municipal affair, but is, instead, a matter of statewide concern.

(2) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this article to fully occupy the field of public policy relating to the prompt payment of local governments’ outstanding receipts.  The Legislature finds and declares that all government officials, including those in local government, must set a standard of prompt payment that any business in the private sector which may contract for services should look towards for guidance.

(b) Any local agency which fails to make any progress payment within 30 days after receipt of an undisputed and properly submitted payment request from a contractor on a construction contract shall pay interest to the contractor equivalent to the legal rate set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 685.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

(2) There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a successful bidder who has been convicted of a violation of any provision of Division 4 (commencing with Section 3200) of the Labor Code or of the Unemployment Insurance Code, or of both, was awarded the bid because that successful bidder was able to lower the bid due to this violation or these violations occurring on the contract for public work awarded by the public agency.  

(b) In an action brought pursuant to this section, the court may award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, in an amount to be determined in the court’s discretion, to the prevailing party.

(b) For purposes of this section, day labor shall include the use of maintenance personnel employed on a permanent or temporary basis.



######### 20115.  
For purposes of Section 20114, “maintenance” means routine, recurring, and usual work for the preservation, protection, and keeping of any publicly owned or publicly operated facility for its intended purposes in a safe and continually usable condition for which it was designed, improved, constructed, altered, or repaired. “Facility” means any plant, building, structure, ground facility, utility system, or real property.

This definition does not include, among other types of work, janitorial or custodial services and protection of the sort provided by guards or other security forces.

It is the intent of the Legislature that this definition does not include painting, repainting, or decorating other than touchup, but instead it is the intent of the Legislature that such activities be controlled directly by the provisions of Section 20114.



######### 20116.  
It shall be unlawful to split or separate into smaller work orders or projects any work, project, service, or purchase for the purpose of evading the provisions of this article requiring contracting after competitive bidding.

Informal bidding may be used on work, projects, services, or purchases that cost up to the limits set forth in this article.  For the purpose of securing informal bids, the board shall publish annually in a newspaper of general circulation published in the district, or if there is no such newspaper, then in some newspaper in general circulation in the county, a notice inviting contractors to register to be notified of future informal bidding projects. All contractors included on the informal bidding list shall be given notice of all informal bid projects in any manner as the district deems appropriate.



######### 20117.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the event there are two or more identical lowest or highest bids, as the case may be, submitted to a school district for the purchase, sale, or lease of real property, supplies, materials, equipment, services, bonds, or the awarding of any contract, pursuant to a provision requiring competitive bidding, the governing board of any school district may determine by lot which bid shall be accepted.



######### 20118.  
Notwithstanding Sections 20111 and 20112, the governing board of any school district, without advertising for bids, if the board has determined it to be in the best interests of the district, may authorize by contract, lease, requisition, or purchase order, any public corporation or agency, including any county, city, town, or district, to lease data-processing equipment, purchase materials, supplies, equipment, automotive vehicles, tractors, and other personal property for the district in the manner in which the public corporation or agency is authorized by law to make the leases or purchases from a vendor. Upon receipt of the personal property, if the property complies with the specifications set forth in the contract, lease, requisition, or purchase order, the school district may draw a warrant in favor of the public corporation or agency for the amount of the approved invoice, including the reasonable costs to the public corporation or agency for furnishing the services incidental to the lease or purchase of the personal property, or the school district may make payment directly to the vendor. Alternatively, if there is an existing contract between a public corporation or agency and a vendor for the lease or purchase of the personal property, a school district may authorize the lease or purchase of personal property directly from the vendor by contract, lease, requisition, or purchase order and make payment to the vendor under the same terms that are available to the public corporation or agency under the contract.

The governing board of any school district may contract with an acceptable party who is one of the three lowest responsible bidders for the procurement or maintenance, or both, of electronic data-processing systems and supporting software in any manner the board deems appropriate.



######### 20118.2.  
(a) Due to the highly specialized and unique nature of technology, telecommunications, related equipment, software, and services, because products and materials of that nature are undergoing rapid technological changes, and in order to allow for the introduction of new technological changes into the operations of the school district, it is in the public’s best interest to allow a school district to consider, in addition to price, factors such as vendor financing, performance reliability, standardization, life-cycle costs, delivery timetables, support logistics, the broadest possible range of competing products and materials available, fitness of purchase, manufacturer’s warranties, and similar factors in the award of contracts for technology, telecommunications, related equipment, software, and services.

(b) This section applies only to a school district’s procurement of computers, software, telecommunications equipment, microwave equipment, and other related electronic equipment and apparatus. This section does not apply to contracts for construction or for the procurement of any product that is available in substantial quantities to the general public.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 20118.1, a school district may, after a finding is made by the governing board that a particular procurement qualifies under subdivision (b), authorize the procurement of the product through competitive negotiation as described in subdivision (d).

(d) For purposes of this section, competitive negotiation includes, but is not limited to, all of the following requirements:

(1) A request for proposals shall be prepared and submitted to an adequate number of qualified sources, as determined by the school district, to permit reasonable competition consistent with the nature and requirement of the procurement.

(2) Notice of the request for proposals shall be published at least twice in a newspaper of general circulation, at least 10 days before the date for receipt of the proposals.

(3) The school district shall make every effort to generate the maximum feasible number of proposals from qualified sources and shall make a finding to that effect before proceeding to negotiate if only a single response to the request for proposals is received.

(4) The request for proposals shall identify all significant evaluation factors, including price, and their relative importance.

(5) The school district shall provide reasonable procedures for the technical evaluation of the proposals received, the identification of qualified sources, and the selection for the award of the contract.

(6) Award shall be made to the qualified bidder whose proposal meets the evaluation standards and will be most advantageous to the school district with price and all other factors considered.

(7) If award is not made to the bidder whose proposal contains the lowest price, the school district shall make a finding setting forth the basis for the award.

(e) The school district, at its discretion, may reject all proposals and request new proposals.

(f) Provisions in any contract concerning utilization of small business enterprises, that are in accordance with the request for proposals, shall not be subject to negotiation with the successful proposer.



######### 20118.3.  
The governing board of any school district may purchase supplementary textbooks, library books, educational films, audiovisual materials, test materials, workbooks, instructional computer software packages, or periodicals in any amount needed for the operation of the schools of the district without taking estimates or advertising for bids.

This section shall become operative January 1, 1989, and is declaratory of existing law and practice.



######### 20118.4.  
(a) If any change or alteration of a contract governed by Article 3 (commencing with Section 17595) of Chapter 5 of Part 10.5 of the Education Code is ordered by the governing board of the district, the change or alteration shall be specified in writing and the cost agreed upon between the governing board and the contractor. The board may authorize the contractor to proceed with performance of the change or alteration, without the formality of securing bids, if the cost so agreed upon does not exceed the greater of the following:

(1) The amount specified in Section 20111 or 20114, whichever is applicable to the original contract.

(2) Ten percent of the original contract price.

(b) The governing board of any school district, or of two or more school districts governed by governing boards of identical personnel, having an average daily attendance of 400,000 or more as shown by the annual report of the county superintendent of schools for the preceding year, may also authorize any change or alteration of a contract for reconstruction or rehabilitation work, other than for the construction of new buildings or other new structures, if the cost of the change or alteration is in excess of the limitations in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (a) but does not exceed 25 percent of the original contract price, without the formality of securing bids, and the change or alteration is a necessary and integral part of the work under the contract and the taking of bids would delay the completion of the contract. Changes exceeding 15 percent of the original contract price shall be approved by an affirmative vote of not less than 75 percent of the members of the governing board.

######### 20406.  
If the board of supervisors is advised by the county surveyor or, in a county not having a county surveyor, by the officer having similar duties and authority, that the work can be done for a sum less than the lowest responsible bid, the board may reject all bids and order the work done by day labor, under the supervision and direction of the county surveyor or officer having similar duties and authority. In such case, the road commissioners in their respective districts shall employ all labor required, and direct the conduct of the work.



######### 20407.  
In the event of great emergency, including, but not limited to, states of disaster defined in Section 8558 of the Government Code, upon the majority vote of the board, the board may proceed at once to replace or repair any and all bridges without adopting plans, specifications, strain sheets, or working details and without letting contracts or calling for bids. The work may be done by day labor under the direction of the board or by contract, or by a combination of the two. If done wholly or in part by contract, the contractor shall be paid the actual cost of the use of machinery and tools and of material and labor expended by him or her in doing the work, plus not more than 15 percent to cover all profits, supervision, and any other expense. No more than the lowest current market prices shall be paid for materials.



######### 20409.

The cost of such construction, maintenance or repair shall be paid out of the county road funds or out of the county general fund.









##### ARTICLE 27. Legislative Bodies—Improvement Act of 1911 [20410 - 20464]  

######### 20410.  
The provisions of this article shall apply to contracts by legislative bodies for the doing of work or the furnishing of materials, supplies and equipment, as provided for in the Improvement Act of 1911, Division 7 (commencing with Section 5000) of the Streets and Highways Code.



######### 20411.  
Before the legislative body awards any contract for doing any work or for furnishing materials, supplies and equipment or any portion thereof, authorized by this division, the legislative body shall pass a resolution ordering the work.



######### 20412.  
Notice shall be posted inviting sealed proposals or bids for doing such work, or for furnishing materials, supplies and equipment or any portion thereof. Notice inviting such proposals, and referring to the specifications on file, shall be published, but if there is no newspaper published in the city, then it shall only be posted. The time fixed for the opening of the bids shall be not less than 10 days from the time of the first publication or posting of the notice.

Said notices shall state the estimated cost of any acquisition, which estimated cost is required to be advanced as a part of the incidental expenses referred to in Section 5256 of the Streets and Highways Code, at the time of entering into the contract.



######### 20413.  
All bids for construction work shall be presented under sealed cover and shall be accompanied by one of the following forms of bidder’s security:

(a) Cash.

(b) A cashier’s check made payable to the city.

(c) A certified check made payable to the city.

(d) A bidder’s bond executed by an admitted surety insurer, made payable to the city.

The security shall be in an amount equal to at least 10 percent of the amount of the bid. No bid shall be considered unless one of the forms of bidder’s security is enclosed with it.

Upon an award to the lowest bidder, the security of an unsuccessful bidder shall be returned in a reasonable period of time, but in no event shall that security be held by the city beyond 60 days from the time the award is made.



######### 20414.  
The proposals or bids shall be delivered to the clerk, or any other officer designated by the legislative body, and the legislative body shall, in open session publicly open, examine and declare the same. If the legislative body by resolution so provides the proposals or bids may be opened, examined and declared by an officer designated in the resolution. Any such resolution shall require that the proposals or bids be opened at a public meeting called by the officer designated who shall report the results of the bidding to the legislative body at the next regular meeting after the opening of the bids. In the event of such resolution the notice inviting bids shall state the time and place of said public meeting and the officer so designated. No proposal or bid shall be considered unless accompanied by the check or bond satisfactory to the legislative body.



######### 20415.  
The legislative body may reject any and all proposals or bids should it deem this for the public good, and also the bid of any party who has been delinquent or unfaithful in any former contract with the city, and shall reject all proposals or bids other than the lowest regular proposal or bid of any responsible bidder, and may award the contract for said work or improvement to the lowest responsible bidder at the prices named in his bid. If the bids are rejected the legislative body shall thereupon return to each bidder the check or bond which accompanied his bid.



######### 20416.  
Whenever the total amount bid by the lowest responsible bidder plus the estimated amount of incidental costs would result in assessments under this division which exceed by more than 15 percent the engineer’s estimate of cost of the proposed work to be assessed, as stated in the “Notice of Improvement” referred to in Section 5193 of the Streets and Highways Code, the legislative body shall direct the clerk to give notice by mail of such increase over the estimated cost.



######### 20417.  
If the bids are rejected or no bids are received the legislative body may readvertise for proposals or bids for the performance of the work as in the first instance, without further proceedings, and thereafter proceed in the manner provided in this chapter.



######### 20418.  
The check or bond accompanying any proposal or bid which is accepted shall be held by the clerk until the contract for doing the work has been entered into, either by the lowest bidder or by the owners of three-fourths part of the frontage, whereupon the certified check or bond shall be returned to the bidder. If the bidder fails, neglects or refuses to enter into the contract to perform the work, the certified check accompanying his bid and the amount therein mentioned, shall be declared to be forfeited to the city and shall be collected by it and paid into the general fund, and any bond forfeited may be prosecuted, and the amount due thereon collected and paid into the general fund.



######### 20419.  
If any local, state or national agency or authority contributes the labor, or labor and any portion of the materials, supplies or equipment necessary for the construction of any improvement authorized under this division, the contract shall be for only those items which are not contributed by any such agency or authority. If proposals or bids are invited only for the furnishing of materials, supplies and equipment or any portion thereof not furnished by such agency or authority, the notice shall contain a statement to the effect that the legislative body may cancel the order for any undelivered materials, supplies or equipment by giving the successful bidder 24 hours notice of the cancellation, in which event the successful bidder will be entitled to compensation for only so much of the material, supplies and equipment as has been used prior to the giving of such notice of cancellation at the prescribed unit rates stated in the contract, and that the contractor shall agree to accept the return of any and all materials and supplies not used prior to the giving of such notice.



######### 20420.  
Notice of the award of the contract shall be published by the clerk.

The clerk shall, upon payment of the statutory fee prescribed therefor, record a notice of the award of contract in the office of the county recorder. Said recordation shall constitute notice to all persons that all property within the boundaries of the proposed assessment district shall be assessed at the time of the confirmation of the assessment under Chapter 16 (commencing at Section 5360) of Part 3 of Division 7 of the Streets and Highways Code to pay the costs of the improvement in proportion to the benefits which the property receives from the improvement, notwithstanding the acquisition of the property by the state or any of its agencies, or by any county, city, municipality or other public or municipal corporation. Said notice shall be substantially as follows:

######### 20421.  
The owners of three-fourths of the area of lands liable to be assessed, or their agents (who shall make oath that they are the owners or agents) are not required to present sealed proposals or bids, but may within 10 days after the first publication, or first posting if there is no publication, of the notice of the award of the contract, elect to take the work and enter into a written contract to do the whole work at the price at which the contract has been awarded. All work done under the written contract is subject to regulations which may be prescribed by ordinance of the legislative body.



######### 20422.  
If the owners fail to elect to take the work, and to enter into a written contract therefor within 10 days, or to commence the work within 15 days after the date of the written contract, and to prosecute the work with diligence to completion, the superintendent of streets shall enter into a contract with the original bidder to whom the contract was awarded, and at the prices specified in his or her bid.



######### 20423.  
If the original bidder neglects, fails or refuses, for 25 days after the first publication of the notice of the award of the contract, to enter into the contract, the legislative body, without further proceedings, shall again advertise for and receive proposals or bids, as in the first instance, and award the contract for the work to the then lowest regular bidder.



######### 20424.  
If no bids are received in response to this second call for bids, the legislative body may again advertise for and receive bids under the same proceedings at any time and let the contract to the then lowest bidder, and such delay shall in no way affect the validity of any of the proceedings or assessments levied thereunder.



######### 20425.  
The bids of all persons and the election of all owners who have previously failed to enter into the contract shall be rejected in any bidding or election subsequent to the first for the same work.



######### 20426.  
All contractors, contracting owners included, shall, at the time of executing any contract for the work, execute a bond to the satisfaction and approval of the superintendent of streets and payable to the city, in a sum not less than 25 percent of the amount of the contract, conditioned upon the faithful performance of the contract.



######### 20427.  
At any time prior to publication and posting notice inviting bids, the legislative body by resolution, may determine that if the contractor, contracting owners included, does not complete the work within the time limit specified in the contract or within the further time that the legislative body authorized, the contractor or contracting owners, as the case may be, shall pay to the city liquidated damages in the amount fixed by the legislative body in the resolution. The amount so fixed is valid as liquidated damages unless manifestly unreasonable under the circumstances existing at the time the contract was made. If this determination is made, the plans or specifications and the contract shall contain provisions in accordance with that determination.

Any moneys received by the city on account of those liquidated damages shall be applied as follows:

(1) If received prior to confirmation of the assessment, those moneys shall be applied as a contribution against the assessment.

(2) If received after the confirmation of the assessment, those moneys shall be applied in the manner provided in Section 5132.05 of the Streets and Highways Code for the disposition of excess acquisition funds.

(3) If a contribution has previously been made or ordered by any agency, the legislative body may order a refund to the contributing agency in the proportion that the contribution bears to the total costs and expenses of the work.



######### 20428.  
If the owner or contractor who may have taken any contract does not complete the work within the time limited in the contract, or within such further time as the legislative body may give him, or abandons or fails to proceed with the work, the legislative body may declare him in default and may either relet all or any portion of the work, or it may complete the work by direct purchase of labor and materials, and the owner or contractor shall pay to the city the entire cost of completing the work before the warrant is delivered to the owner or contractor.

Notice of the declaration of default shall be given by the clerk of the legislative body to the owner or contractor by personal service or by mail. Upon receipt of such notice, the owner or contractor shall forthwith quit the work, and shall receive no payment for any work performed thereafter, unless ordered by the legislative body to resume the work.



######### 20429.  
Before being entitled to a contract, the bidder to whom the award was made, or the owners who have elected to take the contract, must advance to the superintendent of streets, for payment by him, the cost of publication of the notices, resolutions, orders and matters required under the proceedings prescribed in this division, and of such other notice as may be deemed requisite by the legislative body, together with all other incidental expenses incurred up to the time of entering into the contract, including the estimated cost of any acquisition which the legislative body may determine to be payable at said time, but limited to the amount specified in the notice inviting bids pursuant to Section 5241 of the Streets and Highways Code. All other acquisition costs shall be payable at the time of the delivery to the contractor, or his agent, or assigns, of the warrant, assessment and diagram as provided in Section 5375 of the Streets and Highways Code. The legislative body may waive the payment in advance of all or any part of the incidental expenses and acquisition costs by resolution adopted not later than the time of ordering the work. The waiver must appear in the notice inviting bids.



######### 20430.  
If the work is abandoned by the city before work is actually started or before any materials, supplies or equipment have been furnished or used, the incidental expenses incurred previous to such abandonment shall be paid out of the city treasury, but such expense for which the city is liable and which shall have been paid by it may be charged as incidental expenses against the district benefited in any new proceeding had or taken for any work which includes substantially the same work as that which was included in the abandoned proceedings.



######### 20431.  
At any time within 10 days from the date of the first publication of the notice of award of the contract, any owner of, or other persons having any interest in, any lot or land liable to assessment, who claims that any of the previous acts or proceedings relating to the work are irregular, defective, erroneous or faulty, may file with the clerk a written notice specifying in what respect the said acts and proceedings are irregular, defective, erroneous or faulty. The notice shall state that it is made pursuant to this section.



######### 20432.  
All objections to any act or proceeding occurring prior to the time within which such objections are permitted to be filed in relation to the work, not made in writing and in the manner and at the time specified, shall be waived, if the resolution of intention to do the work has been actually published, as provided in this division.



######### 20433.  
If in the opinion of the legislative body the public interest will not be served by allowing the property owners to take the contract it may so provide in the resolution of intention.



######### 20434.  
An action to determine the validity of proceedings relating to the work and the validity of any contract entered or to be entered into pursuant thereto may be brought by the legislative body or by the contractor pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 860) of Title 10 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. For such purpose proceedings shall be deemed to be in existence upon the award of the contract. An action may be commenced and concluded by the legislative body before the publication of the notice inviting bids, and for such purpose the proceedings shall be deemed to be in existence upon the adoption of the resolution ordering the work.



######### 20435.  
In such action, all findings, conclusions and determinations of the legislative body which conducted the proceedings shall be conclusive in the absence of actual fraud.



######### 20436.  
If an action is commenced under the provisions of this chapter to determine the validity of any contract or proposed contract, and the contract has not been signed, the contractor shall not be obligated to sign the same until a judgment sustaining the validity of the proceedings and the proposed contract has become final. If the contractor has signed and executed the contract, he shall not be obligated to begin work until a judgment sustaining the validity of the proceedings and the contract has become final. If a judgment is entered holding the contract invalid, the contractor shall be discharged and relieved of all obligation under the contract, and he and his sureties shall be discharged and relieved of all obligation upon any bond required by law in connection with such contract.



######### 20436.5.  
Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the action authorized by this chapter shall not be brought by any person other than the legislative body or the contractor, nor shall the action be brought after the date fixed for the beginning of work.



######### 20437.  
The superintendent of streets is hereby authorized in his official capacity to make all written contracts, and to receive all bonds authorized by this division and to do any other act, either expressly or impliedly required by this division, that pertains to the street department.



######### 20438.  
He shall fix the time for the commencement, which shall not be more than 45 days from the date of the contract, and for the completion of the work under each contract entered into by him. The work shall be prosecuted with diligence from day to day thereafter to completion.



######### 20439.  
He may extend the time fixed for completion of the work from time to time, under the direction of the legislative body. All applications for extensions of time, if in writing, must be filed in the office of the clerk before the expiration of the original time fixed in the contract, or of the time granted by extension, as the case may be. An extension of time may be granted by the legislative body after the expiration of the time originally fixed in the contract or as previously extended, and the extension so granted shall be deemed to commence and be effective from the date of such expiration. Any extension of time shall not release the sureties upon any bond required under this division.



######### 20440.  
The work, in all cases, shall be done under the direction and to the satisfaction of the superintendent of streets and the materials used shall comply with the specifications and be to the satisfaction of the superintendent of streets and all contracts made therefor shall contain a provision to that effect unless the legislative body by resolution adopted within 10 days after the passage of the resolution ordering the work directs that the work shall be done under the direction of the engineer and the materials used shall comply with the specifications and be to the satisfaction of the engineer, instead of the superintendent of streets, and in such case the contract shall contain a provision to that effect.



######### 20441.  
The legislative body also may by resolution adopted within 10 days after the passage of the resolution ordering the work provide and direct that the assessment thereafter to be made in the proceeding shall be made and signed by the engineer instead of by the superintendent of streets.



######### 20442.  
The contract shall contain express notice that, in no case, except where it is otherwise provided by law or by charter will the city, or any officer thereof, be liable for any portion of the expense, nor for any delinquency of persons or property assessed.



######### 20443.  
The legislative body may, by ordinance, prescribe general rules directing the superintendent of streets or the engineer, as the case may be, and the contractor as to the materials to be used, and the mode of executing the work, under all contracts thereafter made. The assessment and apportionment of the expenses of all such work shall be made by the superintendent of streets or the engineer, as the case may be, in the mode provided by this division.



######### 20444.  
If any fiscal agent of the United States government contributes any money or materials to be used in the construction of any work provided for in this division, the requirements of the agency contributing such money or materials may be incorporated in the contract.



######### 20445.  
If a contribution of labor or of labor and any portion of materials, supplies or equipment is to be made by any local, state or national agency or authority, the contract shall contain a provision that the legislative body may cancel the order for any undelivered materials, supplies or equipment by giving the contractor 24 hours notice of said cancellation, and require the contractor to accept the return of the unused materials and supplies, in which event the contractor will be entitled to compensation for only so much of the materials, supplies and equipment as has been used prior to the giving of such notice. The contract shall also contain a provision that no materials, supplies or equipment shall be delivered until a delivery permit signed by the superintendent of streets has been received by the contractor.



######### 20446.  
“Changes” as used in this chapter shall include corrections, alterations, modifications, additions, omissions, increases or decreases.



######### 20447.  
Unless the power to proceed shall have ceased at the conclusion of the hearing on the resolution of intention because of a majority protest, at any time before the confirmation of the assessment the legislative body may make changes in, to or from the boundaries of the proposed assessment district, the work proposed to be done, or any act, determination or provision made, or permitted to be made, by the legislative body under and pursuant to this division, which act, determination or provision does not affect the jurisdiction of the legislative body to order the work or improvement; provided, that after the award of the contract no such changes shall be made without the written consent of the contractor or the bidder to whom the contract shall have been awarded. The legislative body shall not change the boundaries to include any territory which will not, in its judgment, be benefited by the work.



######### 20448.  
At the hearing on the resolution of intention, the legislative body, without further notice and hearing, may order any changes, as defined in Sections 20446 and 20447, except changes to include additional territory in the assessment district. Any changes to include additional territory and all changes after the hearing on the resolution of intention shall be ordered only as provided in this chapter.



######### 20449.  
Before ordering any changes made, the legislative body shall adopt a resolution briefly describing the changes proposed to be made, stating the amount of the estimated increase or decrease in the cost of the work by reason of the proposed changes and giving notice of a time and place when and where any interested person having any objection to the changes proposed to be made may appear before the legislative body and show cause why the changes should not be ordered. The resolution shall also contain the name and telephone number of a local department or agency designated by the legislative body to answer inquiries regarding the hearing proceedings. Such notice shall be omitted if the hearing of objections is not required as provided hereunder. The resolution may describe the changes by referring to maps, plats, plans, profiles, detailed drawings, or specifications on file in the office of the clerk or engineer, which shall indicate the changes proposed to be made and which shall govern for all details thereof. The resolution shall be published pursuant to Section 6061 of the Government Code, at least 10 days prior to the date of the hearing.

Suit against the sureties on the bond of the contractor filed pursuant to this chapter may be brought by any claimant, or his assigns, at any time after the claimant has ceased to perform labor or furnish materials or both and until the expiration of six months after the period in which verified claims may be filed.

Upon the trial of the action, the court shall award to the prevailing party a reasonable attorney’s fee, to be taxed as costs, and to be included in the judgment therein rendered.

The basis for any adjustments to the community college district estimate is to be documented. If the contractor’s proposal for a given job order is found to be unreasonable, not cost effective, or undesirable, the community college district is under no obligation to issue the job order to the job order contractor, and may instead utilize any other available procurement procedures.

Such bond shall be conditioned for the faithful execution of the contract by the contractor, and for the payment by him or her for all labor and materials furnished for or in the doing of the work. The form and sufficiency of said bond shall be passed upon by some member of the board of supervisors, and such bond shall inure as well to the benefit of any and all persons furnishing labor or materials for the work as to that of the county.

By said contract the county shall undertake that the board of supervisors will, upon the fulfillment and performance of the contract on the part of the contractor, and under the provisions of the Drainage District Improvement Act of 1919 take all steps, in or by said act authorized to be taken, to effect the issuing by the county treasurer of the bonds in said act authorized to be issued, and provide a fund for their payment, as in or by said act prescribed. The contract shall state that in no case shall the county be liable thereunder, nor any officer thereof be beholden thereunder except for the discharge of official duty under the law.



######### 21009.  
If the contractor shall fail to begin in good faith the work provided for in said contract within the time in said contract set forth, or shall fail thereafter to prosecute said work in a workmanlike and diligent manner, or shall fail in any other respect to carry out the terms of said contract, then the board of supervisors shall cause written notice to be served upon said contractor, specifying the particular areas in which he or she is not fulfilling the requirements of said contract, and if for a period of three days thereafter said contractor shall fail to remedy the defects set forth in said notice, and to prosecute said work thereafter with diligence and in a workmanlike manner, then the board of supervisors shall either take over said contract and complete said work, or shall relet said contract, without the necessity of advertising for bids, and cause the work to be completed, and shall declare the bond given by said contractor forfeited and order suit brought thereon, and all moneys collected therefrom shall be paid into the interest and sinking fund of the district.



######### 21010.  
If the contractor fails to pay for any labor or material furnished for or in the doing of said work by any person, such person may within 90 days after the making of the final order hereinafter referred to, file with the county treasurer a verified statement of such facts, and such person may thereafter, within six months after the filing of such statement, bring an action on said bond in his or her own name, or if the person has assigned his or her claim, the action may be brought in the name of the assignee; provided, however, that the right of the county to recover on said bond shall be superior to the rights of any such person to recover thereon; provided, moreover, that if such statement shall be filed before the expiration of 20 days from the making of such final order, then the county treasurer shall be authorized to withhold from the contractor sufficient of the bonds, issued as herein provided, to satisfy said claim, and costs, which can reasonably be anticipated.



######### 21011.  
(a) As soon as in good faith may be done, there shall be filed with the clerk of the board of supervisors a declaration that the work has been completed according to the contract, together with an itemized statement of all the incidental costs and expenses of the work and the cost of the proceedings inclusive of the estimated cost of publishing the notice of final hearing hereinafter provided. The aggregate amount of such items shall be stated, and also the amount due under the contract; and also the gross sum for a bond issue representing the entire amount thereof, as claimed by the contractor. The said declaration and statements shall be signed and verified by the engineer of construction and by the contractor or by some person cognizant of the facts signing on his or her behalf and stating why he or she, instead of the contractor, so signs and verifies. Either signer may except from his or her signature and verification any amount or item to which he or she does not assent. The chairman of the board of supervisors shall fix a time for a hearing, to be known as the final hearing, for the purpose of determining whether the work shall be accepted as completed according to the contract, and for determining the aggregate amount for which bonds shall be issued representing the total costs of the work and the incidental costs and expenses of the work and the proceedings, all of which have been charged to and are payable by the contractor. Notice of such hearing shall be given and may, in form, and shall, in substance be as follows (filling the blanks):

(b) Such notice shall be signed by the chairman of the board of supervisors and attested by the clerk of the board of supervisors and published by at least two insertions in the newspaper or newspapers designated in the resolution of intention, and a copy or copies thereof posted and kept posted for two days at or near the chamber door of the board of supervisors, the first day of such publication and that of such posting (they need not be simultaneous) to be not less than five days before the day in said notice specified for the hearing. Proof of such publication shall be made by affidavit or affidavits, and the same shall be filed. If a quorum is not present at the time specified in the notice of the hearing, the members of the board then present may continue the hearing; and at all stages the hearing may, by resolution entered in the minutes, be continued from time to time. At any time before the day in said notice specified for the hearing any property owner may file written objection to the acceptance of the work on the ground that the work has not been completed or done according to the contract, specifying in ordinary language the particulars in which the work has not been so completed or done. Any person interested in the proceeding, as of the interest of the contractor, shall be presumed to take issue with such objection and shall be heard accordingly. Questions as to the incidental costs or expenses of the work or the proceedings may be raised orally by any property owner within the district. Evidence may be adduced as to any of the matters to be determined, and in such order as the board may direct. If, when the matter has been fully heard, whether under, or in the absence of, objections, the board of supervisors is of the opinion that the work has not been completed or done according to the contract, it shall in writing specify what must be done in order to complete the work, and shall, by an order or resolution to be entered in its minutes, continue the further hearing of the whole matter to a specified day, expressly stating that such continuance is for the purpose of enabling the contractor to complete his or her contract. On said continued hearing, the objections to the work filed before the day of the first hearing shall continue in force, and evidence shall be received, if offered, as to what has been done by way of completing the contract in the particulars specified in the order of the board on the said continuance of the hearing. If, upon such continued hearing, the board is of the opinion that the work is still uncompleted in the particulars as to which it was ordered to be completed, it shall be discretional with said board to order or refuse a second continuance of the hearing. If the board does order such second continuance, it shall be ordered in the same manner, with like effect as upon the first continuance, and likewise as to a second and any other or further continuance. Objections to any item of incidental costs and expenses shall pend and be heard on said day, or at any continued hearing had as above in this section provided. Every continuance of said hearing for the purpose of enabling the contractor to complete his or her contract or the work shall continue or revive such powers in the proceeding as the board of supervisors had under the provisions of this act, at the time of the filing of the contractor’s declaration that the work was completed, as above provided, and also operate to extend the time for the completion of said contract in such manner that its completion within the time to which the hearing is continued, shall be as valid performance of such contract as if completed at the time of filing such declaration.



######### 21012.  
Whenever upon the hearing in Section 21011 provided, whether original or continued, the board shall be of the opinion that the work has been completed and done according to the contract, said board shall by resolution to be entered upon its minutes so declare, and shall in said resolution declare that the work is accepted and the amount of the contract price for doing the work and the amount of the incidental costs and expenses of the work and proceedings and the aggregate amount for which bonds are to be issued and shall make final order that bonds be issued therefor as hereinafter provided. The decision and determination of said board at the hearing provided for in Section 21011 shall, as to all matters determined at said hearing and as to all errors, informalities, irregularities, or omissions which said board might have avoided or remedied during the progress of the proceedings, or which it can at that time remedy, be final and conclusive upon all persons entitled to be heard before said board on said matters, and no assessment or tax levied for the payment of the bonds, and the interest thereon, to be issued for said work and expenses, shall be held invalid by any court for any error, informality, omission, or other defect in the proceedings where the resolution of intention has been actually published as in this act provided, before the said board shall have ordered the work to be done.



######### 21013.  
(a) Whenever any court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that any contract purporting to have been made, or any proceedings, steps or actions purporting to have been taken, or any bond or bonds issued under this act, is or are void, invalid or unenforceable, or shall for any cause enjoin the issuance of any bonds proposed to be issued under this act, or shall enjoin the performance of the work or improvement or the making of an assessment upon the lands within the district, or shall quiet title of any lot or parcel of land against the lien of any such bonds or assessments, said court shall also determine whether any work has been done or improvements have been made in good faith by any contractor under said invalid contract or proceeding or under any contract pursuant to which bonds were issued, or are proposed to be issued, and if so what part, if any, of said work or improvement was of such kind as might have been ordered under the provisions of this act. If the court shall find that any work or improvement of such kind as might have been ordered under this act has been done or performed in good faith by any contractor under or in pursuance to a contract purporting to have been made under the provisions of this act, then the said court shall direct the board of supervisors, who conducted the proceeding, to take proceedings as in this section provided for the issuing of new bonds to cover the reasonable value of said work or improvement. The board of supervisors may also without any decree of court, upon written application of a contractor, who may have done or performed in good faith any work or improvement pursuant to a contract purporting to have been made under this act, or of the assignee of such contractor, after the work or improvement shall have been accepted, determine that the proceeding authorizing said work or improvement or the acceptance thereof are for any reason invalid, and direct that new proceedings be initiated as provided in this section for the issuance of bonds to cover the reasonable value of so much of said work or improvement as is of a kind which might have been ordered and performed under this act.

(b) It is hereby declared to be the true intent and meaning of this section to make the cost and expenses of all work or improvements made or to be made through an attempted compliance with the provisions of this act payable by the lands benefited or to be benefited by such work or improvement, by the issuance of new bonds to defray the expenses thereof, but that all payments of principal or interest on void or unenforceable assessments or bonds shall be credited to the property against which they were assessed or attempted to be assessed.

(c) Upon a decree of court or an order of the board of supervisors having been made as above provided, said board shall cause to be made by the county surveyor, or some other county officer or by some other competent person appointed by it for that purpose, a report for a proposed new bond issue. Said report shall set forth a description of the work or improvement done or performed by said contractor or his or her assignee pursuant to the contract referred to in said decree of court or order of the board, which work or improvement has been found by said court or said board to be of such kind as might have been ordered under this act, and shall state the reasonable value of said work or improvement (which shall not exceed the aggregate of the original contract price for said work or improvement, together with the incidental expenses of the original proceedings for said work or improvement, and if the work or improvement has been accepted it shall also include interest upon said total from the date of the original acceptance of said work or improvement by the board of supervisors at the same rate proposed for the new bond issue). Said report shall contain a description of the district benefited by said improvement. In the event that the original proceedings contemplated an assessment upon lands within the district in accordance with the provisions of Section 12 of Chapter 354 of the Statutes of 1919 of this act then said report shall contain a proposed assessment of each separate parcel of land within the district benefited by said improvement, which assessment shall conform as nearly as may be with the report required by Section 12 of Chapter 354 of the Statutes of 1919 hereof, and shall be accompanied by a map or plat as therein provided.

(d) In the event any payments have been made on the principal or interest of any bonds previously issued, which have been declared invalid, by the payment of any special assessment taxes, by the owners of land within the assessment district, the amounts of such payments shall be ascertained and deducted from the amount for which new bonds are to be issued under this section and said report shall set forth the amount of the payments made and state that a credit or offset is to be made for said amount in the issuance of such new bonds.

(e) Upon the filing of said report the board of supervisors shall fix a day, hour, and place, for a hearing thereon, which time shall not be less than 20 days after the time of filing said report, and shall direct the clerk of the board to give notice of the filing of the report and of the hearing. The clerk shall thereupon cause notice of the time and place of such hearing to be given by publication in the newspaper designated in the resolution of intention by at least two insertions therein not more than eight days apart. When, before the day of hearing specified in said notice, 20 days, including Sundays and holidays, have elapsed since the first publication of said notice the board of supervisors shall have acquired power to proceed with such hearing. Said notice shall state the fact of the filing of said report and shall contain (a) a general description of the location and extent of the work or improvement sufficient to identify the same; (b) a description of the district benefited by said work or improvement as contained in said report; (c) either a statement that said report contains an assessment proposed to be levied on each separate parcel of land within said district to retire the bonds proposed to be issued and to pay the interest thereon for each year during which said assessment shall continue, or a description of the zones, if any, into which such district is to be divided, and a statement of the percentage to be raised from the land in each of such zones each year for the payment of the installments of principal and interest on the bonds proposed to be issued; (d) a statement of the reasonable value of the work or improvement together with the incidental expenses of the original proceedings and the amount of interest, if any, upon said total; (e) the amount of the payments of principal or interest made upon the bonds previously issued, if any, and the credit or offset to be deducted in the issuance of such new bonds; (f) the total amount of the proposed new bond issue and a description of the bonds proposed to be issued, which bonds shall be as nearly as possible the same as to maturity, rate of interest, and other particulars as the bonds described in the original proceedings for said work or improvement, correcting any errors or irregularities, that may have existed in the bonds in said original proceedings.

(f) Said notice shall advise all persons interested that at the time fixed for the hearing of the report or at the time to which the hearing may be continued any person may appear and be heard upon any of the matters set forth in the report. The board of supervisors shall have power to confirm said report and to revise, correct, or modify the same in respect to any of the matters therein contained either as to the amount or character of the work or improvement done or the reasonable value thereof, the extent of the district to be benefited thereby, the amount of assessment levied upon any particular parcel of land within such district, the zones, if any, into which said district is divided, the percentages to be raised in each or any of said zones, the amount of deductions or offsets by reason of payments of principal or interest upon previously issued bonds, the amount of the bonds proposed to be issued, the maturity or rate of the interest thereon, or as to any other matter set forth in said report.

(g) At the conclusion of the hearing the board of supervisors shall adopt a resolution declaring its findings and determinations in the matter, which shall be final and conclusive upon all persons in all proceedings as to all matters so found and determined. If no changes are made in the matters set forth in said report it shall be sufficient in said resolution to declare that said report is confirmed and that bonds shall be issued as therein provided, but if any changes are made such changes shall be set forth and it may be declared that said report is confirmed as so modified by the changes set forth. The clerk of the board of supervisors shall transmit an attested copy of said resolution to the treasurer and upon receipt of the same the treasurer shall immediately proceed to issue the bonds as therein ordered, which said bonds shall be dated as of the date of the adoption of said resolution. Said bonds shall be issued and signed in all respects by the same officers and in the same manner and form as if issued pursuant to the provisions of Section 16 of Chapter 354 of the Statutes of 1919. Said bonds by their issuance shall be conclusive evidence of the regularity of all proceedings prior thereto under this act and after the same are issued no assessment or tax levied or collected for the purpose of paying the principal or interest on said bonds shall be held illegal or set aside or refunded by reason of any error, informality, irregularity, omission, or defect in any of the proceedings prior to the issuance of said bonds, nor shall any action or proceedings be thereafter commenced or maintained to cancel or set aside said bonds or prevent the payment thereof or the levy, collection or enforcement of any assessment or taxes for such payment.

(5) The information required under this subdivision shall be certified under penalty of perjury by the design-build entity and its general partners or joint venture members.

(b) At the close of the solicitation period, the district shall review the submissions. The district may evaluate submissions based solely upon the information provided in each design-build entity’s statement of qualifications. The district may also interview some or all of the design-build entities to further evaluate their qualifications for the project.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, upon issuance of a contract award, the district shall publicly announce its award, identifying the design-build entity to which the award is made, along with a statement regarding the basis of the award. The statement regarding the district’s contract award and the contract file shall provide sufficient information to satisfy an external audit.

(d) After selecting a design-build entity based on qualifications, the district may enter into a contract and direct the design-build entity to begin design and preconstruction activities sufficient to establish a guaranteed maximum price for the project.

(e) (1) Upon agreement of the guaranteed maximum price for the project, the district, at its sole and absolute discretion, may amend its contract with the design-build entity to contract for the remaining design, preconstruction, and construction activities sufficient to complete and close out the project, and will amend the contract to be consistent with the guaranteed maximum price. In the event that there are unforeseen site conditions or changes initiated at the request of the district, the guaranteed maximum price shall be modified if necessary.

(2) If the costs for completing all remaining design, preconstruction, and construction activities sufficient to complete and close out the project exceed the guaranteed maximum price, the costs exceeding the guaranteed maximum price shall be the responsibility of the design-build entity.

For purposes of this section, cost shall include the design-build entity’s direct costs, general conditions, overhead, and fee. 

(f) If the district and the design-build entity do not reach agreement on a guaranteed maximum price, or the district otherwise elects not to amend the design-build entity’s contract to complete the remaining work, the district may solicit proposals to complete the project from other firms that submitted statements of qualifications or requests for proposals. The district may also, upon written determination that it is in the best interest of the district to do so, formally solicit proposals from other design-build entities. 

(g) (1) The district, in each design-build request for qualifications, may identify specific types of subcontractors that shall be included in the design-build entity’s statement of qualifications. All construction subcontractors that are identified in the statement of qualifications shall be afforded the protections of Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 4100) of Part 1.

(2) Following award of the design-build contract, except for those construction subcontractors listed in the statement of qualifications, the design-build entity shall proceed as listed in this subdivision in awarding construction subcontracts with a value exceeding one-half of 1 percent of the contract price allocable to construction work.

(A) Provide public notice of availability of work to be subcontracted in accordance with the publication requirements applicable to the competitive bidding process of the district, including a fixed date and time on which qualifications statements, bids, or proposals will be due.

##### CHAPTER 3. Acquisition of Electronic Data Processing [22101 - 22109]  

######### 22101.  
The Legislature has found that electronic data-processing equipment, goods, and services are unique, and of such importance to state programs as to warrant a separate acquisition authority therefor. The Legislature finds that the Southern California Rapid Transit District has needs similar to the state with respect to acquisition of electronic data-processing goods and services.



######### 22102.  
For purposes of this chapter, “district” means the Southern California Rapid Transit District.



######### 22103.

(2) The goods and services are needed in case of an emergency where immediate acquisition is necessary for the efficient operation and preservation of the district’s services.

(b) The mode of acquisition to be used and the procedure to be followed shall be approved by the district which shall adopt appropriate criteria and procedures to ensure compliance with the intent of this chapter.  However, the procedure shall provide for issuance by the district of a solicitation document to, and for the submission of proposals by, prospective contractors.



######### 22104.  
(a) Contract awards shall be based on the proposal which provides the most cost-effective solution to the district’s requirements, as determined by the evaluation criteria contained in the solicitation document.  The evaluation procedures may provide for the selection of a vendor on a basis other than cost alone.

(b) Evaluation of proposals for the purpose of determining contract award shall provide for consideration of a proposer’s best financing alternative unless the district determines that a particular financing alternative should not be considered.

(c) A vendor may be excluded from proposal processes, if the vendor’s performance with respect to a previously awarded contract has been determined unsatisfactory by the district, provided that the exclusion shall not exceed one year for any one determination of unsatisfactory performance and provided further that any excluded vendor may at any time during the exclusion be reinstated upon demonstration to the district’s satisfaction that the problems which resulted in his or her exclusion have been corrected.

(d) To the extent practical, the solicitation documents shall provide for a contract to be written to enable acquisition of additional items to avoid essentially redundant acquisition processes when it can be determined that it is economical to do so.



######### 22105.  
Protest procedures shall be provided to allow proposers an opportunity to formally protest any acquisition conducted in accordance with this chapter. Authority to protest may be limited to participating proposers. The procuring officer of the district, or the person designated by the procuring officer, is authorized to consider and decide on initial protests. A decision regarding an initial protest shall be final. If, prior to making an award, any proposer who submitted an offer files a protest with the district against awarding the contract or purchase order on the ground that his or her bid or proposal should have been selected in accordance with the selection criteria in the selection document, the contract or purchase order shall not be awarded until either the protest has been withdrawn or the district has made a final decision as to the action to be taken on the protest. A protestor, within 10 calendar days of filing a protest, shall file with the district a full and complete written statement specifying in detail the grounds of the protest and the facts in support thereof.



######### 22106.  
Electronic data-processing goods which are determined to be surplus to the district’s needs shall be disposed of in a manner best serving the interests of the district, which may include auction, sale, or transfer to other governmental entities.

(a) Price negotiation with respect to all acquisitions conducted under this chapter.

(b) System or equipment component performance or availability standards, including an assessment of the added cost to the district to receive contractual guarantee of a level of performance.

(c) Requirement of a bond or assessment of a cost penalty with respect to a contract or consideration of a contract offered by a vendor whose performance has been determined unsatisfactory by the district.



######### 22108.  
The district may adopt additional rules and regulations consistent with the provisions of this chapter.



######### 22109.  
Any contract for electronic data-processing goods and services, to be manufactured or performed by the contractor especially for the district and not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the contractor’s business, may provide for such terms and conditions as the district deems necessary to protect its interests including, but not limited to, progress payments as the work is performed, provided that at least 10 percent of the contract price is required to be withheld until final delivery and acceptance of the goods or services, and that the contractor is required to submit a performance bond of at least one-half the total payable under the contract.

(c) A local public entity may define the amount of this preference.



######### 22151.

(a) For purposes of this section, “contractor” includes, but is not limited to, a contractor performing a public works contract, as defined in Section 1101, and any person or entity that would qualify as a contractor under Section 6106.5.

(b) Provisions shall be included in any invitation for bid and in any contract documents to permit the substitution of securities for any moneys withheld by a public agency to ensure performance under a contract; however, substitution of securities provisions shall not be required in contracts in which there will be financing provided by the Farmers Home Administration of the United States Department of Agriculture pursuant to the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. Sec. 1921 et seq.), and where federal regulations or policies, or both, do not allow the substitution of securities. At the request and expense of the contractor, securities equivalent to the amount withheld shall be deposited with the public agency, or with a state or federally chartered bank in this state as the escrow agent, who shall then pay those moneys to the contractor. Upon satisfactory completion of the contract, the securities shall be returned to the contractor.

(c) Alternatively, the contractor may request and the owner shall make payment of retentions earned directly to the escrow agent at the expense of the contractor. At the expense of the contractor, the contractor may direct the investment of the payments into securities and the contractor shall receive the interest earned on the investments upon the same terms provided for in this section for securities deposited by the contractor. Upon satisfactory completion of the contract, the contractor shall receive from the escrow agent all securities, interest, and payments received by the escrow agent from the owner, pursuant to the terms of this section.

(d) Securities eligible for investment under this section shall include those listed in Section 16430 of the Government Code, bank or savings and loan certificates of deposit, interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, standby letters of credit, or any other security mutually agreed to by the contractor and the public agency.

The contractor shall be the beneficial owner of any securities substituted for moneys withheld and shall receive any interest thereon.

Failure to include these provisions in bid and contract documents shall void any provisions for performance retentions in a public agency contract.

For purposes of this section, the term “public agency” shall include, but shall not be limited to, chartered cities.

(e) (1) Any contractor who elects to receive interest on moneys withheld in retention by a public agency shall, at the request of any subcontractor, make that option available to the subcontractor regarding any moneys withheld in retention by the contractor from the subcontractor. If the contractor elects to receive interest on any moneys withheld in retention by a public agency, then the subcontractor shall receive the identical rate of interest received by the contractor on any retention moneys withheld from the subcontractor by the contractor, less any actual pro rata costs associated with administering and calculating that interest. In the event that the interest rate is a fluctuating rate, the rate for the subcontractor shall be determined by calculating the interest rate paid during the time that retentions were withheld from the subcontractor. If the contractor elects to substitute securities in lieu of retention, then, by mutual consent of the contractor and subcontractor, the subcontractor may substitute securities in exchange for the release of moneys held in retention by the contractor.

(2) This subdivision shall apply only to those subcontractors performing more than five percent of the contractor’s total bid.

(3) No contractor shall require any subcontractor to waive any provision of this section.

(f) The Legislature hereby declares that the provisions of this section are of statewide concern and are necessary to encourage full participation by contractors and subcontractors in public contract procedures.

(g) The escrow agreement used hereunder shall be null, void, and unenforceable unless it is substantially similar to the following form:


|
ESCROW AGREEMENT FOR SECURITY DEPOSITS IN LIEU OF RETENTION
|
|
This Escrow Agreement is made and entered into by and be­tween

For the consideration hereinafter set forth, the Owner, Contractor, and Escrow Agent agree as follows:

(1) Pursuant to Section 22300 of the Public Contract Code of the State of California, Contractor has the option to deposit securities with Escrow Agent as a substitute for retention earnings required to be withheld by Owner pursuant to the Construction Contract entered into between the Owner and Contractor for ____ in the amount of ____ dated ____ (hereinafter referred to as the “Contract”). Alternatively, on written request of the Contractor, the Owner shall make payments of the retention earnings directly to the Escrow Agent. When the Contractor deposits the securities as a substitute for Contract earnings, the Escrow Agent shall notify the Owner within 10 days of the deposit. The market value of the securities at the time of the substitution shall be at least equal to the cash amount then required to be withheld as retention under the terms of the Contract between the Owner and Contractor. Securities shall be held in the name of ____, and shall designate the Contractor as the beneficial owner.

(2) The Owner shall make progress payments to the Contractor for those funds which otherwise would be withheld from progress payments pursuant to the Contract provisions, provided that the Escrow Agent holds securities in the form and amount specified above.

(3) When the Owner makes payment of retentions earned directly to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall hold them for the benefit of the Contractor until the time that the escrow created under this contract is terminated. The Contractor may direct the investment of the payments into securities. All terms and conditions of this agreement and the rights and responsibilities of the parties shall be equally applicable and binding when the Owner pays the Escrow Agent directly.

(4) Contractor shall be responsible for paying all fees for the expenses incurred by Escrow Agent in administering the Escrow Account and all expenses of the Owner. These expenses and payment terms shall be determined by the Owner, Contractor, and Escrow Agent.

(5) The interest earned on the securities or the money market accounts held in escrow and all interest earned on that interest shall be for the sole account of Contractor and shall be subject to withdrawal by Contractor at any time and from time to time without notice to the Owner.

(6) Contractor shall have the right to withdraw all or any part of the principal in the Escrow Account only by written notice to Escrow Agent accompanied by written authorization from the Owner to the Escrow Agent that Owner consents to the withdrawal of the amount sought to be withdrawn by Contractor.

(7) The Owner shall have a right to draw upon the securities in the event of default by the Contractor. Upon seven days’ written notice to the Escrow Agent from the owner of the default, the Escrow Agent shall immediately convert the securities to cash and shall distribute the cash as instructed by the Owner.

(8) Upon receipt of written notification from the Owner certifying that the Contract is final and complete, and that the Contractor has complied with all requirements and procedures applicable to the Contract, Escrow Agent shall release to Contractor all securities and interest on deposit less escrow fees and charges of the Escrow Account. The escrow shall be closed immediately upon disbursement of all moneys and securities on deposit and payments of fees and charges.

(9) Escrow Agent shall rely on the written notifications from the Owner and the Contractor pursuant to Sections (5) to (8), inclusive, of this Agreement and the Owner and Contractor shall hold Escrow Agent harmless from Escrow Agent’s release and disbursement of the securities and interest as set forth above.

(10) The names of the persons who are authorized to give written notice or to receive written notice on behalf of the Owner and on behalf of Contractor in connection with the foregoing, and exemplars of their respective signatures are as follows:
