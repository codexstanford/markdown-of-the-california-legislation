In those cases, removal of the benefit or recompense of the loss usually will be insufficient, by itself, to promote compliance with the applicable law, order, or written agreement. The penalty amount should reflect a remedial purpose and should provide a deterrent to future misconduct.

(15) Other factors as the commissioner may, in his or her opinion, consider relevant to assessing the penalty or establishing the amount of the penalty.

##### ARTICLE 3. Conservatorship of an Uninsured Licensee [640 - 652]  

######### 640.  
Whenever the commissioner deems it necessary in order to conserve the assets of any licensee that does not have federal deposit or share insurance for the benefit of the customers and other creditors, he or she may appoint a conservator of the licensee and require the conservator to post a bond as the commissioner deems proper. The conservator, under the direction of the commissioner, shall take possession of the books, records, and assets of every description of the licensee and take any action as the conservator may deem necessary to conserve the assets of the licensee pending further disposition of its business.



######### 641.  
A conservator appointed in accordance with Section 640 has all of the powers and rights with relation to the business and the property of the licensee for which he or she is appointed conservator as are possessed by the commissioner under this article with relation to a licensee of which the commissioner has taken possession, and the conservator is subject to the same obligations as are imposed upon the commissioner under this article. During the time that the conservator remains in possession of the licensee the rights of the licensee, and of all persons with respect thereto, subject to the other provisions of this article, are the same as if the commissioner had taken possession of the property and business of the licensee for the purposes of liquidation. All expenses of the conservatorship shall be paid out of the assets of the licensee and shall be a lien thereon which shall be prior to any other lien. The conservator shall receive a salary in an amount no greater than that which would be paid by the commissioner to a special deputy in charge of the liquidation of a licensee.



######### 642.  
The commissioner may order an examination at the earliest possible date of a licensee for which the commissioner has appointed a conservator.



######### 643.  
While any licensee is in the hands of a conservator, the commissioner may require the conservator to set aside and make available for withdrawal by customers and for payment to other creditors on a ratable basis such amounts as in the opinion of the commissioner may safely be used for that purpose.



######### 644.  
The commissioner, in his or her discretion, may permit the conservator to receive shares or deposits, but any shares or deposits received while the licensee is in the hands of a conservator shall be held as trust funds and shall not be subject to any limitation as to payment or withdrawal. The shares or deposits shall be segregated and shall not be used to liquidate any indebtedness of the licensee existing at the time the conservator was appointed or for the payment of any later indebtedness incurred for the purpose of liquidating any indebtedness of the licensee existing at the time the conservator was appointed. The shares or deposits shall be kept on hand in cash, invested in direct obligations of the United States, or deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank.



######### 645.  
If the commissioner is satisfied that it may be done safely and that it would be in the public interest, he or she may terminate a conservatorship and permit the licensee for whom a conservator was appointed to resume the transaction of its business under the direction of its board, subject to any terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations as the commissioner may prescribe.



######### 646.  
The conservator of a licensee that has been permitted to resume accepting member shares or deposits shall first cause a notice to be published in a newspaper of local circulation. The notice shall state the date on which the affairs of the licensee will be returned to its board and that the provisions of Section 644 will not be effective after 30 days from that date. The form of the notice and the newspaper in which the same is to be published shall be first approved by the commissioner. On the date of the publication of the notice, the conservator shall mail a copy of the notice to every person who made any deposit in the licensee after the date of the appointment of the conservator. The conservator shall address the copy of the notice to the persons who have made the deposits at the addresses appearing upon the books of the licensee. The conservator shall also mail a similar notice to every person making a deposit in the licensee after the date of the publication of the notice and before the affairs of the licensee are returned to its board.



######### 647.  
The commissioner may assess and collect from all licensees for whom a conservator is appointed their ratable share of the costs incurred in the administration of this article.



######### 648.  
Any licensee that the commissioner has taken possession of pursuant to Section 592, and for which a conservator has been appointed pursuant to this article, may be reorganized under a plan that requires the consent of any of the following:

(a) Customers and other creditors of the licensee representing at least 75 percent in amount of its total member shares or deposits and other liabilities as shown by the books of the licensee, excluding member shares or deposits and other liabilities which are to be satisfied in full under the provisions of the plan.

(b) Stockholders owning at least two-thirds of the outstanding stock as shown by the books of the licensee.

(c) Members of the licensee.

(d) Customers and other creditors of the licensee representing at least 75 percent in amount of its total shares or deposits and other liabilities as shown by the books of the licensee, excluding shares or deposits and other liabilities that are to be satisfied in full under the provisions of the plan, and, if applicable to the licensee, of stockholders owning at least two-thirds of its outstanding stock as shown by the books of the licensee.



######### 649.  
All customers, creditors, stockholders, if applicable, and other interested persons shall be given notice of any proposed plan of reorganization in the manner and at the times as the commissioner directs.



######### 650.  
No plan of reorganization shall become effective until the commissioner finds that the plan is fair and equitable to all customers, creditors, and stockholders, if applicable, and is in the public interest and until the commissioner approves the same in writing, subject to any conditions, restrictions, and limitations as the commissioner may prescribe.



######### 651.  
No creditor having security for the payment of his, her, or its claim shall be affected in his, her, or its right to enforce the security by the provisions of any plan for the reorganization of the licensee. Any plan of reorganization involving the reduction of claims of creditors shall apply only to that portion of a secured creditor’s loan that is not covered by the pledged security.



######### 652.  
When any plan of reorganization becomes effective, all books, records, and assets of the licensee shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the plan and the affairs of the licensee shall be conducted by its board in the manner provided by the plan and under the conditions, restrictions, and limitations that may have been prescribed by the commissioner. When any plan of reorganization adopted and approved as herein provided becomes effective, all customers and other creditors and, if applicable, stockholders of the licensee, whether or not they have consented to the plan of reorganization, shall be fully and in all respects subject to and bound by the plan’s provisions and the claims of all customers and other creditors shall be treated as if they had consented to the plan of reorganization.

If the principal sum thereof exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the commissioner may compromise, compound, or sell the debt upon those terms as the court may approve. If it appears improbable that a recovery on a debt can be had, and that the costs of an action to collect would be lost, and the principal sum thereof does not exceed five hundred dollars ($500), the commissioner may determine that no suit thereon shall be brought. If the principal sum of that debt exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the commissioner may determine that no suit thereon be brought after obtaining approval of the court.

(2) Succeed to the rights, obligations, properties, assets, investments, shares, deposits, demands, and agreements of the licensee whose business is sold under all trusts, executorships, administrations, guardianships, conservatorships, agencies, and other fiduciary or representative capacities, to the same extent as though the purchasing licensee had originally assumed, acquired, or owned the same, subject to the rights of trustors and beneficiaries under the trusts so sold to nominate another or succeeding trustee of the trust so sold after the sale.

(3) Succeed to and be entitled to take and execute the appointment to executorships, trusteeships, guardianships, conservatorships, and other fiduciary and representative capacities to which the licensee whose business is sold is or may be named in wills, whenever probated, or to which it is or may be named or appointed by any other instrument.

(e) For purposes of subdivision (d), any purchase and sale of the type referred to in subdivision (d) shall be deemed to be effective at the time provided in the agreement of the purchase and sale or in the order of the court approving the purchase and sale.



######### 673.  
Within six months after taking possession of the property and business of any licensee that does not have federal deposit or share insurance, the commissioner may terminate or adopt any executory contract to which the licensee may be a party, including leases of real or personal property. Claims for damages resulting from the termination of any contract or lease may be filed and allowed, but no claim of a landlord for damages resulting from the rejection of an unexpired lease of real property or under any covenant of the lease shall be allowed in an amount exceeding the rent reserved by the lease, without acceleration, for the year succeeding the date of the surrender of the premises plus the amount of any unpaid accrued rent without acceleration.

Any conveyance or other instrument executed by the commissioner pursuant to this authority shall be valid and effectual for all purposes as though the same had been executed by the officers of the licensee by authority of its board of directors. Whenever the commissioner sells any real property of the licensee a certified copy of the order of the court approving the sale shall be recorded in the county in which any part of the real property is located.

The commissioner shall make an inventory of the assets of the licensee in duplicate and file one in the office of the commissioner and one with the clerk of the county in which the head office of the licensee is located to be filed with the papers in the liquidation proceedings.

######### 680.  
All claims of every kind against the licensee or against any property owned or held by the licensee shall be presented to the commissioner in writing verified by the claimant or someone on his or her behalf within four months of the date of the first publication of the notice to creditors.

######### 686.  
All approved claims of customers and other creditors shall bear interest at the rate provided by law on judgments from the date that the commissioner takes possession of the property and business of the licensee.



######### 687.  
If the licensee has in its possession for safekeeping or storage any jewelry, plate, money, specie, bullion, stocks, bonds, securities, valuable papers, or other valuable personal property, or has rented any vaults, safes, or safe-deposit boxes, the commissioner shall cause to be mailed, by registered mail, postage prepaid, to any known person claiming to be or appearing on the books of the licensee to be the owner of the property or to the person in whose name the safe, vault, or box stands a notice notifying the person to remove all of the personal property within a specified fixed period of not less than 60 days.

The commissioner may cause any safe, vault, or box to be opened in his or her presence or in the presence of one of the special deputy commissioners and of a notary not an officer or employee of the licensee or of the commissioner. The contents thereof, if any, shall be sealed by the notary in a package upon which the notary shall distinctly mark the name and address of the person in whose name the safe or box stands upon the books of the licensee and shall attach thereon a list and a description of the property within the package. The package so sealed and addressed, together with the list and description may be kept by the commissioner in one or more of the safes or boxes of the licensee or elsewhere until delivered to the person whose name it bears or until otherwise disposed of as directed by the court.

##### ARTICLE 5. Disposal of Unclaimed Trust Property [700 - 702]  

######### 700.  
Whenever any licensee is being liquidated or whenever the trust business of any licensee has been discontinued and the licensee has in its possession money or other property held by it in trust or for safekeeping and the beneficiaries or persons entitled thereto are unknown or cannot be found, the commissioner or the licensee, upon obtaining approval of the superior court of the county in which the liquidation proceedings are pending or in which the head office of the licensee is situated, may do the following:

Any share or deposit or other sum that has not been paid to the person entitled thereto within six months after the licensee ceased to conduct a business shall be paid into the State Treasury. The deposits with the State Treasury shall be deemed to have been received under the provisions of Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 1500) of Title 10 of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure and shall be subject to claim or other disposition as provided in that chapter. If the commissioner has reason to conclude that the liquidation of the licensee is not being safely or expeditiously conducted, he or she may take possession of the business and property of the licensee in the same manner and with the same effect and subject to the same rights accorded the licensee as if he or she had taken possession pursuant to Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 600), and he or she may proceed to liquidate the licensee’s affairs in the same manner as provided in that article. When the licensee has been completely liquidated, its corporate existence shall be dissolved in the manner provided by law.



######### 721.  
If the licensee referred to in Section 720 is a state-chartered credit union and the commissioner has taken possession of the business and property of the credit union, the commissioner may appoint a liquidating agent or a liquidating committee of three members of the credit union to liquidate the business and assets of the credit union in the manner provided in Article 2 (commencing with Section 15250) of Chapter 9 of Division 5, except that, in lieu of the certificate required under Section 15252, the commissioner shall prepare and file in the office of the Secretary of State a certificate of commencement of liquidation proceedings upon taking possession of the business and assets, and the commissioner or his or her authorized deputy shall countersign the certificate referred to in Sections 15257 and 15258 whenever liquidation is involuntary. The commissioner may, however, prepare and file a final certificate whenever he or she retains possession of the assets of any credit union for the purpose of liquidation. The liquidating agent need not be a member of the credit union to be liquidated and may be a person, firm, or corporation, as determined by the commissioner.

Whenever the commissioner determines that an extraordinary situation exists anywhere in this state the commissioner may, by proclamation, authorize banks located in the affected area or areas to close any or all of their offices. The office or offices so closed shall remain closed until the commissioner proclaims that the extraordinary situation has ended or until such earlier time as the officers of the bank determine that one or more closed offices should reopen and in either event for such further time thereafter as may reasonably be required to reopen.



######### 1093.  
(a) Whenever the officers of a bank are of the opinion that an extraordinary situation exists which affects or may affect one or more of a bank’s offices, they shall have the authority in the reasonable and proper exercise of their discretion to determine not to open such offices on any business or banking day, or, if such offices have opened to close one or more of them during the continuation of such extraordinary situation even if the commissioner has not issued and does not issue a proclamation of extraordinary situation. The office or offices so closed shall remain closed until such time as the officers determine with respect to each such office that the extraordinary situation has ended and for such further time thereafter as may reasonably be required to be reopened; however, in no case shall such office or offices remain closed for more than 48 consecutive hours excluding other legal holidays without requesting the approval of the commissioner nor, in case such request is denied by the commissioner, for more than 24 consecutive hours excluding other legal holidays after such denial.

##### CHAPTER 7. Acquisition of Control [1250 - 1263]  

######### 1250.  
Unless the context otherwise requires, in this chapter:

(a) “Bank” means a bank organized under the laws of this state.

(b) “Control” means possession, direct or indirect, of the power:

(1) To vote 25 percent or more of any class of the voting securities issued by a person; or

(2) To direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract (other than a commercial contract for goods or nonmanagement services), or otherwise; provided, however, that no individual shall be deemed to control a person solely on account of being a director, officer, or employee of such person.

For purposes of paragraph (2) of this subdivision, a person who, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 10 percent or more of the then outstanding voting securities issued by another person is presumed to control such other person.

For purposes of this chapter, the commissioner may determine whether a person in fact controls another person.

(c) “Controlling person” means a person who, directly or indirectly, controls a bank.

(d) “Person” means an individual, a corporation, an association, a syndicate, a partnership, a limited liability company, a business trust, an estate, a trust, or an organization of any kind, or any combination of any of the foregoing acting in concert.

(a) Make a tender offer for, a request or invitation for tenders of, or an offer to exchange securities for, any voting security or any security convertible into a voting security of a bank or a controlling person if the person making such tender offer, request or invitation for tenders, or offer to exchange securities would, by consummation thereof, directly or indirectly, acquire control of such bank or such controlling person.

(b) Solicit approval of any shareholder of a controlling person for a merger, consolidation, sale of assets, or other transaction by which any person other than such controlling person would acquire control of the bank controlled by such controlling person.

(c) Acquire control of a bank or a controlling person; provided, however, that nothing in this subdivision shall be deemed to prohibit any person from negotiating to acquire (but not acquiring) control of a bank or a controlling person.



######### 1252.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, except for those persons approved by the commissioner prior to September 1, 2002, and for those persons who control industrial banks as of September 1, 2002, no person may directly or indirectly, including through any merger, consolidation, or any other type of business combination, acquire control of an industrial bank, as defined in Section 111, unless the person is engaged only in the activities permitted for financial holding companies, as provided in Section 103 of the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. Sec. 1843(k)(1)), or is a credit union, as defined in Section 165, when the industrial bank is a credit union service organization, as defined in Section 14651. Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt a person seeking to acquire control of a bank that otherwise qualifies to do so pursuant to this section, from the requirements of Sections 1250 to 1263, inclusive. For the purposes of this section, the term “control” has the same meaning as in subdivision (b) of Section 1250.



######### 1253.

(a) In case the applicant has been a director or officer of the bank for not less than two years (or, if the bank has been in business for less than two years, for such lesser period), a fee of five hundred dollars ($500); and

(b) In any other case, a fee of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500).



######### 1254.  
If the commissioner finds, with respect to the proposed acquisition of control of a bank or a controlling person, that any of the factors set forth in subdivisions (a) to (g), inclusive, is true, he or she shall deny the application. If the commissioner finds that none of such factors is true, he or she shall approve the application.

(a) That the proposed acquisition of control would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of this state;

(b) That the effect of the proposed acquisition of control in any section of the state may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly or that the proposed acquisition of control would in any other manner be in restraint of trade, and that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed acquisition of control are not clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served;

(c) That the financial condition of any acquiring person is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the bank or the controlling person, or prejudice the interests of the depositors, creditors, or shareholders of the bank or the controlling person;

(1) That the integrity of an acquiring person indicates that it would not be in the interest of the depositors, creditors, or shareholders of a bank or controlling person or in the interest of the public to permit the acquiring person to control the bank or controlling person if the acquiring person or any director or officer of the acquiring person has been convicted of, or has pleaded nolo contendere to, any crime involving fraud or dishonesty.

(2) That a plan to make a major change in the management of a bank or controlling person is not fair and reasonable to the depositors, creditors, or shareholders of the bank or controlling person if the plan provides for a person who has been convicted of, or has pleaded nolo contendere to, any crime involving fraud or dishonesty to become a director or officer of the bank or controlling person.

(b) Subdivision (a) shall not be deemed to be the only grounds upon which the commissioner may find, for purposes of Section 1254, that the integrity of an acquiring person indicates that it would not be in the interest of the depositors, creditors, or shareholders of a bank or controlling person or in the interest of the public to permit the acquiring person to control the bank or controlling person or that a plan to make a major change in the management of a bank or controlling person is not fair and reasonable to the depositors, creditors, or shareholders of the bank or controlling person.

No domestic or foreign corporation or the registrar or transfer agent of any such corporation shall be liable for registering or causing to be registered on the books of such corporation any share or shares or other securities in the name of any nominee of such trust company or for transferring or causing to be transferred on the books of any such corporation any share or shares or other securities theretofore registered by such corporation in the name of any nominee of such trust company as herein provided when the transfer is made upon the authorization of such nominee.

Any trust company may as such fiduciary or cofiduciary invest funds which it lawfully holds for investment in interests in common trust funds administered by itself or by any affiliated trust company including, without limitation, any foreign (other state) affiliated trust company, if such investment is not prohibited by the instrument, judgment, decree, order, or statute creating or governing such fiduciary relationship, and if, in the case of cofiduciaries, the trust company procures the consent of its cofiduciaries to such investment.

(c) Each common trust fund established hereunder shall be treated as an entity separate and distinct from the fiduciary relationships participating therein.

No participating fiduciary relationship, nor any person having an interest in that relationship, shall have or be deemed to have any ownership in any particular property of the common trust fund, but each participating fiduciary relationship shall have a proportionate undivided interest in the fund and its income, and the ownership of all property of the common trust fund shall be in the trustee of the fund.

(d) This section shall apply to fiduciary relationships now in existence or hereafter established, whether the same be revocable or irrevocable. The commissioner, at his or her direction, may make an examination of any common trust fund established hereunder at the times and to the extent as he or she may deem advisable. The provisions of the Corporate Securities Law shall not apply to the creation, administration, or termination of common trust funds, nor to participation therein.



######### 1586.  
With regard to any participation certificates heretofore issued by any trust company, secured by a trust deed or mortgage, the full legal title in the deed or mortgage and debt (referred to in this section as “security”) shall be held by the trust company issuing the certificates as trustee of an express trust, with all powers necessary to extend, renew, enforce, collect, and liquidate the same, acquire title to the property covered thereby either through foreclosure or by voluntary conveyance; manage, lease, sell (either for cash or upon deferred payments), exchange, or otherwise realize upon the security or property and distribute the net proceeds thereof. All sums so realized shall, as and when received by such trustee, after payment of its compensation and all costs, charges, and expenses, including brokers’ commissions and advances for taxes and assessments, incurred or made in connection with the protection, administration, and liquidation of the security or property, be distributed to the trusts or persons who are beneficiaries of the trust, as their interests may appear therein. The rights and interests therein of any such beneficiary failing to contribute on demand its or his pro rata of sums advanced, expended, or required by the trust company in the protection, administration, or liquidation of the trust shall be subject to a lien for all sums, with legal interest thereon advanced, expended, or required for any of such purposes by the trustee or by any other beneficiary of the trust.

The trust in such security or property shall continue in the trust company so long as any of the certificates are outstanding, irrespective of any distribution of the certificates from the trust in which the same are held.

The purpose of this section is to define and clarify the rights and obligations of trust companies and of all persons and trusts interested in participation certificates issued under any authority of law.

Any such trust company shall be liable for its failure to perform any of the duties required by law to be performed by an individual acting in like capacity and shall be subject to the same penalties for such failure as would be applicable to an individual.



######### 1608.  
Whenever any corporation desires to withdraw from and discontinue doing a trust business, it shall furnish to the commissioner satisfactory evidence of its release and discharge from all the obligations and trusts which it has assumed or which have been imposed on it by law. Thereupon the commissioner shall revoke his or her certificate of authority to do a trust business, and the State Treasurer shall return to it all of the securities deposited by it. Thereafter such corporation shall not be permitted to use and shall not use the word “trust” in its corporate name, or in connection with its business.

All such acts and proceedings done or taken prior to the revocation of its certificate of authority to do a trust business by the commissioner, under the provisions of this division, or the revocation by any court or judge thereof of the appointment, order, or decree theretofore entered in such trust matter, shall be as valid and effective for all purposes as if any such neglect or failure had not occurred.

######### 1611.  
A bank or trust company shall not mingle trust funds received by it with other assets of the corporation or association and such funds shall not be used in the conduct of its business except to the extent that such funds are deposited with the same corporation or association in accordance with the provisions of this division. Any officer of any bank or association who knowingly violates or consents to the violation of this section is guilty of a felony.



######### 1612.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any bank and any trust company holding securities in a fiduciary capacity or while engaged in a trust business, or while acting in any capacity under a court or private trust, or while acting in that capacity with one or more persons as cofiduciary or cofiduciaries, unless the instrument creating the trust contains a provision to the contrary, is authorized to deposit or arrange for the deposit of the securities in a securities depository, as defined in Section 30004, which is licensed under Section 30200 or exempted from licensing thereunder by Section 30005 or 30006. When securities are so deposited, they may be held in the custody of the securities depository in which they are deposited or in the custody of any other securities depository so licensed or exempted and in which the securities depository in which the securities were deposited maintains an account, or in the custody of any bank or trust company with authority to accept custody of the securities, that accepts custody of the securities on behalf of a securities depository. The securities may be held in the name of the nominee of the securities depository in which they are deposited, or in the name of the nominee of any other securities depository with which the securities depository in which they are deposited maintains an account. The custodian of securities so deposited may merge certificates representing securities of the same class of the same issuer and may hold those certificates in bulk with any other securities deposited in any securities depository by any person regardless of the ownership of the securities, and certificates of small denomination may be merged into one or more certificates of larger denomination. Any bank or trust company that deposits or arranges for the deposit of the securities in a securities depository shall maintain records that at all times show the ownership of the deposited securities. A bank or trust company depositing securities pursuant to this section shall be subject to such rules and regulations as in the case of state chartered institutions, the commissioner and, in the case of national banking associations, the Comptroller of the Currency may from time to time issue. This section shall apply to securities now held or hereafter held by a bank or trust company in the above designated capacities. A bank or trust company may, but shall not be required to, own capital stock of a securities depository in which it deposits securities pursuant to this section.



######### 1613.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any bank and any trust company holding securities in a fiduciary capacity or while engaged in a trust business, or while acting in any capacity under a court or private trust, or while acting in that capacity with one or more persons as cofiduciary or cofiduciaries, unless the instrument creating the trust contains a provision to the contrary, is authorized to deposit or arrange for the deposit with a federal reserve bank of any such securities the principal and interest of which the United States or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof has agreed to pay, or has guaranteed payment, to be credited to one or more accounts on the books of the federal reserve bank in the name of the bank or trust company, to be designated fiduciary or safekeeping accounts, to which accounts other similar securities may be credited. Any bank or trust company that deposits or arranges for the deposit of securities pursuant to this section shall maintain records that at all times show the ownership of the securities deposited. A bank or trust company depositing securities pursuant to this section shall be subject to such rules and regulations as in the case of state-chartered institutions, the commissioner and, in the case of national banking associations, the Comptroller of the Currency, may from time to time issue. Ownership of, and other interests in, the securities credited to such account may be transferred by entries on the books of the federal reserve bank without physical delivery of any securities. A bank or trust company acting as custodian for a fiduciary shall, on demand by the fiduciary, certify in writing to the fiduciary the securities deposited by the bank or trust company pursuant to this section for the account of the fiduciary. A fiduciary shall, on demand by any party to its accounting, certify in writing to that party the securities deposited for its account as a fiduciary pursuant to this section. This section shall apply to all fiduciaries and custodians for fiduciaries, acting on the effective date of this section or who thereafter may act regardless of the state of the instrument or court order by which they are appointed.

##### ARTICLE 2. Remedies for Nonpayment of Rent [1630 - 1651]  

######### 1630.  
Every bank conducting a safe-deposit business shall be entitled to the special remedies set forth in this article in enforcing the liabilities of safe-deposit box renters and of safekeeping and storage depositors.



######### 1631.  
If the rental of any safe-deposit box is not paid within six months from the day it is due, the bank, or at any time thereafter and while such rental remains unpaid, may mail a notice to the person in whose name such box stands on its records stating that if the amount due for such rental is not paid on or before a specified day, which must be at least 30 days after the date of mailing such notice, the bank will cause such box to be forced open.



######### 1632.  
At any time after the date specified in such notice, if the rental for such safe-deposit box to the date of payment and the cost of giving such notice have not been paid, the bank, in the presence of two of its employees, one of whom shall be an officer of the bank, may cause such box to be opened and the contents thereof to be removed and inventoried. The inventory shall be signed by such persons.

All contents removed from a safe-deposit box pursuant to Section 1632 shall be retained by the bank for at least two years unless sooner delivered to or on the order of the person in whose name such box stood on the records of the bank. The bank shall deliver the contents of such box to or on the order of the person in whose name such box stood on its records, upon payment to it before such contents are sold or destroyed, of all rental due at the time of opening the box, the cost of giving notice, the charges for opening the box and for custody of the contents, and any other proper charges. The bank may deliver such contents on the order of the person in whose name such box stood on its records, irrespective of any information disclosed by the contents indicating ownership thereof by any other person.



######### 1635.  
At any time after two years from the day when a safe-deposit box has been opened pursuant to this article, the bank may mail a notice to the person in whose name such box stood on its records, stating that unless the amounts due to the bank for rental, for the cost of mailing and publishing notice of sale, and for its charges for opening the box and for custody of its contents, and any other proper charges, giving the total amount thereof, are paid, the bank will offer for sale the contents thereof at a time and place named in such notice, which time shall be at least 30 days after the mailing thereof.

######### 1637.  
Upon the making of a sale of any securities, an officer of the bank shall execute and attach to the securities so sold an affidavit reciting facts showing that such securities were sold pursuant to this article and that the provisions of this article governing such sale have been complied with. The affidavit shall be and constitute sufficient authority to any corporation whose stock is so sold or to any registrar or transfer agent of such corporation to cancel the certificates of stock so sold and to issue a new certificate or certificates representing such stock to the purchaser thereof, and to any registrar, trustee, or transfer agent of registered bonds or other securities, to register any such bonds or other securities in the name of the purchaser thereof.



######### 1638.  
From the proceeds of any sale the bank shall deduct the amount set forth in such notice and any further charges which may have accrued since the mailing of the notice and shall record the balance of the proceeds, if any, on its books as a liability payable to the person in whose name the safe-deposit box was rented.

At any time thereafter, unless sooner delivered to or on the order of the person in whose name the box stood on the records of the bank, the documents, letters, and articles and also those contents which have been offered for sale and for which no purchaser has been found, may be destroyed in the presence of an officer of the bank, but if no notice of intended sale of the contents of the box has been given pursuant to Section 1635, the bank shall mail a notice of its intention to destroy the documents, letters, and articles at least 30 days before the destruction of the same to the person in whose name the box stood on the records of the bank.



######### 1640.  
If, before the effective date of this section, a bank or its predecessor in interest, has caused a safe-deposit box to be opened for nonpayment of rental, and the contents of such box or any part thereof remain in its custody, it shall be entitled to the special remedies in enforcing the liability of the former renter of such box as set forth in Sections 1634 to 1639, inclusive, whether or not such box was rented prior to October 1, 1949.



######### 1641.  
Whenever a bank receives personal property for safekeeping or storage as bailee and issues a receipt therefor, the bank may enforce its lien as warehouseman in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code or at its option in the manner provided in Sections 1671 to 1673, inclusive, of this article.

If the amount specified in such notice and all other charges of the bank and expenses of mailing and publishing notice of sale accruing to time of payment are not paid, the bank may sell all or any portion of such personal property at public sale at the time and place given in such notice. Notice of the time and place of sale shall be published once at least five days before the date of sale in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the sale is to be held, or if no such newspaper is published in the county such notice shall be posted in three public places in the county at least five days before the date of sale. Such sale may be postponed from time to time by public pronouncement at the time and place of sale. The bank may include in the notice required to be mailed a statement to the effect that if the amount due at that time is not paid at least 10 days before the date set for the sale, it may cause any container in which any of such personal property may be, to be opened and the contents thereof to be sold at the time and place fixed for the sale with or without such container, or the container may be sold without the contents. If such statement is included in the notice, the bank, at any time within 10 days before the date fixed for the sale, may open any such container and remove the contents in the presence of two employees of the bank, one of whom shall be an officer thereof, both of whom shall make and sign an inventory of the contents. Thereafter, on the day fixed for the sale, the contents may be sold as a whole or separately and with or without the container, or the container may be sold without the contents.



######### 1643.  
From the proceeds of the sale, the bank shall deduct all charges as stated in the final notice, together with any further charges that have accrued since the mailing thereof, and reasonable expenses for notices, advertising, and sale, and shall credit the balance of the proceeds, if any, to an account in the name of the person in whose name the receipt for such personal property was issued.

At any time thereafter, unless sooner delivered to or on the order of the person in whose name the receipt was issued, the documents, letters and articles may be destroyed in the presence of an officer of the bank and of a notary public.



######### 1645.  
The power conferred on a bank to sell the contents of a safe-deposit box or personal property received for safekeeping or storage for nonpayment of rental or other charges, includes power to sell any bonds, stock certificates, promissory notes, choses in action, or other securities, and any other tangible or intangible property found in such box or in the container in which such personal property was received for safekeeping or storage, regardless of whether it appears from such securities or property that the person in whose name the box stood or to whom the safekeeping or storage receipt was issued, possesses title to any interest in such securities or other property or power to transfer such title or interest.



######### 1646.  
A bank holding a safe-deposit box originally rented from, or personal property against which a safekeeping or storage receipt was issued by, a predecessor in interest, or a bank holding the contents of such box, shall be entitled to the remedies as to such box or the contents thereof or as to the safekeeping or storage of such property in like manner and to the same extent as if such box had been rented from or such safekeeping or storage of personal property had been received by such bank in the first instance.



######### 1647.  
The provisions of this article do not preclude any other remedy by action or otherwise now or hereafter existing for the enforcement of the claims of a bank against the person in whose name the safe-deposit box stood or stands, or in whose name the safekeeping or storage receipt was issued, nor bar the right of a bank to so recover, at its option, either the entire amount of the debt due to it without recourse to sale of the property, if any, or so much of the debt due to it as shall not have been paid by the proceeds of the sale of all or any portion of the property deposited with it.

##### DIVISION 1.4. CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT [4050 - 4060]  

######### 4050.  
This division shall be known and may be cited as the California Financial Information Privacy Act.



######### 4051.  
(a) The Legislature intends for financial institutions to provide their consumers notice and meaningful choice about how consumers’ nonpublic personal information is shared or sold by their financial institutions.

(b) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting the California Financial Information Privacy Act to afford persons greater privacy protections than those provided in Public Law 106-102, the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and that this division be interpreted to be consistent with that purpose.



######### 4051.5.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(1) The California Constitution protects the privacy of California citizens from unwarranted intrusions into their private and personal lives.

(2) Federal banking legislation, known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which breaks down restrictions on affiliation among different types of financial institutions, increases the likelihood that the personal financial information of California residents will be widely shared among, between, and within companies.

(3) The policies intended to protect financial privacy imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act are inadequate to meet the privacy concerns of California residents.

(4) Because of the limitations of these federal policies, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act explicitly permits states to enact privacy protections that are stronger than those provided in federal law.

(b) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this division:

(1) To ensure that Californians have the ability to control the disclosure of what the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act calls nonpublic personal information.

(2) To achieve that control for California consumers by requiring that financial institutions that want to share information with third parties and unrelated companies seek and acquire the affirmative consent of California consumers prior to sharing the information.

(3) To further achieve that control for California consumers by providing consumers with the ability to prevent the sharing of financial information among affiliated companies through a simple opt-out mechanism via a clear and understandable notice provided to the consumer.

(4) To provide, to the maximum extent possible, consistent with the purposes cited above, a level playing field among types and sizes of businesses consistent with the objective of providing consumers control over their nonpublic personal information, including providing that those financial institutions with limited affiliate relationships may enter into agreements with other financial institutions as provided in this division, and providing that the different business models of differing financial institutions are treated in ways that provide consistent consumer control over information-sharing practices.

(5) To adopt to the maximum extent feasible, consistent with the purposes cited above, definitions consistent with federal law, so that in particular there is no change in the ability of businesses to carry out normal processes of commerce for transactions voluntarily entered into by consumers.



######### 4052.  
For the purposes of this division:

(a) “Nonpublic personal information” means personally identifiable financial information (1) provided by a consumer to a financial institution, (2) resulting from any transaction with the consumer or any service performed for the consumer, or (3) otherwise obtained by the financial institution.

Nonpublic personal information shall include any list, description, or other grouping of consumers, and publicly available information pertaining to them, that is derived using any nonpublic personal information other than publicly available information, but shall not include any list, description, or other grouping of consumers, and publicly available information pertaining to them, that is derived without using any nonpublic personal information.

(6) Any personally identifiable financial information collected through an Internet cookie or an information collecting device from a Web server.

(7) Information from a consumer report.

(c) “Financial institution” means any institution the business of which is engaging in financial activities as described in Section 1843(k) of Title 12 of the United States Code and doing business in this state. An institution that is not significantly engaged in financial activities is not a financial institution. The term “financial institution” does not include any institution that is primarily engaged in providing hardware, software, or interactive services, provided that it does not act as a debt collector, as defined in 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1692a, or engage in activities for which the institution is required to acquire a charter, license, or registration from a state or federal governmental banking, insurance, or securities agency. The term “financial institution” does not include the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation or any entity chartered and operating under the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (12 U.S.C.

The term “financial institution” does not include institutions chartered by Congress specifically to engage in a proposed or actual securitization, secondary market sale, including sales of servicing rights, or similar transactions related to a transaction of the consumer, as long as those institutions do not sell or transfer nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. The term “financial institution” does not include any provider of professional services, or any wholly owned affiliate thereof, that is prohibited by rules of professional ethics and applicable law from voluntarily disclosing confidential client information without the consent of the client. The term “financial institution” does not include any person licensed as a dealer under Article 1 (commencing with Section 11700) of Chapter 4 of Division 5 of the Vehicle Code that enters into contracts for the installment sale or lease of motor vehicles pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 2B (commencing with Section 2981) or 2D (commencing with Section 2985.7) of Title 14 of Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code and assigns substantially all of those contracts to financial institutions within 30 days.

(d) “Affiliate” means any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, another entity, but does not include a joint employee of the entity and the affiliate. A franchisor, including any affiliate thereof, shall be deemed an affiliate of the franchisee for purposes of this division.

(f) “Consumer” means an individual resident of this state, or that individual’s legal representative, who obtains or has obtained from a financial institution a financial product or service to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. For purposes of this division, an individual resident of this state is someone whose last known mailing address, other than an Armed Forces Post Office or Fleet Post Office address, as shown in the records of the financial institution, is located in this state. For purposes of this division, an individual is not a consumer of a financial institution solely because he or she is (1) a participant or beneficiary of an employee benefit plan that a financial institution administers or sponsors, or for which the financial institution acts as a trustee, insurer, or fiduciary, (2) covered under a group or blanket insurance policy or group annuity contract issued by the financial institution, (3) a beneficiary in a workers’ compensation plan, (4) a beneficiary of a trust for which the financial institution is a trustee, or (5) a person who has designated the financial institution as trustee for a trust, provided that the financial institution provides all required notices and rights required by this division to the plan sponsor, group or blanket insurance policyholder, or group annuity contractholder.

However, for purposes of the application of the definition of control as it relates to credit unions, a credit union has a controlling influence over the management or policies of a credit union service organization (CUSO), as that term is defined by state or federal law or regulation, if the CUSO is at least 67 percent owned by credit unions. For purposes of the application of the definition of control to a financial institution subject to regulation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, a person who owns beneficially, either directly or through one or more controlled companies, more than 25 percent of the voting securities of a company is presumed to control the company, and a person who does not own more than 25 percent of the voting securities of a company is presumed not to control the company, and a presumption regarding control may be rebutted by evidence, but in the case of an investment company, the presumption shall continue until the United States Securities and Exchange Commission makes a decision to the contrary according to the procedures described in Section 2(a)(9) of the federal Investment Company Act of 1940.

(h) “Necessary to effect, administer, or enforce” means the following:

(1) The disclosure is required, or is a usual, appropriate, or acceptable method to carry out the transaction or the product or service business of which the transaction is a part, and record or service or maintain the consumer’s account in the ordinary course of providing the financial service or financial product, or to administer or service benefits or claims relating to the transaction or the product or service business of which it is a part, and includes the following:

(D) The form, statement, or writing clearly and conspicuously discloses (i) that the consent will remain in effect until revoked or modified by the consumer; (ii) that the consumer may revoke the consent at any time; and (iii) the procedure for the consumer to revoke consent.

(E) The form, statement, or writing clearly and conspicuously informs the consumer that (i) the financial institution will maintain the document or a true and correct copy; (ii) the consumer is entitled to a copy of the document upon request; and (iii) the consumer may want to make a copy of the document for the consumer’s records.

(b) (1) A financial institution shall not disclose to, or share a consumer’s nonpublic personal information with, an affiliate unless the financial institution has clearly and conspicuously notified the consumer annually in writing pursuant to subdivision (d) that the nonpublic personal information may be disclosed to an affiliate of the financial institution and the consumer has not directed that the nonpublic personal information not be disclosed. A financial institution does not disclose information to, or share information with, its affiliate merely because information is maintained in common information systems or databases, and employees of the financial institution and its affiliate have access to those common information systems or databases, or a consumer accesses a Web site jointly operated or maintained under a common name by or on behalf of the financial institution and its affiliate, provided that where a consumer has exercised his or her right to prohibit disclosure pursuant to this division, nonpublic personal information is not further disclosed or used by an affiliate except as permitted by this division.

(2) Subdivision (a) shall not prohibit the release of nonpublic personal information by a financial institution with whom the consumer has a relationship to a nonaffiliated financial institution for purposes of jointly offering a financial product or financial service pursuant to a written agreement with the financial institution that receives the nonpublic personal information provided that all of the following requirements are met:

(A) The financial product or service offered is a product or service of, and is provided by, at least one of the financial institutions that is a party to the written agreement.

(C) The written agreement provides that the financial institution that receives that nonpublic personal information is required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and is prohibited from disclosing or using the information other than to carry out the joint offering or servicing of a financial product or financial service that is the subject of the written agreement.

(D) The financial institution that releases the nonpublic personal information has complied with subdivision (d) and the consumer has not directed that the nonpublic personal information not be disclosed.

(E) Notwithstanding this section, until January 1, 2005, a financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated financial institution pursuant to a preexisting contract with the nonaffiliated financial institution, for purposes of offering a financial product or financial service, if that contract was entered into on or before January 1, 2004.

(3) Nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit a financial institution from disclosing or sharing nonpublic personal information as otherwise specifically permitted by this division.

(4) A financial institution shall not discriminate against or deny an otherwise qualified consumer a financial product or a financial service because the consumer has directed pursuant to this subdivision that nonpublic personal information pertaining to him or her not be disclosed. A financial institution shall not be required to offer or provide products or services offered through affiliated entities or jointly with nonaffiliated financial institutions pursuant to paragraph (2) where the consumer has directed that nonpublic personal information not be disclosed pursuant to this subdivision and the financial institution could not offer or provide the products or services to the consumer without disclosure of the consumer’s nonpublic personal information that the consumer has directed not be disclosed pursuant to this subdivision.

Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit a financial institution from offering incentives or discounts to elicit a specific response to the notice set forth in this division. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the disclosure of nonpublic personal information allowed by Section 4056.

(5) The financial institution may, at its option, choose instead to comply with the requirements of subdivision (a).

(c) Nothing in this division shall restrict or prohibit the sharing of nonpublic personal information between a financial institution and its wholly owned financial institution subsidiaries; among financial institutions that are each wholly owned by the same financial institution; among financial institutions that are wholly owned by the same holding company; or among the insurance and management entities of a single insurance holding company system consisting of one or more reciprocal insurance exchanges which has a single corporation or its wholly owned subsidiaries providing management services to the reciprocal insurance exchanges, provided that in each case all of the following requirements are met:

(1) The financial institution disclosing the nonpublic personal information and the financial institution receiving it are regulated by the same functional regulator; provided, however, that for purposes of this subdivision, financial institutions regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, National Credit Union Administration, or a state regulator of depository institutions shall be deemed to be regulated by the same functional regulator; financial institutions regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the United States Department of Labor, or a state securities regulator shall be deemed to be regulated by the same functional regulator; and insurers admitted in this state to transact insurance and licensed to write insurance policies shall be deemed to be in compliance with this paragraph.

(2) The financial institution disclosing the nonpublic personal information and the financial institution receiving it are both principally engaged in the same line of business. For purposes of this subdivision, “same line of business” shall be one and only one of the following:

(d) (1) A financial institution shall be conclusively presumed to have satisfied the notice requirements of subdivision (b) if it uses the form set forth in this subdivision. The form set forth in this subdivision or a form that complies with subparagraphs (A) to (L), inclusive, of this paragraph shall be sent by the financial institution to the consumer so that the consumer may make a decision and provide direction to the financial institution regarding the sharing of his or her nonpublic personal information. If a financial institution does not use the form set forth in this subdivision, the financial institution shall use a form that meets all of the following requirements:

(A) The form uses the same title (“IMPORTANT PRIVACY CHOICES FOR CONSUMERS”) and the headers, if applicable, as follows: “Restrict Information Sharing With Companies We Own Or Control (Affiliates)” and “Restrict Information Sharing With Other Companies We Do Business With To Provide Financial Products And Services.”

(B) The titles and headers in the form are clearly and conspicuously displayed, and no text in the form is smaller than 10-point type.

(C) The form is a separate document, except as provided by subparagraph (D) of paragraph (2), and Sections 4054 and 4058.7.

(D) The choice or choices pursuant to subdivision (b) and Section 4054.6, if applicable, provided in the form are stated separately and may be selected by checking a box.

(E) The form is designed to call attention to the nature and significance of the information in the document.

(K) The form provides wide margins, ample line spacing and uses boldface or italics for key words.

(L) The form is not more than one page.

(2) (A) None of the instructional items appearing in brackets in the form set forth in this subdivision shall appear in the form provided to the consumer, as those items are for explanation purposes only. If a financial institution does not disclose or share nonpublic personal information as described in a header of the form, the financial institution may omit the applicable header or headers, and the accompanying information and box, in the form it provides pursuant to this subdivision. The form with those omissions shall be conclusively presumed to satisfy the notice requirements of this subdivision.

 NOTICE OF INCOMPLETE TEXT: The Important Privacy Choices  for Consumers form appears in the hard-copy publication of the  chaptered bill. See Sec. 8, Chapter 444 (p. 15), Statutes of 2013.

(B) If a financial institution uses a form other than that set forth in this subdivision, the financial institution may submit that form to its functional regulator for approval, and for forms filed with the Office of Privacy Protection prior to July 1, 2007, that approval shall constitute a rebuttable presumption that the form complies with this section.

(C) A financial institution shall not be in violation of this subdivision solely because it includes in the form one or more brief examples or explanations of the purpose or purposes, or context, within which information will be shared, as long as those examples meet the clarity and readability standards set forth in paragraph (1).

(D) The outside of the envelope in which the form is sent to the consumer shall clearly state in 16-point boldface type “IMPORTANT PRIVACY CHOICES,” except that a financial institution sending the form to a consumer in the same envelope as a bill, account statement, or application requested by the consumer does not have to include the wording “IMPORTANT PRIVACY CHOICES” on that envelope. The form shall be sent in any of the following ways:

(i) With a bill, other statement of account, or application requested by the consumer, in which case the information required by Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act may also be included in the same envelope.

(ii) As a separate notice or with the information required by Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and including only information related to privacy.

(iii) With any other mailing, in which case it shall be the first page of the mailing.

(E) If a financial institution uses a form other than that set forth in this subdivision, that form shall be filed with the Office of Privacy Protection within 30 days after it is first used.

(3) The consumer shall be provided a reasonable opportunity prior to disclosure of nonpublic personal information to direct that nonpublic personal information not be disclosed. A consumer may direct at any time that his or her nonpublic personal information not be disclosed. A financial institution shall comply with a consumer’s directions concerning the sharing of his or her nonpublic personal information within 45 days of receipt by the financial institution. When a consumer directs that nonpublic personal information not be disclosed, that direction is in effect until otherwise stated by the consumer. A financial institution that has not provided a consumer with annual notice pursuant to subdivision (b) shall provide the consumer with a form that meets the requirements of this subdivision, and shall allow 45 days to lapse from the date of providing the form in person or the postmark or other postal verification of mailing before disclosing nonpublic personal information pertaining to the consumer.

Nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit the disclosure of nonpublic personal information as allowed by subdivision (c) or Section 4056.

(5) If a financial institution does not have a continuing relationship with a consumer other than the initial transaction in which the product or service is provided, no annual disclosure requirement exists pursuant to this section as long as the financial institution provides the consumer with the form required by this section at the time of the initial transaction. As used in this section, “annually” means at least once in any period of 12 consecutive months during which that relationship exists. The financial institution may define the 12-consecutive-month period, but shall apply it to the consumer on a consistent basis. If, for example, a financial institution defines the 12-consecutive-month period as a calendar year and provides the annual notice to the consumer once in each calendar year, it complies with the requirement to send the notice annually.

(6) A financial institution with assets in excess of twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) shall include a self-addressed first class business reply return envelope with the notice. A financial institution with assets of up to and including twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) shall include a self-addressed return envelope with the notice. In lieu of the first class business reply return envelope required by this paragraph, a financial institution may offer a self-addressed return envelope with the notice and at least two alternative cost-free means for consumers to communicate their privacy choices, such as calling a toll-free number, sending a facsimile to a toll-free telephone number, or using electronic means. A financial institution shall clearly and conspicuously disclose in the form required by this subdivision the information necessary to direct the consumer on how to communicate his or her choices, including the toll-free or facsimile number or Web site address that may be used, if those means of communication are offered by the financial institution.

(7) A financial institution may provide a joint notice from it and one or more of its affiliates or other financial institutions, as identified in the notice, so long as the notice is accurate with respect to the financial institution and the affiliates and other financial institutions.

(e) Nothing in this division shall prohibit a financial institution from marketing its own products and services or the products and services of affiliates or nonaffiliated third parties to customers of the financial institution as long as (1) nonpublic personal information is not disclosed in connection with the delivery of the applicable marketing materials to those customers except as permitted by Section 4056 and (2) in cases in which the applicable nonaffiliated third party may extrapolate nonpublic personal information about the consumer responding to those marketing materials, the applicable nonaffiliated third party has signed a contract with the financial institution under the terms of which (A) the nonaffiliated third party is prohibited from using that information for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was provided, as set forth in the contract, and (B) the financial institution has the right by audit, inspections, or other means to verify the nonaffiliated third party’s compliance with that contract.



######### 4053.5.  
Except as otherwise provided in this division, an entity that receives nonpublic personal information from a financial institution under this division shall not disclose this information to any other entity, unless the disclosure would be lawful if made directly to the other entity by the financial institution.

(B) All other requirements applicable to the notice, as set forth in this division, are met, including, but not limited to, requirements concerning content, timing, form, and delivery. An electronic notice sent pursuant to this section is not required to include a return envelope.

(C) The notice is delivered to the consumer in a form the consumer may keep.

(2) A notice that is made available to a consumer, and is not delivered to the consumer, does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (1).

(3) Any electronic consumer reply to an electronic notice sent pursuant to this division is effective. A person that electronically sends a notice required by this division to a consumer may not by contract, or otherwise, eliminate the effectiveness of the consumer’s electronic reply.

(4) This division modifies the provisions of Section 101 of the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. However, it does not modify, limit, or supersede the provisions of subsection (c), (d), (e), (f), or (h) of Section 101 of the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, nor does it authorize electronic delivery of any notice of the type described in subsection (b) of Section 103 of that federal act.

(1) The financial institution has provided the consumer a notice meeting the requirements of subdivision (d) of Section 4053, and the consumer has not directed that nonpublic personal information not be disclosed. A response to a notice meeting the requirements of subdivision (d) directing the financial institution to not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated financial institution shall be deemed a direction to the financial institution to not disclose nonpublic personal information to an affinity partner, unless the form containing the notice provides the consumer with a separate choice for disclosure to affinity partners.

(2) The financial institution has a contractual agreement with the affinity partner that requires the affinity partner to maintain the confidentiality of the nonpublic personal information and prohibits affinity partners from using the information for any purposes other than verifying membership, verifying the consumer’s contact information, or offering the affinity partner’s own products or services to the consumer.

(1) For a mortgage or deed of trust, the annual percentage rate at consummation of the transaction will exceed by more than eight percentage points the yield on Treasury securities having comparable periods of maturity on the 15th day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the application for the extension of credit is received by the creditor.

(2) The total points and fees payable by the consumer at or before closing for a mortgage or deed of trust will exceed 6 percent of the total loan amount.

(c) “Points and fees” shall include the following:

For purposes of this division, a bridge loan is any temporary loan, having a maturity of one year or less, for the purpose of acquisition or construction of a dwelling intended to become the consumer’s principal dwelling.

(e) “Original principal balance” means the total initial amount the consumer is obligated to repay on the loan.

This division shall not be construed to prevent any enforcement by a governmental entity against any person who originates a loan and who is exempt or excluded from licensure by all of the licensing agencies, based on a violation of any provision of this division. This division shall not be construed to prevent the Bureau of Real Estate from enforcing this division against a licensed salesperson employed by a licensed real estate broker as if that salesperson were a licensed person under this division.

##### CHAPTER 2. Prohibited Acts [4973- 4973.]  

######### 4973.  
The following are prohibited acts and limitations for covered loans:

(a) (1) A covered loan shall not include a prepayment fee or penalty after the first 36 months after the date of consummation of the loan.

(2) A covered loan may include a prepayment fee or penalty up to the first 36 months after the date of consummation of the loan if:

(A) The person who originates the covered loan has also offered the consumer a choice of another product without a prepayment fee or penalty.

(B) The person who originates the covered loan has disclosed in writing to the consumer at least three business days prior to loan consummation the terms of the prepayment fee or penalty to the consumer for accepting a covered loan with the prepayment penalty and the rates, points, and fees that would be available to the consumer for accepting a covered loan without a prepayment penalty.

(C) The person who originates the covered loan has limited the amount of the prepayment fee or penalty to an amount not to exceed the payment of six months’ advance interest, at the contract rate of interest then in effect, on the amount prepaid in any 12-month period in excess of 20 percent of the original principal amount.

(D) A covered loan will not impose the prepayment fee or penalty if the covered loan is accelerated as a result of default.

(E) The person who originates the covered loan will not finance a prepayment penalty through a new loan that is originated by the same person.

(b) (1) A covered loan with a term of 5 years or less may not provide at origination for a payment schedule with regular periodic payments that when aggregated do not fully amortize the principal balance as of the maturity date of the loan.

(2) For a payment schedule that is adjusted to account for the seasonal or irregular income of the consumer, the total installments in any year shall not exceed the amount of one year’s worth of payments on the loan. This prohibition does not apply to a bridge loan. For purposes of this paragraph, “bridge loan” means a loan with a maturity of less than 18 months that only requires payments of interest until the time when the entire unpaid balance is due and payable.

(c) A covered loan shall not contain a provision for negative amortization such that the payment schedule for regular monthly payments causes the principal balance to increase, unless the covered loan is a first mortgage and the person who originates the loan discloses to the consumer that the loan contains a negative amortization provision that may add principal to the balance of the loan.

(d) A covered loan shall not include terms under which periodic payments required under the loan are consolidated and paid in advance from the loan proceeds.

(e) A covered loan shall not contain a provision that increases the interest rate as a result of a default. This provision does not apply to interest rate changes in a variable rate loan otherwise consistent with the provisions of the loan documents, provided the change in the interest rate is not triggered by the event of default or the acceleration for the indebtedness.

(f) (1) A person who originates covered loans shall not make or arrange a covered loan unless at the time the loan is consummated, the person reasonably believes the consumer, or consumers, when considered collectively in the case of multiple consumers, will be able to make the scheduled payments to repay the obligation based upon a consideration of their current and expected income, current obligations, employment status, and other financial resources, other than the consumer’s equity in the dwelling that secures repayment of the loan. In the case of a covered loan that is structured to increase to a specific designated rate, stated as a number or formula, at a specific predetermined date not exceeding 37 months from the date of application, this evaluation shall be based upon the fully indexed rate of the loan calculated at the time of application.

The consumer shall be presumed to be able to make the scheduled payments to repay the obligation if, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer’s total monthly debts, including amounts owed under the loan, do not exceed 55 percent of the consumer’s monthly gross income, as verified by the credit application, the consumer’s financial statement, a credit report, financial information provided to the person originating the loan by or on behalf of the consumer, or any other reasonable means.

(2) No presumption of inability to make the scheduled payments to repay the obligation shall arise solely from the fact that at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer’s total monthly debts, including amounts owed under the loan, exceed 55 percent of the consumer’s monthly gross income.

(3) In the case of a stated income loan, the reasonable belief requirement in paragraph (1) shall apply, however, for stated income loans that belief may be based on the income stated by the consumer, and other information in the possession of the person originating the loan after the solicitation of all information that the person customarily solicits in connection with loans of this type. A person shall not knowingly or willfully originate a covered loan as a stated income loan with the intent, or effect, of evading the provisions of this subdivision.

(g) A person who originates a covered loan shall not pay a contractor under a home-improvement contract from the proceeds of a covered loan other than by an instrument payable to the consumer or jointly to the consumer and the contractor or, at the election of the consumer, to a third-party escrow agent for the benefit of the contractor in accordance with terms and conditions established in a written escrow agreement signed by the consumer, the person who originates a covered loan, and the contractor prior to the disbursement of funds. No payments, other than progress payments for home-improvement work that the consumer certifies is completed, shall be made to an escrow account or jointly to the consumer and the contractor unless the person who originates the loan is presented with a signed and dated completion certificate by the consumer showing that the home-improvement contract was completed to the satisfaction of the consumer.

(h) It is unlawful for a person who originates a covered loan to recommend or encourage a consumer to default on an existing consumer loan or other debt in connection with the solicitation or making of a covered loan that refinances all or any portion of the existing consumer loan or debt.

(i) A covered loan shall not contain a call provision that permits the lender, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the indebtedness. This prohibition does not apply if repayment of the loan has been accelerated in accordance with the terms of the loan documents (1) as a result of the consumer’s default, (2) pursuant to a due-on-sale provision, or (3) due to fraud or material misrepresentation by a consumer in connection with the loan or the value of the security for the loan.

(j) A person who originates a covered loan shall not refinance or arrange for the refinancing of a consumer loan such that the new loan is a covered loan that is made for the purpose of refinancing, debt consolidation or cash out, that does not result in an identifiable benefit to the consumer, considering the consumer’s stated purpose for seeking the loan, fees, interest rates, finance charges, and points.

(k) (1) A covered loan shall not be made unless the following disclosure, written in 12-point font or larger, has been provided to the consumer no later than three business days prior to signing of the loan documents of the transaction:


# CONSUMER CAUTION AND HOME OWNERSHIP COUNSELING NOTICE

If you obtain this loan, the lender will have a mortgage on your home. You could lose your home, and any money you have put into it, if you do not meet your obligations under the loan.

Mortgage loan rates and closing costs and fees vary based on many other factors, including your particular credit and financial circumstances, your earnings history, the loan-to-value requested, and the type of property that will secure your loan. Higher rates and fees may be justified depending on the individual circumstances of a particular consumer’s application. You should shop around and compare loan rates and fees.

This particular loan may have a higher rate and total points and fees than other mortgage loans and is, or may be, subject to the additional disclosure and substantive protections under Division 1.7 (commencing with Section 4970) of the Financial Code. You should consider consulting a qualified independent credit counselor or other experienced financial adviser regarding the rate, fees, and provisions of this mortgage loan before you proceed. For information on contacting a qualified credit counselor, ask your lender or call the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development’s counseling hotline at 1-888-995-HOPE (4673) or go to www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/hcc/fc/ for a list of HUD-approved housing counseling agencies.

You are not required to complete any loan agreement merely because you have received these disclosures or have signed a loan application.

If you proceed with this mortgage loan, you should also remember that you may face serious financial risks if you use this loan to pay off credit card debts and other debts in connection with this transaction and then subsequently incur significant new credit card charges or other debts. If you continue to accumulate debt after this loan is closed and then experience financial difficulties, you could lose your home and any equity you have in it if you do not meet your mortgage loan obligations.

Property taxes and homeowner’s insurance are your responsibility. Not all lenders provide escrow services for these payments. You should ask your lender about these services.

Your payments on existing debts contribute to your credit ratings. You should not accept any advice to ignore your regular payments to your existing creditors. 

(2) It shall be a rebuttable presumption that a licensed person has met its obligation to provide this disclosure if the consumer provides the licensed person with a signed acknowledgment of receipt of a copy of the notice set forth in paragraph (1).

(l) (1) A person who originates a covered loan shall not steer, counsel, or direct any prospective consumer to accept a loan product with a risk grade less favorable than the risk grade that the consumer would qualify for based on that person’s then current underwriting guidelines, prudently applied, considering the information available to that person, including the information provided by the consumer.

A person shall not be deemed to have violated this section if the risk grade determination applied to a consumer is reasonably based on the person’s underwriting guidelines if it is an appropriate risk grade category for which the consumer qualifies with the person.

(2) If a broker originates a covered loan, the broker shall not steer, counsel, or direct any prospective consumer to accept a loan product at a higher cost than that for which the consumer could qualify based on the loan products offered by the persons with whom the broker regularly does business.

(m) A person who originates a covered loan shall not avoid, or attempt to avoid, the application of this division by doing the following:

(1) Structuring a loan transaction as an open-end credit plan for the purpose of evading the provisions of this division when the loan would have been a covered loan if the loan had been structured as a closed end loan.

(2) Dividing any loan transaction into separate parts for the purpose of evading the provisions of this division.

(n) A person who originates a covered loan shall not act in any manner, whether specifically prohibited by this section or of a different character, that constitutes fraud.







##### CHAPTER 3. Enforcement [4974 - 4979.8]  

######### 4974.  
(a) Any compliance failure that was not willful or intentional and resulted from a bona fide error, that occurred notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adopted to avoid those errors, including, but not limited to, those involving clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and programming, and printing errors shall be corrected no later than 45 days after receipt of the complaint or discovery of the error. A person who originates a covered loan shall not be administratively, civilly, or criminally liable for a bona fide error corrected pursuant to this section.

(b) If a person who originates covered loans makes a loan where the person knew of and showed reckless disregard for a violation of this division by a broker, the person and broker shall be jointly and severally liable for all damages awarded under this division with respect to the broker’s unlawful conduct.

This section does not impose or transfer liability for a breach of the broker’s fiduciary duty.

######### 5321.  
(a) The prosecuting agency shall, prior to, in conjunction with, or subsequent to the criminal proceeding, file a petition of forfeiture with the superior court of the county in which the defendant has been or will be charged with the underlying criminal offense. The petition shall allege that the defendant has engaged in acts chargeable as crimes pursuant to the criminal provisions enumerated in Section 5320 and shall identify the property subject to forfeiture. A notice regarding the petition shall be provided, by personal service or registered mail, to every person who may have an interest in the property specified in the petition. However, if the notice cannot be given by registered mail or personal delivery, the notice shall be published for at least three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the property is located. The notice shall state that any interested person may file a verified claim with the superior court stating the amount of their claimed interest and an affirmation or denial of the prosecuting agency’s allegation. The notice shall set forth the time within which a claim of interest in the property seized is required to be filed.

(b) If the property alleged to be subject to forfeiture is real property, the prosecuting agency shall, at the time of filing the petition of forfeiture, record a lis pendens in each county in which the real property is situated which specifically identifies the property by legal description, the name of the owner of record as shown on the latest equalized assessment roll, and assessor’s parcel number. The judgment of forfeiture shall not affect the interest in real property of any third party which was acquired prior to the recording of the lis pendens.

(c) If a petition of forfeiture is filed pursuant to this section prior to filing of the complaint in a criminal action, the prosecuting agency shall provide concurrent notice to any parties subject to the proposed forfeiture that they are targets of an anticipated criminal action.

(d) If a petition of forfeiture is filed pursuant to this section prior to the filing of a complaint in a criminal action, the petition and any injunctive order shall be dismissed by operation of law, unless a criminal complaint or grand jury indictment is filed within 120 days after the filing of the petition. If a petition is dismissed pursuant to this section, it shall not be refiled, except upon the filing of a criminal complaint or grand jury indictment.



######### 5322.  
(a) Any person claiming an interest in the property may, at any time within 30 days from the date of the first publication of the notice of seizure, or within 30 days after receipt of actual notice, file with the superior court of the county in which the action is pending a verified claim stating his or her interest in the property or proceeds. A verified copy of the claim shall be given by the claimant to the Attorney General or district attorney, as appropriate.

(b) (1) If, at the end of the time set forth in subdivision (a), an interested person, other than the defendant, has not filed a claim, the court, upon motion, shall declare that the person has defaulted upon his or her alleged interest, and it shall be subject to forfeiture upon proof of the provisions of subdivision (d).

(2) The defendant may admit or deny that the property is subject to forfeiture pursuant to the provisions of this article. If the defendant fails to admit or deny or to file a claim of interest in the property or proceeds, the court shall enter a response of denial on behalf of the defendant.

(c) (1) The forfeiture proceeding shall be set for hearing in the superior court in which the underlying criminal offense will be tried.

(2) If the defendant is found guilty of the underlying offense, the issue of forfeiture shall be promptly tried, either before the same jury or before a new jury in the discretion of the court, unless waived by the consent of all parties.

(d) At the forfeiture hearing, the prosecuting agency shall have the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was engaged in actions in violation of Sections 5303, 5304, 5305, and 5306 and that the property specified in the petition otherwise meets the criteria for forfeiture under Section 5320. If a jury is the trier of fact, the verdict shall be unanimous in order to impose the forfeiture.



######### 5323.  
(a) Concurrent with, or subsequent to, the filing of the petition, the prosecuting agency may move the superior court for the following pendente lite orders to preserve the status quo of the property alleged in the petition of forfeiture:

(1) An injunction to restrain all interested parties and enjoin them from transferring, encumbering, hypothecating or otherwise disposing of that property.

(2) Appointment of a receiver to take possession of, care for, manage, and operate the assets and properties so that such property may be maintained and preserved.

(b) No preliminary injunction may be granted or receiver appointed without notice, that meets the requirements of Section 5321, to all the interested parties, including actual notice to targets of the anticipated criminal action, and a hearing to determine that such an order is necessary to preserve the property, pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings, and that there is probable cause to believe that the property alleged in the forfeiture proceedings are proceeds or property interests forfeitable under Section 5320. However, a temporary restraining order may issue pending that hearing pursuant to the provisions of Section 527 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

(1) In determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order in a proceeding brought by a prosecuting agency in conjunction with or subsequent to the underlying criminal proceeding, the court shall weigh the relative degree of certainty of the outcome on the merits and the consequences to each of the parties of granting the interim relief. If the prosecution is likely to prevail on the merits and the potential harm to the public outweighs the potential harm to the defendants and the interested parties, the court should grant injunctive relief. The court shall give significant weight to the following factors:

(A) The public interest in preserving liquid capital and other financial assets pendente lite.

(B) The difficulty of preserving financial assets pendente lite where the underlying alleged crimes involve issues of fraud and moral turpitude.

(C) The fact that the requested relief is being sought by a public prosecutor on behalf of alleged victims of financial crimes.

(D) The likelihood that substantial public harm has occurred where financial crimes are alleged to have been committed.

(2) In determining whether to issue a permanent injunction or temporary restraining order in a proceeding brought by a prosecuting agency before the filing of a complaint in the underlying criminal proceeding, the court shall weigh the relative degree of certainty of the outcome on the merits and the consequences to each of the parties of granting the interim relief.

(3) No injunctive order issued under this section shall impair the ability of a defendant or interested party to pay the actual legal fees or retainer for his or her legal defense to the criminal charges and the petition for forfeiture.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court in granting these motions may order a surety bond or undertaking to preserve the property interests of the interested parties, but the court shall give significant weight to the unique circumstances of public agencies, as opposed to private litigants, in determining whether to order a surety bond or undertaking.

(d) The court shall, in making its orders, seek to protect the interests of those who may be involved in the same enterprise as the defendant, but who were not involved in the commission of the violation of a crime enumerated in Section 5320.



######### 5324.  
(a) If the trier of fact at the forfeiture hearing finds that the alleged property or proceeds is forfeitable pursuant to Section 5320, the court shall declare that property or proceeds forfeited to the state or local governmental entity, subject to distribution as provided in Section 5325. No property solely owned by a bona fide purchaser for value shall be subject to forfeiture.

(b) If the trier of fact at the forfeiture hearing finds that the alleged property is forfeitable pursuant to Section 5320, but does not find that a person holding a valid lien, mortgage, security interest, or interest under a conditional sales contract acquired that interest with actual knowledge that the property was to be used for a purpose for which forfeiture is permitted, and the amount due to that person is less than the appraised value of the property, that person may pay to the state or the local governmental entity which initiated the forfeiture proceeding, the amount of the difference between the appraised value of the property and the amount of the lien, mortgage, security interest, or interest under a conditional sales contract. Upon that payment, the state or local governmental entity shall relinquish all claims to the property. If the holder of the interest elects not to make that payment to the state or local governmental entity, the property shall be deemed forfeited to the state or local governmental entity and any indicia of ownership of the property shall be forwarded. The appraised value shall be determined as of the date judgment is entered either (a) by agreement between the holder of the lien, mortgage, security interest, or interest under a conditional sales contract and the governmental entity involved or (b) if they cannot agree, then by a court-appointed appraiser for the county in which the action is brought. A person holding a valid lien, mortgage, security interest, or interest under a conditional sales contract shall be paid the appraised value of his or her interest.

(c) If the amount due to a person holding a valid lien, mortgage, security interest, or interest under a conditional sales contract is less than the value of the property and the person elects not to make payment to the governmental entity, the property shall be sold at public auction by the county if the district attorney is the prosecutor, by the city if the city attorney is the prosecutor, or by the Department of General Services if the Attorney General is the prosecutor. Notice of the sale shall be provided by one publication in a newspaper published and circulated in the city, community, or locality where the sale is to take place.



######### 5325.  
Notwithstanding that no response or claim has been filed pursuant to Section 5322, in all cases where property is forfeited pursuant to this article and, where necessary, sold by the Department of General Services or local governmental entity, the money forfeited or the proceeds of sale shall be distributed by the state or local governmental entity as follows:

(a) To the bona fide or innocent purchaser, conditional sales vendor, or holder of a valid lien, mortgage or security interest, if any, and from the balance of any forfeited funds to any victim of a crime enumerated in Section 5320 committed by the defendant, up to the amount of his or her interest in the property or proceeds, when the court declaring the forfeiture orders a distribution to that person. The court shall endeavor to discover all such lienholders and protect their interests and may, at its discretion, order the proceeds placed in escrow for up to an additional 60 days to ensure that all valid claims are received and processed. The aggregate of all money distributed pursuant to this subdivision and all money received pursuant to a restitution order of a court shall not exceed the amount of the person’s interest in the property or proceeds.

(b) To the Department of General Services or local governmental entity for all expenditures made or incurred by it in connection with the sale of the property, including expenditures for any necessary repairs, storage, or transportation of any property seized under this article.

(c) The balance of forfeiture funds remaining after the obligations in subdivisions (a) and (b) have been satisfied shall be paid to the general fund of the state or local governmental entity, whichever prosecutes.

Any amendment to the articles of incorporation and bylaws of an association which for the first time authorizes it to issue stock shall be approved by the vote or written assent of a majority of the total votes of members outstanding, except that the amendment shall require approval only of the commissioner and board of directors of an association if the commissioner finds that grounds exist for the appointment of a conservator for the association pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 8225.

(b) An amendment to the articles of incorporation of an association pursuant to this section may include provisions with respect to the surplus, reserves, and undivided profits of the association and in that case the surplus, reserves, and undivided profits shall be retained and disposed of in accordance with those provisions.

(c) The corporate existence of a mutual association which amends its articles of incorporation pursuant to this section to authorize the issuance of stock and which issues stock shall continue to be, and the resulting stock association shall be deemed to be, a continuation of the mutual association. The Legislature finds and declares that Section 563b.41 (d)(3) of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations sets forth the law of this state with regard to the continuity of corporate existence in mutual association to stock association conversions and that this section has reflected that law from the time of the original adoption of Section 563b.41 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

(c) No association shall reduce the par or stated value of its outstanding capital stock without first obtaining the written approval of the commissioner, and approval shall be withheld if the reduction would cause the par or stated value of outstanding capital stock to be less than the minimum required by this division or would result in less than adequate statutory net worth as the commissioner may determine under Section 6475.

(d) No association shall retire any part of its capital stock unless the retirement is approved by the commissioner.

(a) No certificate of approval of articles of incorporation of a proposed association having the same name as an association in existence in this state on the date an application is filed under Section 5401, or a name so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive, shall be issued by the commissioner, except to an association formed by the reincorporation, reorganization, or consolidation of the association with other associations, or upon the sale of the property or franchise of an association. The commissioner may presume that the use of any word or words already adopted, appropriated, or used in its corporate name by any association then existing in this state, except the words “the,” “and,” “mutual,” “guarantee,” “building,” “loan,” “savings,” “association,” or “bank,” constitutes such similarity of names as to be likely to mislead the public.

######### 5653.  
Upon application by the commissioner or any association, a court of competent jurisdiction may issue an injunction to restrain any person from violating or continuing to violate any of the provisions of Section 5652. Any person who violates any provision of Section 5652 shall be punished by a fine of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), and each day of violation shall constitute a separate offense. The prohibitions of Section 5652 shall not apply to any corporation or association formed for the purpose of promoting the interests of thrift institutions, the membership of which is comprised of thrift institutions, their officers, or other representatives.

##### ARTICLE 6. Conversions [5700 - 5718]  

######### 5700.  
A state association may convert itself into a federal association by following the procedure outlined in Sections 5701 through 5708.



######### 5701.  
At any regular or special meeting called to consider the conversion of an association into a federal association, in the case of a stock association, the stockholders entitled to vote and any members entitled to vote, by an affirmative majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy; and in the case of a mutual association the members, by action on a proposal approved by the members, may resolve to convert the association into a federal association.



######### 5702.  
Any executor, administrator, guardian, conservator of a natural person or receiver, and any fiduciary or trustee, and any public corporation, political subdivision, public instrumentality, charitable institution, educational and eleemosynary institution, trust company or financial institution, and any insurance company or cemetery association may, without obtaining court approval:

(a) Vote in person or by proxy in favor of or against converting a state association into a federal association, or may approve or disapprove the determination to so convert.

(b) Exchange any stock, savings accounts, or other rights or claims, for securities issued by the federal association, and hold the securities as legal investments.



######### 5703.  
Promptly after the meeting approving a conversion into a federal association, the association shall file in the office of the commissioner a certificate verified by the president or vice president and the secretary or assistant secretary of the association. The certificate shall contain a copy of the minutes of the meeting and a statement of the number of stockholders and members entitled to vote and the number voting to approve the determination to convert the association into a federal association. A like certificate shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State.



######### 5704.  
A certified copy of the certificate required by Section 5703 filed in the office of the Secretary of State is presumptive evidence of the holding of the meeting, the action taken at the meeting, and of the approval of stockholders and members.



######### 5705.  
After the meeting of the stockholders and members, the association shall take any action necessary to make it a federal association, and promptly after receipt of the federal charter the association shall file in the office of the commissioner and in the office of the Secretary of State, a copy of the charter issued to it by the Office of Thrift Supervision or a certificate showing the organization of the association as a federal association certified by or on behalf of the Office of Thrift Supervision. Upon the filing of this instrument in the office of the Secretary of State the association ceases to be a state association and is a federal association.



######### 5706.  
At the time the conversion into a federal association becomes effective the association ceases to be supervised by this state and all of the property of the association, including all of its right, title, and interest in and to all property of every kind and character immediately, by operation of law and without any conveyance, or transfer and without any further act or deed, is vested in the association under its new name and style as a federal association and under its new jurisdiction.



######### 5707.  
The converted federal association shall have, hold, and enjoy the property mentioned in Section 5706 in its own right as fully and to the same extent as the property was possessed, held, and enjoyed by it as a state association and the federal association shall continue to be responsible for all of the obligations of the converted state association to the same extent as though the conversion had not taken place. The federal association is merely a continuation of the state association under a new name and new jurisdiction and the revision of its corporate structure as is considered necessary for its proper operation under the new  jurisdiction.



######### 5708.  
Where a copy of a charter of a federal association, issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board pursuant to the laws of the United States was filed with the Secretary of State prior to September 13, 1941, with the intent of converting a building and loan association organized and existing under the laws of this state into a federal association, those conversions are validated, legalized, ratified and confirmed.



######### 5709.  
Any federal association may convert itself into an association by following the procedure set forth in Sections 5710 through 5718.



######### 5710.  
At any regular or special meeting called to consider the action, the stockholders and members entitled to vote by an affirmative majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy, may resolve to convert a federal association into an association.



######### 5711.  
Copies of the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting of the stockholders or members in which they vote to convert into an association, verified by the president or vice president and the secretary or an assistant secretary, shall be filed promptly after the meeting in the office of the commissioner, and, in duplicate, with the federal home loan bank of which the association is a member.



######### 5712.  
The verified copies of the minutes of the meeting, when filed as required by Section 5711, are presumptive evidence of the holding and action of the meeting.



######### 5713.  
After a meeting as provided for in Section 5710, the federal association shall take or cause to be taken such action as shall make it an association in the manner prescribed and authorized by this division. The directors elected at the meeting shall file the documents with applicable fees and take such proceedings as are required by this division in the case of the original incorporation of an association. The decision for approval or denial shall be issued in writing. No association incorporated by conversion from a federal association is required to comply with any of the provisions of law or any regulations promulgated by the commissioner relating to the minimum amounts of capital required to be subscribed in connection with the original incorporation of an association under this division.



######### 5714.  
The directors of an association converted from a federal association may insert in the articles of incorporation the following statement: “This association is incorporated by conversion from a federal savings and loan association. ”



######### 5715.  
Promptly after the filing of the articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State, there shall be filed with the federal home loan bank of which the association is a member, two copies of the articles of incorporation, certified by the Secretary of State.



######### 5716.  
Upon the filing of the articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State, the federal association ceases to be a federal association and is an association under the laws of this state. All of the property of the federal association, including all of its right, title, and interest in and to all property of every kind and character immediately, by operation of law and without any conveyance or transfer, and without any further act or deed, is vested in the association under its new name and style as an association and under its new jurisdiction.



######### 5717.  
The converted association shall have, hold, and enjoy the property mentioned in Section 5716 in its own right as fully and to the same extent as the property was possessed, held and enjoyed by it as a federal association and the converted association continues responsible for all of the obligations of the converted federal association to the same extent as though conversion had not taken place. The association is merely a continuation of the federal association under a new name and new jurisdiction and such revision of its corporate structure as is considered necessary for its proper operation under the new jurisdiction.



######### 5718.  
In the event stock is to be issued by the converted association, the commissioner may issue an organizing permit to the federal association or to the board of directors elected to serve after conversion, authorizing the association or the board of directors to take subscriptions to stock, to collect subscription payments and to impound the payments pending the issuance of stock, and authorizing the converted association to issue stock after the filing of its articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State. The commissioner may require that all stock to be initially issued be subscribed and fully paid. The commissioner may also issue a certificate of authority to the converted association to be effective upon filing of its articles of incorporation, and may also issue any other orders and permits necessary to authorize the association to continue business without interruption upon the filing of its articles of incorporation.

(c) As a step in a plan of the reorganization, merger, consolidation, or transfer under this section, an interim corporation may be formed.

######### 5754.  
In a merger the agreement shall state any matters with respect to which the articles of the surviving association are deemed amended and the articles shall be amended accordingly, without any further proceedings, upon the effective date of the merger, but with respect to any amendments, the agreement shall meet the requirements of Section 907 of the Corporations Code in identifying any provisions to be amended, stricken, or added and shall set forth in full the wording of the provision as amended or added or the wording of the amended articles if they be amended in full.

(b) Subject to any regulations of the commissioner, an association may make or acquire loans directly or indirectly to or from any director, officer, affiliated person, or any parent or subsidiary. Loans made or acquired, directly or indirectly, the proceeds of which are intended to inure or have inured to the benefit of these parties are subject to the same regulations.

Except with the prior written consent of the commissioner, no association shall knowingly make:

(a) Any loan to any corporation of which 10 percent or more of the stock is owned or controlled individually or collectively by any one or more of the directors, officers, employees, or substantial stockholders of the association.

As used in this subdivision, “substantial stockholder” means a person who has a real or beneficial ownership of more than 10 percent of the outstanding stock of the association. For this purpose, stock owned by the person’s immediate family shall be deemed owned by that person.

(b) Any loan the proceeds of which are intended to inure to the benefit of any corporation specified in subdivision (a).



######### 7451.  
Except as otherwise provided by the commissioner, an association shall not make or acquire total loans with respect to one borrower or on one project in an amount exceeding 25 percent of the net worth of the association.

This subdivision shall not apply to loans (1) secured by real property, (2) sold without recourse, (3) on the security of the association’s deposit accounts, or (4) of unsecured day funds, including federal funds or similar unsecured loans.

(e) As used in this section the term “one borrower” means:

(1) Any person that is, or upon the making of a loan will become, an obligor on the loans. However, a guarantor shall not be included within the meaning of “obligor” if, in connection with a loan the association has determined, in good faith, that the primary obligor has qualified for the loan irrespective of the existence of the guarantor. In the case of a loan that has been assumed by a third party with the consent of the association, the former debtor and any guarantor shall not be deemed to be an “obligor.”

(2) Nominees of the obligor.

(3) All persons, trusts, syndicates, partnerships and corporations of which the obligor is a nominee, a beneficiary, a member, a general partner, a limited partner owning an interest of 10 percent or more based on the value of his or her capital contribution, or a record or beneficial stockholder owning 10 percent or more of the capital stock.

######### 7460.  
(a) Notwithstanding Section 726 of the Code of Civil Procedure or any other provision of law to the contrary, an association, a federal association, an affiliate of an association or federal association, a service corporation, or any successor in interest thereto, that originates, acquires, or purchases, in whole or in part, any loan secured directly or collaterally, in whole or in part, by a mortgage or deed of trust on real property, or any interest therein, may bring an action for recovery of damages, including exemplary damages not to exceed 50 percent of the actual damages, against a borrower where the action is based on fraud under Section 1572 of the Civil Code and the fraudulent conduct by the borrower induced the original lender to make that loan.

(b) The provisions of this section shall not apply to loans secured by single-family, owner-occupied residential real property, when the property is actually occupied by the borrower as represented to the lender in order to obtain the loan and the loan is for an amount of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) or less, as adjusted annually, commencing on January 1, 1987, to the Consumer Price Index as published by the United States Department of Labor.

##### ARTICLE 6. Real Estate Loans [7500 - 7509]  

######### 7500.  
(a) Subject to limitations, if any, within this chapter, an association may originate, invest in, sell, purchase, service, participate, or otherwise deal in (including brokerage or warehousing) loans, including construction loans, made on the security of residential or nonresidential real property, or interests in these loans.

(b) No investment in real property or a real estate loan shall be made by an association until one or more written appraisal reports, prepared at the request of an association or its agent, have been submitted to the association by a person or persons meeting the qualification standards for an appraiser as set forth in the commissioner’s regulations. No commitment to disburse shall be made by the association until the person or persons have been duly appointed and qualified as appraisers by the association. Such a person or persons shall have made a physical inspection and submitted to the association a fully documented appraisal of the real estate that would secure the loan or constitute the investment, or, in the case of a purchased loan, the person or persons have reviewed and approved an appraisal report in support of the loan. If the balance of any purchased loan is one million dollars ($1,000,000) or more, the person or persons reviewing and approving the appraisal report shall have inspected the real estate. Each appraisal report submitted to an association pursuant to this subdivision shall be signed and shall include the tax identification number, social security number, or other form of verifiable identification of the person or persons signing the appraisal report.

(c) For the purpose of determining appraised value, unimproved property without offsite improvements shall be evaluated as though offsite improvements have been installed if a subdivision map has been recorded and a bond or other instrument guaranteeing installation of the offsite improvements has been accepted by the governing authorities in connection with the recording of the subdivision map.



######### 7501.  
Each real estate loan shall be evidenced by a note or instrument of obligation for the amount of the loan. The note or instrument shall specify the amount and terms of repayment including any penalty or charge for late payment, and may contain all other terms of the loan contract.



######### 7502.  
(a) Each real estate loan shall be secured by a deed of trust, mortgage, or other transaction or instrument constituting a lien or claim, or its equivalent, upon the real estate securing the loan, according to any lawful and recognized practice that is suited to the transaction. Any deed of trust or other instrument or transaction constituting a lien or claim is included in the term “mortgage” in this division.

(b) A mortgage shall provide specifically for full protection to the association with respect to the loan and additional advances, including any terms and conditions that the association deems necessary and appropriate to state the agreement between the parties.



######### 7503.  
Except as specified by the loan contract or by Section 2954.8 of the Civil Code, an association shall have no obligation to pay interest to the borrower upon funds credited to an impound, trust, or other type of account for payment of taxes, insurance, or other charges relating to the property, or to invest them for the benefit of the borrower, unless the funds have been placed in an interest bearing savings account under the terms of the loan contract.



######### 7504.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an association may adjust the interest rate, payment, balance, or term-to-maturity on any loan secured by real property as authorized by the loan contract, and may receive a portion of the consideration for making a real estate loan in the form of a percentage of the amount by which the current market value of the property during the loan term or at maturity exceeds the original appraised value, subject to the limitations of subdivision (b) and Section 341 of P.L. 97-320 (H.R. 6267, the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982).

(a) For the purposes of this section:

(1) “Fully amortized loan” means a loan in which, at inception of the loan, the entire principal balance, together with accrued interest, shall be payable with the scheduled term of the loan in substantially equal installments (excepting the last payment, which may be smaller than a regular scheduled payment).

(2) “Home loans” means loans made on the security of one- to four-unit residential dwellings (including condominiums and cooperatives), combinations of these dwellings and business property (where no more than 20 percent of the total appraised value of the real estate is attributable to the business use), farm residences and combinations of farm residences and commercial farm real property.

(3) “Nonamortized loan” means a loan in which none of the principal balance shall be payable prior to the maturity of the loan.

(4) “Open end line of credit” means a loan plan in which the association reasonably contemplates repeated transactions; the association may impose interest from time to time on the unpaid principal of the loan plan, and the amount of credit that may be extended to the borrower during the term of the loan plan (up to any limit set by the association) is generally made available to the extent that any outstanding principal balance is repaid.

(5) “Partially amortized loan” means a loan in which some but not all of the principal balance, together with accrued interest, shall be payable prior to the maturity of the loan.

(6) “Reverse annuity mortgage” means an instrument which provides for periodic payments to be made to a homeowner based on accumulated equity. The payments are made monthly directly by the association, or are made through the purchase of an annuity from an insurance company. The loan becomes due on a specified date after disbursement of the entire principal amount of the loan or when a specified event occurs, such as sale of the property or death of the borrower. The interest rate on this instrument may be fixed, or may be adjusted periodically as provided by this section.

(b) Adjustments to the interest rate, payment, balance, or term-to-maturity on home loans shall be subject to the limitations of this subdivision.

(1) The loan term shall not exceed 40 years, with interest payable at least semiannually, except as expressly authorized by this section.

(2) The loan balance for other than nonamortized and open end line of credit loans shall be repayable in at least semiannual installments; provided, that loans on the security of farm residences and combinations of farm residences and commercial farm real property may be repayable in annual installments.

(3) The loan may be fully amortized, partially amortized, nonamortized, a reverse annuity mortgage, or an open end line of credit loan. The loan contract may provide for the deferral of principal and capitalization of a portion of interest, or of all interest, in the case of loans to natural persons secured by borrower-occupied real property and on which periodic advances are being made.

(4) (A) At origination, the loan-to-value ratio may not exceed the maximum permitted by Section 7509, as determined by the association’s board of directors (but not more than 100 percent). During the term of the loan, the loan-to-value ratio may increase above the maximum percentage otherwise permissible if the increase results from an adjustment described in paragraph (3) or (5). The commissioner shall assume continued compliance with applicable loan-to-value limitations where the original loan-to-value ratio met the requirements of this paragraph, but in no event may the loan balance exceed 125 percent of the original appraised value of the security property during the term of the loan unless pursuant to clause (i) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (5) of subdivision (b) or unless the loan contract provides that the payment shall be adjusted at least once every five years, beginning no later than the 10th year of the loan, to a level sufficient to amortize the loan at the then existing interest rate and loan balance over the remaining term of the loan. However, this 125 percent limitation shall not apply to the portion of a loan balance that is interest received in the form of a percentage of the appreciation in value of the security property.

(B) If, at maturity of a loan secured by a home that provides for adjustments pursuant to paragraph (3) or (5), the ratio of the loan balance to the current market value of the security property exceeds the maximum permissible amount under Section 7509, the association may offer to refinance the loan if (i) the refinanced loan complies with subdivision (b) of Section 7509 and (ii) the loan contract for the refinanced loan requires that, in addition to full or partial amortization of the loan, the pro rata portion, based on the number of installments due annually, of estimated annual taxes and assessments on the security property be paid in advance to the association with each installment payment.

(5) For any home loan secured by borrower-occupied property or property to be occupied by the borrower, adjustments to the interest rate, payment, balance, or term-to-maturity shall comply with the limitations of this paragraph.

(A) Adjustments to the interest rate shall correspond directly to the movement of an interest rate index or of a national or regional index that measures the rate of inflation or the rate of change in consumer disposable income, which index is readily available to, and verifiable by, the borrower and is beyond the direct control of the association. An association also may increase the interest rate pursuant to a formula or schedule that specifies the amount of the increase and the time at which it may be made and which is set forth in the loan contract. An association, in its sole discretion, may decrease the interest rate at any time.

(B) Adjustments to the payment and the loan balance that do not reflect an interest rate adjustment may be made if: (i) the adjustments reflect a change in a national or regional index that measures the rate of inflation or the rate of change in consumer disposable income, is readily available to and verifiable by the borrower, and is beyond the direct control of the association; (ii) in the case of a payment adjustment, the adjustment reflects a change in the loan balance or is made pursuant to a formula, or to a schedule specifying the percentage or dollar change in the payment as set forth in the loan contract; or (iii) in the case of an open end line of credit loan, the adjustment reflects an advance taken by the borrower under the line of credit, or a payment made by the borrower, that is permitted by the loan contract.

(C) Any combination of indices or a moving average of index values may be used as an index, and an association (i) may use more than one index during the term of a loan, if set forth in the loan contract and (ii) may provide for the selection of a substitute index by the association in the event the index being used is no longer available to or verifiable by the borrower or as otherwise provided in the loan contract.

(D) The loan term may be adjusted only to reflect a change in the interest rate, the payment or the loan balance. A loan contract may provide an association with the right to call the loan due and payable either after a specified period of time has elapsed following the date of the loan contract or as specified in a reverse annuity mortgage.

(6) For any home loan secured by borrower-occupied property and on which the interest rate may be adjusted pursuant to paragraph (5), an association may not impose a prepayment charge on any prepayment made within 90 days of a required notice of an interest-rate increase with respect to the loan.

(c) Disclosure and notices for loans made pursuant to this section shall comply with the regulations codified in Section 563.99 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations.



######### 7505.  
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an association may originate, invest in, sell, purchase, service, participate, or otherwise deal in loans (including construction loans) on the security of real property for primarily residential (other than a one- to four-unit dwelling) or nonresidential use, subject to the limitations of this article.

(b) An association’s aggregate investment in real property loans for primarily nonresidential use under this section shall not exceed 40 percent of assets.



######### 7505.5.  
(a) A savings association may make loans the principal purpose of which is to provide financing with respect to what is, or what is to become, primarily residential real estate, for which the association relies substantially on the borrower’s general credit standing and projected future income for repayment, without other security, or relies on other assurances for repayment, including guarantees or other obligations of third parties.

(b) An association’s aggregate investment in residential real estate loans described in subdivision (a) shall not exceed an amount equal to 5 percent of the association’s assets.



######### 7506.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, an association may make a loan secured by an assignment of a loan or loans to the extent that it could, under applicable law and regulations, make or purchase the underlying assigned loan or loans.



######### 7507.  
(a)  An association may make loans or advances of credit, or invest in interests therein, on the security of real property, which loans, advances of credit, or investments are not otherwise authorized under the law because of the following reasons:

(1) The loan-to-value ratio, stated maturity, or loan amount is in excess of the maximum allowable limits.

(2) Lack of any required borrower certification or required private mortgage insurance.

(3) The loan would cause an applicable percentage-of-assets category to be exceeded.

(4) A combination of the foregoing factors.

(b) Investments made under the authority of this section are subject to the following restrictions:

(1) No association shall have investments under this section aggregating at any one time more than 5 percent of its total assets.

(2) Each investment made under this section shall be fully documented to support the conclusion that it was made on a prudent basis.

(3) Loans made pursuant to this section shall comply with subparagraph (D) of paragraph (5), and paragraph (6), of subdivision (b), of Section 7504, where applicable.



######### 7509.  
(a) (1) At the time of origination, a real estate loan may not exceed 100 percent of the market value of security property. An association shall, by vote of its board of directors, establish maximum loan-to-value ratios for loans made on the security of real estate, and the resolution adopting those ratios shall be included in the minutes of the directors’ meeting. Home loans, as defined in Section 7504, made on the combined security of real estate and savings accounts may be made in excess of the maximum loan-to-value ratios adopted pursuant to this subdivision with the excess secured by the savings account.

(2) However, for loans originated in excess of 90 percent of the initial appraised value of the security property, the savings account shall consist only of funds belonging to the borrower, the borrower’s family, or the borrower’s employer, and the loans shall not exceed the appraised value of the real estate.

(b) With respect to home loans originated or refinanced in excess of 90 percent of the appraised value of the security property, that part of the unpaid balance that exceeds 80 percent of the property value shall be insured or guaranteed by a mortgage insurance company that the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation has determined to be a “qualified private insurer.”

(c) With respect to all other loans on the security of real estate originated in excess of 90 percent of the appraised value of the security property, an association’s board of directors shall approve each of these loans prior to its origination and that approval shall be recorded in the minutes of its meeting.

(d) An association shall not make a loan secured by unimproved real property if the loan-to-value ratio would exceed 80 percent of the appraised value of the unimproved real property securing the loan.

(e) In determining compliance with maximum loan-to-value-ratio limitations for real estate loans, at the time of making a loan, an association shall add together the unpaid amount, or in the case of a line-of-credit loan, the approved credit limit, of all recorded loans secured by prior mortgages, liens, or other encumbrances on the security property that would have priority over the association’s lien, and shall not make the loan unless the total amount of those loans, including the loan to be made but excluding loans that will be paid off out of the proceeds of the new loan, does not exceed the applicable maximum loan-to-value-ratio limitations prescribed in this subdivision. In determining the value of the real estate security, an association shall use the current appraised value of the security property, which may include any expected value of improvements to be financed.

(f) “Value” for a real estate loan means the market value of the real estate.








##### ARTICLE 7. Successors in Interest in Loans [7600- 7600.]  

######### 7600.  
In the case of any investment made by an association in a real estate loan, in the event all or part of the ownership of the real estate security becomes vested in a person other than the party or parties originally executing the security instruments and if there is not an agreement in writing to the contrary, an association may, without notice to the party or parties, deal with a successor in interest to the mortgage and debt in the same manner as with the original party or parties, and may forbear to sue or may extend time for payment of or otherwise modify the terms of the debt, without discharging or in any way affecting the original liability of the party or parties or their debt.








##### ARTICLE 8. Salvage of Loans and Investments [7650- 7650.]  

######### 7650.  
(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), nothing in this division or the laws of this state shall be construed as denying to an association the right to invest its funds, operate a business, manage or deal in property, or take any other action over whatever period of time may reasonably be necessary to avoid loss on a loan or investment made or an obligation created in good faith.

(b) Associations which do not meet the requirements of Section 6475, or have been issued an order pursuant to Section 8200, shall not take any action pursuant to this section without first obtaining approval, in writing, from the commissioner.

Subject to compliance with these standards, an association, an affiliate or service corporation of an association shall permit a borrower to have reasonable freedom of choice in selecting the insurer to provide hazard insurance coverage on the real estate security.

##### CHAPTER 4. Licensee Regulations [12300 - 12332]  

######### 12300.  
The commissioner may make general rules and regulations and specific rulings, demands, and findings for the enforcement of this division.



######### 12300.1.  
Licensees shall observe reasonable precautions against theft or alteration of checks, drafts or money orders, and against burglary or holdup.



######### 12300.2.  
Every person engaging in the business of a check seller shall conduct the business under his or her true name unless he or she has complied with Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 17900) of Part 3 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code.



######### 12300.3.  
All funds received by a licensee or its agents from the sale of checks, drafts, money orders, or other commercial paper serving the same purpose and for the purpose of paying bills, invoices, or accounts of an obligor, equal in amount to the face value of such instruments or equal to the amount to be paid, shall constitute trust funds owned by and belonging to the person from whom they were received or a licensee who has paid the checks, drafts, money orders or other commercial paper serving the same purpose, for which the funds of such persons have been received by the agent but not transmitted to such licensee or deposited in the trust account of such licensee. If a licensee or an agent of a licensee shall commingle such funds with those of his own, all assets of such agent shall be impressed with a trust in favor of said purchaser or the licensee in an amount equal to the aggregate funds received or which should have been received by the agent from such sale. Such trust shall continue until an amount equal to said funds is separated from those of the agent and transmitted to the licensee or deposited in the trust account of licensee. An amount equal to all such trust funds shall be deposited in a bank or banks in an account or accounts in the name of the licensee designated “trust account,” or by some other appropriate name indicating that the funds are not the funds of the licensee or of its officers, employees, or agents. Such funds, or, in the event of commingling of such funds by licensee or its agent with those of the licensee or its agent, an amount of funds of such licensee or of its agent equal thereto, shall constitute trust funds as herein provided and shall not be subject to attachment, levy of execution or sequestration by order of court except by a payee, or bona fide assignee, or bona fide holder in due course of a check, draft, or money order sold by a licensee, or except by an obligor for whom a licensee is acting as an agent in paying bills. Funds in said account, together with funds and checks on hand and in the hands of agents held for the account of the licensee, at all times shall be at least equal to the aggregate liablity of the licensee on account of checks sold and bills, invoices, and accounts accepted for payment.

Upon request of the commissioner, a licensee shall furnish to the commissioner an authorization for examination of financial records of any such trust fund account, maintained in a financial institution, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 7473 of the Government Code.

Nothing in this law shall be construed to prevent a purchaser, a holder in due course, the payee of a check, draft or money order sold by the licensee in the usual course of his business, or an obligor for whom the licensee is acting as an agent in paying bills of the obligor, from taking any legal action necessary to enforce any claims which said purchaser, holder in due course, payee, or obligor may desire to take including the right to levy attachment or execution.

In the event a license under this law shall be suspended or terminated the licensee shall immediately deposit in said trust account an amount which with funds therein contained shall be equal to the outstanding checks sold and bills unpaid.



######### 12300.4.  
Prior to such separation and transmittal to the licensee or deposit by its agent such funds received by said agent may be used by said agent for the sole purpose only of the making of change or cashing of checks in the normal course of its business. All such funds received by said agent to the date of deposit or transmittal as required below or an amount equal to such funds must be separated from those of the agent and transmitted to, or deposited in the trust account of, the licensee not less than every third business day. If an agent owns or operates, either directly or indirectly, more than two locations for the sale of checks, drafts, money orders, or other commercial paper serving the same purpose and/or for the receipt of money for the purpose of paying bills, invoices or accounts of an obligor, and handles trust funds in any three-day period equal to or in excess of securities to be deposited as provided in Section 12223, said agent shall transmit to, or deposit in the trust account of, the licensee directly from each such location of such agent such funds not later than the end of the next business day following receipt; such funds to be in form of cash or checks cashed in the normal course of business only.

Where the total amount of such funds held by an agent does not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) in a calendar week, the commissioner may, in his discretion, by written order permit the agent to transmit or deposit such funds in periods in excess of 3 days but not more than 10 days.

If, after reasonable notice from licensee, an agent shall fail to transmit or deposit the funds, or an amount equal thereto, or to report to the licensee, as herein provided without just cause, or if an agent shall use any of such funds, directly or indirectly, for any purpose other than is permitted herein, licensee shall immediately terminate such agency and within five (5) days thereafter notify the commissioner in writing of the reason for such termination, setting forth the name and address of the agency location. No agent so terminated shall be permitted to become an agent of the licensee or any other licensee except as provided in Section 12301.4 of the Financial Code.



######### 12300.5.  
An amount equal to all such funds received by a licensee shall be separated from the funds of the licensee and deposited in its trust account not later than the end of the next business day following receipt by such licensee. All such funds shall thereafter remain in such trust account and may be used for no purpose other than paying bills of said persons, or paying checks, drafts, money orders, or other commercial paper sold by the licensee except as otherwise provided in Section 12300.6.



######### 12300.6.  
Prior to separation and deposit by the licensee such funds may only be used by the licensee for the making of change or the cashing of checks in the normal course of its business, and then only to the extent of the amount of the bond which has been filed under Section 12206.

After separation and deposit such funds also may be used by a licensee for the cashing of checks in the normal course of its business, and then only to the extent of the amount of the bond which has been filed with the commissioner containing the provisions and conditions set forth in Sections 12207 through 12213, inclusive, of this code.



######### 12301.  
A licensee may establish branch offices or agencies if it is qualified under the provisions of Section 12205 and if it expressly assumes responsibility for the acts of any person selling checks, drafts, or money orders for the licensee or accepting money in its name or on its behalf at such place of business. There shall be posted in a prominent place in each branch office or agency a sign stating that the place of business is a branch office or agency of the licensee. The licensee is responsible for the acts of any person selling checks, drafts, or money orders or accepting money in its name or on its behalf.



######### 12301.1.  
A licensee within 10 days after establishing a mobile unit, a branch office or agency location shall notify the commissioner in writing and shall furnish the commissioner with the name and address of each such branch office or agency location and the California state registration number or other identification of the mobile unit and the area in which it proposes to operate such mobile unit and such other information as the commissioner may require so that he may be continuously advised of every location at which checks, drafts, or money orders of the licensee are being sold or issued. Within five days after the termination of a mobile unit, a branch office or agency location a licensee shall inform the commissioner of the name and address of the branch office or agency location terminated and the California state registration number or other identification of the mobile unit terminated, together with a statement of the reasons for the termination.



######### 12301.2.  
A check, draft, or money order sold by a licensee shall be drawn on an account of a licensee maintained at a bank authorized to do business in the State of California.



######### 12301.3.  
A licensee shall not permit any officer, employee, or agent to sell any check, draft, or money order unless the signature of the person signing the same is on file with the bank on which the check, draft, or money order is drawn or the licensee shall have filed with the bank and the commissioner written authorization to said bank to pay any checks, drafts, or money orders presented for payment on a form of the licensee as described in the authorization except as to items as to which licensee has filed a stop payment notice with said bank.



######### 12301.4.  
A licensee shall terminate and cancel any agency immediately upon instruction from the commissioner and when it has been established (a) that the agent has refused to permit the examination of its books, accounts, records, and files; (b) that an examination has revealed a shortage in its accounts relating to the sale of checks; (c) that the agent after specific instruction to do so has failed to remit to the licensee or deposit in its trust account within the time specified in Section 12300.4 funds received from the sale of checks, drafts, money orders, or other commercial paper serving the same purpose or funds received for the purpose of paying bills, invoices, or accounts of an obligor; (d) that the agency has violated any provision of this chapter. No agency terminated and canceled by a licensee pursuant to or for the reasons set forth in this section shall be re-established by said licensee or established by any other licensee until after the written consent of the commissioner is given to the establishment or re-establishment of such agency. If the licensee or the agent requests a hearing with respect to such termination, the commissioner shall thereupon hold a hearing within 10 days after receiving such request. If the commissioner finds that the violations were purely technical and do not substantially affect the agent’s ability to perform his duties as such agent, or if the commissioner finds that such violations did not occur, the commissioner shall issue an order vacating his said notice to the licensee.



######### 12301.5.  
No agent of a licensee shall issue or cause to be issued any check, draft, or money order, or other commercial paper serving the same purpose which is drawn upon the trust account of a licensee without concurrently receiving in full, in cash, or by check, draft, or money order from a third party believed to be valid, the principal amount thereof.



######### 12302.  
Whenever a licensee desires to change his place of business to a street address other than that designated in his license or desires to change the place or area of doing business in the case of a mobile unit, he shall give written notice to the commissioner of the desired change.



######### 12303.  
Every licensee shall keep and use in his business books, accounts and records in accordance with good accounting practice and which will enable the commissioner to determine whether such licensee has violated the provisions of this division or the rules and regulations made by the commissioner. Every licensee shall preserve such books, accounts and records for at least four years after making the final entry on each transaction recorded therein. Such books, accounts and records shall be kept current, shall be maintained at the main office of the licensee and shall be available for inspection by the commissioner on demand during regular business hours.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any licensee to keep an individual record of each individual fee charged in each transaction but the licensee shall be required to keep a record of the total charges made for any accounting period.

(a) Each licensee, except a special prorater, shall submit to the commissioner, at such licensee’s own expense, an audit report containing audited financial statements covering the calendar year or, if such licensee has an established fiscal year, then for such fiscal year, within 105 days after the close of each such calendar or fiscal year. At such time, each licensee shall also file such additional relevant information as the commissioner may require.

(b) Within 30 days after receipt of a request from the commissioner, a licensee or other person subject to this division shall submit to the commissioner, at such person’s own expense, an audit report containing audited financial statements covering the 12 calendar months next preceding the month of receipt of the request, or such other period as the commissioner may require. Unless the public interest shall otherwise require, the commissioner shall exempt a licensee from the provisions of subdivision (a) hereof, in whole or in part, if such licensee has complied with a request pursuant to this subdivision (b) for financial statements as of a date within the calendar or fiscal year for which such exemption is granted.

(c) A licensee whose license has been surrendered or revoked shall submit to the commissioner, at its own expense, on or before 105 days after the effective date of such surrender or revocation, a closing audit report containing audited financial statements as of such effective date for the 12 months ending with such effective date, or for such other period as the commissioner may specify.

(i) The commissioner may reject any financial statement, report, certificate or opinion filed pursuant to this section by notifying the licensee or other person required to make such filing of its rejection and the cause thereof. Within 30 days after the receipt of such notice, the licensee or other person shall correct such deficiency, and the failure so to do shall be deemed a violation of this division. The commissioner shall retain a copy of all filings so rejected. 

(j) The commissioner may make rules and regulations specifying the form and content of the reports and financial statements referred to in this section, and may require that such reports and financial statements be verified by the licensee in such manner as he may prescribe.



######### 12305.

######### 12306.  
The cost of every examination of a licensee or other person subject to this division shall be paid to the commissioner by the licensee or person examined, and the commissioner may maintain an action for the recovery of these costs in any court of competent jurisdiction. In determining the cost of an examination, the commissioner may use the estimated average hourly cost for all persons performing examinations of licensees or other persons subject to this division for the fiscal year. For the purposes of this section only, no person other than a licensee shall be deemed to be a person subject to this division unless and until the person is determined to be a person subject to this division by an administrative hearing in accordance with Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code or by a judicial hearing in any court of competent jurisdiction.

######### 12307.2.  
If the commissioner finds as a result of an examination or report that a licensee is insolvent or has been insolvent or is conducting or has conducted business in such an unsafe or injurious manner as to render its further operations hazardous to the public, the commissioner may forthwith by an order addressed to and served on the licensee by registered mail and on any other person having funds of the licensee or its customers in their possession, direct discontinuance of the disbursement of such funds and the further conduct of business by the licensee. The order shall be conditioned to remain in effect unless the commissioner fails to hold a hearing within 15 days after receipt of a written request by the licensee, until set aside by the commissioner in whole or in part, until the licensee is the subject of an order for relief in bankruptcy, or pursuant to a petition filed by the commissioner or other interested person a receiver has been appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction.

While in possession of the property and business of a check seller, a receiver shall have the same powers and authority as are vested in the Commissioner of Financial Institutions while in possession of the property and business of a bank.



######### 12307.5.  
(a) For any licensee, a disciplinary action taken by the State of California, another state, an agency of the federal government, or another country for an action substantially related to the activity regulated under this division may be grounds for disciplinary action by the commissioner. A certified copy of the record of the disciplinary action taken against the licensee by the State of California, other state, agency of the federal government, or other country shall be conclusive evidence of the events related therein.

(b) Nothing in this section shall preclude the commissioner from applying a specific statutory provision in this division providing for discipline against a licensee as a result of disciplinary action taken against a licensee by the State of California, another state, an agency of the federal government, or another country.

#### DIVISION 4. AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINES: USER SAFETY [13000 - 13070]  


##### CHAPTER 1. Intent [13000- 13000.]  

######### 13000.  
It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this division to enhance the safety of consumers using automated teller machines in California without discouraging the siting of automated teller machines in locations convenient to consumers’ homes and workplaces. Since decisions concerning safety at automated teller machine sites are inherently subjective and because safety is a relative matter, the Legislature intends to establish as the standard of care applicable to operators of automated teller machines, in connection with user safety, the substantial compliance with the objective standards of Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 13040), the information requirements of Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 13050), and the good faith consideration of other safety issues as prescribed in Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 13030). The Legislature further recognizes the need for uniformity as to the establishment of automated teller machine safety standards and intends with this division to supersede and preempt any rule, regulation, code, statute, or ordinance of any city, county, city and county, municipality, or local agency regarding customer safety at automated teller machines in California.







##### CHAPTER 2. Definitions [13020- 13020.]  

######### 13020.  
As used in this division:

(a) “Access area” means any paved walkway or sidewalk which is within 50 feet of an automated teller machine. The term does not include publicly maintained sidewalks or roads, as defined in Section 555 or Section 527 of the Vehicle Code.

(b) “Access device” shall have the same meaning as set forth in Federal Reserve Board Regulation E (12 C.F.R. Part 205), promulgated pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).

(c) “Automated teller machine” means any electronic information processing device located in California which accepts or dispenses cash in connection with a credit, deposit, or convenience account. The term does not include devices used solely to facilitate check guarantees or check authorizations, or which are used in connection with the acceptance or dispensing of cash on a person-to-person basis, such as by a store cashier.

(d) “Candlefoot power” means the light intensity of candles on a horizontal plane at 36 inches above ground level and five feet in front of the area to be measured.

(e) “Control” of an access area or defined parking area means to have the present authority to determine how, when, and by whom it is to be used, and how it is to be maintained, lighted, and landscaped.

(f) “Customer” means a natural person to whom an access device has been issued for personal, family, or household use.

(g) “Defined parking area” means that portion of any parking area open for customer parking which is (1) contiguous to an access area with respect to an automated teller machine; (2) regularly, principally, and lawfully used for parking by users of the automated teller machine while conducting automated teller machine transactions during hours of darkness; and (3) owned or leased by the operator of the automated teller machine or owned or controlled by the party leasing the automated teller machine site to the operator. The term does not include any parking area which is not open or regularly used for parking by users of the automated teller machine who are conducting automated teller machine transactions during hours of darkness. A parking area is not open if it is physically closed to access or if conspicuous signs indicate that it is closed. If a multiple level parking area satisfies the conditions of this subdivision and would therefore otherwise be a defined parking area, only the single parking level deemed by the operator of the automated teller machine to be the most directly accessible to the users of the automated teller machine shall be a defined parking area.

(h) “Hours of darkness” means the period that commences 30 minutes after sunset and ends 30 minutes before sunrise.

(i) “Operator” means any bank, savings association, credit union, industrial loan company, savings bank, or other business entity, or any person who operates an automated teller machine.







##### CHAPTER 3. Location and Installation [13030 - 13031]  

######### 13030.  
On or before July 1, 1991, with respect to all existing installed automated teller machines in this state, and any automated teller machines installed after July 1, 1991, the operator shall adopt procedures for evaluating the safety of the automated teller machine. These procedures shall include a consideration of the following:

(a) The extent to which the lighting for the automated teller machine complies or will comply with the standards required by Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 13040).

(b) The presence of landscaping, vegetation, or other obstructions in the area of the automated teller machine, the access area, and the defined parking area. 

(c) The incidence of crimes of violence in the immediate neighborhood of the automated teller machine, as reflected in the records of the local law enforcement agency and of which the operator has actual knowledge.



######### 13031.  
It is not the intent of the Legislature in enacting this chapter to impose a duty to relocate or modify automated teller machines upon the occurrence of any particular events or circumstances, but rather to establish a standard of good faith for the evaluation of all automated teller machines as provided herein.







##### CHAPTER 4. Lighting [13040 - 13041]  

######### 13040.  
(a) Each operator of an automated teller machine installed on or after July 1, 1991, shall comply with Section 13041 commencing on the date the automated teller machine is installed. Compliance with Section 13041 by operators as to automated teller machines existing as of July 1, 1991, shall be optional until July 1, 1993, and mandatory thereafter. This subdivision shall apply to an operator of an automated teller machine only to the extent that the operator controls the access area or defined parking area to be lighted.

(b) If an access area or a defined parking area is not controlled by the operator of the automated teller machine, and if the person who leased the automated teller machine site to the operator controls the access area or defined parking area, the person who controls the access area or defined parking area shall comply with Section 13041 as to any automated teller machine installed on or after July 1, 1991, commencing on the date the automated teller machine is installed; and as to any automated teller machine existing as of July 1, 1991, no later than on July 1, 1993.



######### 13041.

(a) There shall be a minimum of 10 candlefoot power at the face of the automated teller machine and extending in an unobstructed direction outward five feet. 

(b) There shall be a minimum of two candlefoot power within 50 feet from all unobstructed directions from the face of the automated teller machine. In the event the automated teller machine is located within 10 feet of the corner of the building and the automated teller machine is generally accessible from the adjacent side, there shall be minimum of two candlefoot power along the first 40 unobstructed feet of the adjacent side of the building.

(c) There shall be a minimum of two candlefoot power in that portion of the defined parking area within 60 feet of the automated teller machine.







##### CHAPTER 5. Consumer Education [13050- 13050.]  

######### 13050.  
Customers receiving access devices shall be furnished by the respective issuers thereof with notices of basic safety precautions which customers should employ while using an automated teller machine. This information shall be furnished by personally delivering or by mailing the information to each customer whose mailing address as to the account to which the access device relates is in this state. This information shall be furnished with respect to access devices issued on or after July 1, 1991, at or before the time the customer is furnished with his or her access device. With respect to a customer to whom an “accepted access device” (as defined in Federal Reserve Board Regulation E) has been issued prior to July 1, 1991, the information shall be delivered or mailed to the customer on or before December 31, 1991. Only one notice need be furnished per household, and if access devices are furnished to more than one customer for a single account or set of accounts or on the basis of a single application or other request for the access devices, only a single notice need be furnished in satisfaction of the notification responsibilities as to all those customers. The information may be included with other disclosures related to the access device furnished to the customer, such as with any initial or periodic disclosure statement furnished pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act.







##### CHAPTER 6. Exemptions [13060- 13060.]  

######### 13060.  
The provisions of this division shall not apply with respect to any automated teller machine which is:

(a) Located inside of a building, unless it is a freestanding installation which exists for the sole purpose of providing an enclosure for the automated teller machine.

(b) Located inside of a building, except to the extent a transaction can be conducted from outside the building.

(c) Located in any area, including any access area, building, enclosed space, or parking area which is not controlled by the operator.







##### CHAPTER 7. Effect of Compliance [13070- 13070.]  

######### 13070.  
This division supersedes and preempts all rules, regulations, codes, statutes, or ordinances of all cities, counties, cities and counties, municipalities, and local agencies regarding customer safety at automated teller machines located in California.






##### DIVISION 4.5. AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINE SURCHARGE DISCLOSURE [13080 - 13083]  

######### 13080.  
(a) No operator of an automated teller machine (ATM) in this state shall impose any surcharge upon a customer for the usage of that machine whether or not the customer is using an access device issued by that operator unless that surcharge is clearly disclosed to the customer electronically on the automated teller machine. Unless the disclosure is made prior to the customer being obligated to pay the surcharge, the customer shall be provided an opportunity to cancel that transaction without incurring any surcharge. This subdivision does not apply to a point of sale transaction at an ATM.

(b) If the sale of a good or service is conducted at the ATM, the operator of that ATM shall disclose to the customer electronically on the ATM the total price of the good or service and any fee charged solely for the usage of the ATM. Unless the disclosure is made prior to the customer being obligated to pay for the good or service, the customer shall be provided with an opportunity to cancel the transaction without incurring any obligation.

(c) If a surcharge is imposed on a customer using an access device not issued by the operator, the operator shall disclose that the customer may also be charged an additional fee by his or her own institution.

(d) As used in this section, “operator,” “automated teller machine,” “customer,” and “access device” have the meanings set forth in Section 13020. The term “surcharge” means any charge imposed by the operator of the ATM solely for use of the ATM. The term “service” includes, but is not limited to, receiving a statement of account activity.



######### 13081.  
(a) In enacting this section, the Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(1) It is in the best interest of consumers in this state to be aware of fees they may be charged for using point-of-sale devices prior to being obligated to pay those fees.

(2) In 1996, the Legislature enacted Assembly Bill 3366 (Chapter 98 of the Statutes of 1996), which required operators of automatic teller machines (ATMs) to electronically disclose fees for transactions at those ATMs. That legislation did not require disclosure of fees at point-of-sale devices.

(3) In order to maximize consumer awareness of fees at point-of-sale devices, and to create equity between operators of ATMs and operators of point-of-sale devices, it is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to require the maximum feasible disclosure of fees at point-of-sale devices.

(b) No operator of a point-of-sale device in this state shall impose any fee upon a customer for the use of that device unless that fee is disclosed to the customer prior to the customer being obligated to pay for any goods or services. That disclosure shall be placed on or at the point-of-sale device as follows:

(1) For all point-of-sale devices, the fee disclosure shall be on a label meeting federal standards.

(2) For point-of-sale devices purchased on or after January 1, 2001, that have electronic displays, the fee disclosure shall also be electronic.

######### 13082.  
(a) Whenever a point-of-sale system is changed or modified to include a video touch screen or any other nontactile keypad, the point-of-sale device that would include the video touch screen or nontactile keypad shall also be equipped with either of the following:

(1) A tactually discernible numerical keypad similar to a telephone keypad containing a raised dot with a dot base diameter between 1.5 millimeters and 1.6 millimeters and a height between 0.6 millimeters and 0.9 millimeters on the number 5 key that enables a visually impaired person to enter his or her own personal identification number or any other personal information necessary to process the transaction in a manner that provides the opportunity for the same degree of privacy input and output available to all individuals.

(2) Other technology, such as a radio frequency identification device, fingerprint biometrics, or some other mechanism that enables a visually impaired person to access the video touch screen device with his or her personal identifier and to process his or her transaction in a manner that provides the opportunity for the same degree of privacy input and output available to all individuals.

(b) (1) On or before January 1, 2010, any existing point-of-sale system, except as provided in paragraph (2), that includes a video touch screen or any other nontactile keypad shall also be equipped with a tactually discernable keypad or other technology as described in subdivision (a).

(2) At locations equipped with two or less point-of-sale machines, only one point-of-sale machine shall be required to be equipped with a tactually discernible keypad or other technology on or before January 1, 2010, as described in subdivision (a).

(c) On and after January 1, 2006, a manufacturer or distributor shall be required to offer for availability touch screen or other nontactile point-of-sale devices to be used and sold in this state that are equipped with tactually discernible keypads or other technology as described in subdivision (a) that enable a visually impaired person to enter his or her own personal identification number or any other personal information necessary to process a transaction in a manner that ensures personal privacy of the information being entered.

(d) As used in this section, “point-of-sale device” includes any device used by a customer for the purchase of a good or service where a personal identification number (PIN) is required, but does not include the following:

(1) An automated teller machine as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 13020.

(2) A point-of-sale device that is equipped to, or exclusively services, motor fuel dispensers.

(e) A unit is not in compliance with this section unless it includes a device, whether internal or external to the unit, that does not lend itself to easy removal, allows visually impaired users easy access, and otherwise meets the terms and conditions of this section. If the device is freestanding, it shall be permanently attached to the unit by means of a braided wire or some other tether.

(f) This section shall not be construed to preclude or limit any other existing right or remedy as it pertains to point-of-sale devices and accessibility.



######### 13083.  
(a) Subject to the requirements of Section 13080, an agreement to operate or share an automated teller machine may not prohibit, limit, or restrict the right of the operator or owner of the automated teller machine to charge a customer conducting a transaction using an account from a financial institution that is located outside the United States an access fee or surcharge not otherwise prohibited under state or federal law.

(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit or otherwise limit the ability of an operator or owner of an automated teller machine to voluntarily enter into an agreement regarding participation in a surcharge free network.

(c) For purposes of this section, the terms “operator” and “automated teller machine” have the meanings set forth in Section 13020.

(d) For the purposes of this section, the term “owner” means any entity that is not an operator under Section 13020, but that owns an automated teller machine.

(1) A person who has purchased or who has agreed to purchase the membership. 

(2) A creditor or creditors of the credit union who extended or continued credit or contracted to perform services to the corporation in consideration of the proxy if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of the extension or continuation of credit or services and the name of the person extending or continuing the credit or performing the service.

In addition to paragraphs (1) through (3), a proxy of a member may be made irrevocable notwithstanding subdivision (c) if it is given to secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either legal or equitable, until the happening of events which by its terms, discharge the obligations secured by it.

(e) Subdivision (a) notwithstanding:

(1) No amendment of the articles or bylaws repealing, restricting, creating or expanding proxy rights may be adopted without approval by the members.

(2) No amendment of the articles or bylaws restricting or limiting the use of proxies may affect the validity of a previously issued irrevocable proxy during the term of its irrevocability, so long as it complied with applicable provisions, if any, of the articles or bylaws at the time of issuance, and is otherwise valid under this section.

(f) Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, any revocable proxy covering matters requiring a vote of the members pursuant to Section 7222, Section 7224, Section 7233, Section 7812, paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 7911, Section 8012, subdivision (a) of Section 8015, Section 8610, or subdivision (a) of Section 8719 of the Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law, Part 3 (commencing with Section 7110) of Division 2 of Title 1 of the Corporations Code, or subdivision (e) is not valid as to such matters unless it sets forth the general nature of the matter to be voted on.



######### 14821.  
(a) Except for solicited proxies which on their face provide for a period of validity of three years from the date of execution of the proxy, any form of proxy or written ballot distributed to 10 or more members of a credit union shall afford an opportunity on the proxy or form of written ballot to specify at the time the written ballot or proxy is distributed, a choice between approval and disapproval of each matter or group of related matters intended to be acted upon at the meeting for which the proxy is solicited or by such written ballot, and shall provide, subject to reasonable specified conditions, that where the person solicited specifies a choice with respect to any such matter the vote shall be cast in accordance therewith.

(b) In any election of directors, any form of proxy or written ballot in which the directors to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which is marked by a member “withhold” or otherwise marked in a manner indicating that the authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld, shall not be voted either for or against the election of a director.

(c) In the case of any solicited proxy which on its face provides for a period of validity of three years from the date of execution of the proxy, the credit union shall provide to the person executing the proxy a written notice at the time of solicitation and in each succeeding year of validity thereof, which shall advise the member of the nature of each matter or group of related matters on which the proxy may be voted. Notice pursuant to this subdivision may be sent with notice to the members of the date, time, and place of the annual meeting.

(d) Failure to comply with this section shall not invalidate any corporate action taken, but may be the basis for challenging any proxy at a meeting or written ballot and the superior court may compel compliance therewith at the suit of any member.



######### 14822.  
Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, no member shall vote by proxy on any matter submitted by mail to all members of a credit union in a written ballot pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 7510) of Part 3 of Division 2 of Title 1 of the Corporations Code, and the powers of any previously issued or outstanding valid, revocable proxy are suspended when any matter is submitted by mail to all members in a written ballot pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 7510) of Part 3 of Division 2 of Title 1 of the Corporations Code.

An obligation or extension of credit made pursuant to this subdivision shall not be deemed a violation of subdivision (b) of Section 14800. Except as otherwise permitted by statute or regulation, the credit union shall not extend any other benefit or service of the credit union to the nonmember solely as a result of participation as a joint applicant, co-obligor, coborrower, surety, or guarantor unless the nonmember is thereafter admitted to membership.

(b) If the security offered is an endorsed note as provided in subdivision (a) of Section 14955, a signed and dated financial statement shall be taken from each person who endorses the note and the sufficiency of the financial responsibility of every such endorser shall be verified by a majority of the credit committee. Obligations secured by the signatures of a borrower and endorser or endorsers shall not exceed the amount that may be extended to the borrower without security pursuant to Section 15100, plus an equivalent amount for each endorser; plus the amount of shares or certificates for funds pledged to secure the obligation.

(c) A loan purchase that is authorized by this section shall not be an obligation with a nonmember within the meaning of Section 14750.



######### 14960.

#### CHAPTER 9. Merger, Dissolution and Conversion [15200 - 15359]  


##### ARTICLE 1. Merger [15200 - 15204]  

######### 15200.  
Any credit union may, with the approval of the commissioner, merge with another credit union or with a central credit union.



######### 15201.  
(a) The merger shall be made pursuant to any plan agreed upon by the majority of the board of directors of each credit union joining in the merger, and approved by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the members of the disappearing credit union, in person or by proxy, at a meeting of the members called for that purpose or by written consent of a majority of the members of the disappearing credit union. Notice of the meeting shall be given to the members, either personally or by first-class mail, not less than 30 nor more than 90 days prior to the date of the meeting.

(b) The commissioner may approve a merger according to the plan agreed upon by the majority of the board of directors of each credit union, as set forth in subdivision (a), if the plan of merger is approved by less than a majority of the membership as provided in subdivision (a) if the commissioner finds, upon the written and verified application filed by the board of directors, that (1) notice of the meeting called to consider the merger or the ballot for written vote on the merger was mailed to each member entitled to vote upon the question, (2) the notice or ballot disclosed the purpose of the meeting or the written vote, (3) the notice or ballot informed the membership that approval of the merger might be sought pursuant to this section, and (4) a majority of the votes cast upon the question were in favor of the merger.

(c) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), the commissioner may approve a merger without a vote of the membership of the disappearing credit union if a majority of the members of the board of directors of the surviving credit union approves the merger, the disappearing credit union is in danger of insolvency and the merger would reduce the risk or avoid a threatened loss to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund or other form of share guaranty or insurance that is acceptable to the commissioner. For purposes of this chapter, a credit union is insolvent when, from the most recent available financial statements, it can be shown that the total amount of its shares exceeds the present cash value of its assets after providing for liabilities unless the commissioner finds all of the following:

(1) The facts that caused the deficient share-asset ratio no longer exist.

(2) Further decline in the share-asset ratio is not probable.

(3) The return of the share-asset ratio to its normal limits within a reasonable time for the credit union concerned is probable.

(4) The probability of a further potential loss is negligible to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund or other form of share guaranty or insurance that is acceptable to the commissioner.



######### 15202.  
(a) After the requirement of approval as provided in Section 15201 is satisfied, each credit union shall execute a certificate of merger as an officers’ certificate pursuant to Section 5062 of the Corporations Code that shall set forth:

(1) That the plan of merger has been approved by the board of directors.

(2) That the plan of merger has been duly approved by any required vote of the members pursuant to Section 15201.

(3) The total number of members of the credit union.

(b) A copy of the plan of merger and of the written approval thereof by the commissioner shall be annexed to the certificate of merger. 

(c) Nothing in this section requires a federal credit union to execute or file the certificate of merger called for in subdivision (a).



######### 15203.  
Each certificate of merger called for in Section 15202 shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State. After the filing in the office of the Secretary of State, a copy of each certificate of merger, certified by the Secretary of State, shall be filed with the commissioner, and at that time the merger shall become effective for all purposes.



######### 15204.  
(a) Upon any merger effectuated as provided in this article, all property, property rights, and interests of the merged credit union shall vest in the surviving credit union, without deed, endorsement or other instruments of transfer, and all debts, obligations and liabilities of the merged credit union are assumed by the surviving credit union under whose charter the merger has been effected. Thereafter the charter of the merged credit union is void, and the existence of the merged credit union as a legal entity separate from the surviving credit union terminates.

(b) Whenever a credit union having any real property in this state merges with another credit union and vests that real property in the surviving credit union, the filing for record in the office of the county recorder of any county in this state in which any of the real property of the disappearing credit union is located of the certificates of merger and requisite attachments, as required by Section 15202, shall evidence record ownership in the surviving credit union of all interest of the disappearing credit union in and to the real property located in that county.








##### ARTICLE 2. Dissolution [15250 - 15260]  

######### 15250.  
(a) Whenever the board of directors of a credit union recommends by a vote of a majority of all its members the dissolution of the credit union, the members of the credit union, at any meeting specially called to consider the subject, may elect to dissolve the credit union, by the vote or written consent of a majority of all members of the credit union.

(b) The commissioner may approve the dissolution of a credit union which is recommended by the vote of a majority of the board members of the credit union, even if the dissolution is approved by less than a majority of all members of the credit union, if the commissioner finds, upon the written and verified application filed by the board of directors, that (1) notice of the meeting called to consider the dissolution or the written ballot for written vote on the dissolution was mailed to each member entitled to vote upon the question, (2) the notice or the written ballot disclosed the purpose of the meeting or the written vote and informed the membership that approval of the dissolution might be sought pursuant to this section, and (3) a majority of the votes cast upon the question were in favor of the dissolution.

(c) Whenever the members of the board of directors vote to recommend the dissolution of any credit union, the credit union shall not make any loans, withdrawal of shares, or withdrawal of certificates for funds until the members approve or disapprove the recommendation of the board of directors.



######### 15251.  
If the dissolution of the credit union is approved pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 15250, the board of directors of the credit union shall elect a committee of three members or may by resolution appoint a liquidating agent to liquidate the assets of the credit union. If the commissioner is appointed liquidating agent, the commissioner may act as liquidating agent or appoint the National Credit Union Administration or other person to act as liquidating agent. Whenever the commissioner is appointed liquidating agent, the credit union shall surrender its certificate to act as a credit union.



######### 15252.  
Promptly thereafter the president or vice president and secretary or assistant secretary, or a majority of the committee or the liquidating agent in charge of liquidation, shall sign and verify a certificate stating that the credit union has elected to wind up and dissolve and showing by what vote or consent such election was made. The certificate shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State, and copies of the certificate certified by the Secretary of State shall be filed with the commissioner.



######### 15253.  
After a vote to dissolve a credit union no business may be carried on by the credit union except in the proper course of liquidation.



######### 15254.  
The committee or the liquidating agent in charge of liquidation may sue in the name and on behalf of the credit union, and may sell or otherwise dispose of the assets of the credit union, in whole or in part, at public or private sale.



######### 15255.  
After determining that all known debts and liabilities of the credit union have been paid or adequately provided for, the committee or the liquidating agent in charge of liquidation shall distribute all the remaining assets of the credit union among the members or shareholders. Each share is entitled to its proportionate amount of the assets according to the amount paid on that share.



######### 15257.  
When a credit union has completely wound up, all of its known debts and liabilities actually paid or adequately provided for or paid as far as its assets permit, and its known assets distributed, a majority of the committee or the liquidating agent in charge of liquidation shall sign and acknowledge a certificate stating that the credit union has been completely wound up, its known assets distributed, any tax or penalty due under the Bank and Corporation Franchise Tax Law paid, and its other known debts and liabilities actually paid or adequately provided for or paid as far as its assets permit and that the credit union is dissolved.



######### 15258.  
The certificate of dissolution shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State and copies, certified by him, shall be filed in the office of the commissioner.



######### 15259.  
At any time during the liquidation process, the committee or the liquidating agent in charge of liquidation may be relieved of their duties at the discretion of the commissioner and the commissioner shall thereafter act as the liquidating agent or appoint a liquidating agent to complete the dissolution of the credit union.



######### 15260.  
Where the commissioner finds that on the date of filing with the Secretary of State of the certificate of election to wind up and dissolve, the credit union does not have sufficient assets to return to its shareholders their investment in full, the credit union shall not be liable for the costs of administration assessed under Article 4 (commencing with Section 14350) of Chapter 3.








##### ARTICLE 3. Conversion Into Federal Credit Unions [15300 - 15306]  

######### 15300.  
A credit union may convert itself into a federal credit union by following the procedure contained in this article.



######### 15301.  
Upon recommendation of the board of directors the members of any credit union may by an affirmative majority vote of such members resolve to convert such credit union into a federal credit union. For the purposes of this article, an “affirmative majority vote of such members” means that the vote by the members to convert the credit union into a federal credit union is approved or ratified by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which affirmative votes also constitute a majority of the required quorum) or written ballot in conformity with Section 7513 of the Corporations Code or by the affirmative vote or written ballot as may be provided in the bylaws pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 7151 of the Corporations Code.



######### 15302.  
Within 10 days after the meeting or written vote at which the members determine to convert into a federal credit union, the credit union shall file with the commissioner a certificate verified by the board of directors of such credit union. The certificate shall contain a copy of the minutes of the meeting or a copy of the written ballot and the results of the written vote and a statement that the members have approved the determination to convert such credit union into a federal credit union. A copy of such certificate shall be filed with the Secretary of State.



######### 15303.  
A certified copy of the certificate required by Section 15302 filed in the office of the Secretary of State is presumptive evidence of the holding of the meeting or written vote and the action taken thereat.



######### 15304.  
After the meeting or the written vote of the members, the credit union shall take such action as is necessary to make it a federal credit union, and within 10 days after receipt of the federal charter, the credit union shall file with the commissioner and with the Secretary of State, a copy of the charter issued to such credit union by the National Credit Union Administration or a certificate showing the organization of such credit union as a federal credit union certified by or on behalf of the National Credit Union Administration. Upon the filing of such instrument with the Secretary of State the credit union ceases to be a state credit union and is a federal credit union.



######### 15305.  
At the time the conversion into a federal credit union becomes effective, the credit union ceases to be supervised by this state and all of the property of the credit union, including all of its right, title, and interest in and to all property of every kind and character immediately, by operation of law and without any conveyance, or transfer and without any further act or deed, is vested in the credit union under its new name and style as a federal credit union and under its new jurisdiction.



######### 15306.  
The converted federal credit union shall have, hold, and enjoy the property mentioned in Section 15305 in its own right as fully and to the same extent as the property was possessed, held, and enjoyed by it as a state credit union and the federal credit union shall continue responsible for all of the obligations of the state credit union to the same extent as though the conversion had not taken place. The federal credit union shall be merely a continuation of the state credit union under a new name and new jurisdiction and such revision of its corporate structure as is considered necessary for its proper operation under the new jurisdiction.








##### ARTICLE 4. Conversion of Federal Credit Union [15350 - 15359]  

######### 15350.  
Upon recommendation of its board of directors, any federal credit union may convert into a credit union under the laws of this state by complying with the requirements of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. Sec. 1771) and on obtaining a certificate pursuant to Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 14100) of this division.



######### 15351.  
The officers and directors of the federal credit union shall be the officers and directors of the credit union after conversion takes effect, to hold office until their successors are elected and qualified.



######### 15352.  
The commissioner may conduct a joint audit of the federal credit union with federal auditors. Upon completion of such audit, he shall issue a certificate to the National Credit Union Administration showing the results of such audit. The commissioner may also certify that the transfer of the assets and liabilities from the federal credit union to a credit union subject to the laws of this state has been effected in compliance with the applicable laws of this state. The costs of the audit mentioned in this section shall constitute a charge against the credit union.



######### 15353.  
Copies of the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting of the members or the written ballot and the record of written vote of the members in which they voted to convert into a state credit union, verified by the board of directors of the credit union, shall be filed within 10 days after the meeting or written vote with the commissioner, and, in duplicate, with the National Credit Union Administration.



######### 15354.  
The verified copies of the minutes of the meeting or the record of written vote, when filed as required by Section 15353, are presumptive evidence of the holding of, and the action taken at, the meeting or the written vote.



######### 15355.  
After an affirmative vote as provided in Section 15350, the federal credit union shall take or cause to be taken such action in the manner prescribed and authorized by this division as shall make it a credit union of this state. The directors shall file the documents and take such proceedings as are required by this division in the case of the original incorporation of a credit union.



######### 15356.  
The directors of a credit union converted from a federal credit union may insert in the articles of incorporation the following statement: “This credit union is incorporated by conversion from a federal credit union.”



######### 15357.  
Within 10 days after the filing of the articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State, there shall be filed, with the National Credit Union Administration, two copies of the articles of incorporation, certified by the Secretary of State.



######### 15358.  
Upon the filing of the articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State and the issuance of a certificate by the commissioner authorizing the federal credit union to act as a credit union under the laws of this state, the credit union ceases to be a federal credit union and is a credit union under the laws of this state. All of the property of the credit union immediately, by operation of law and without any further act, is vested in the credit union under its new name and existence as a credit union under the laws of this state.



######### 15359.  
The converted credit union shall have, hold, and enjoy the property mentioned in Section 15358 in its own right as fully and to the same extent as the property was possessed, held, and enjoyed by it as a federal credit union and the converted credit union continues responsible for all of the obligations of the federal credit union to the same extent as though conversion had not taken place. The converted credit union is merely a continuation of the federal credit union under a new name and new jurisdiction and such revision of its corporate structure as is considered necessary for its proper operation under the new jurisdiction.

The surety under the bond may pay the full amount of its liability thereunder to the commissioner or a conservator appointed by the commissioner pursuant to Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 17621) in lieu of payment to the state or persons having a cause of action against the principal, and upon such payment the surety is completely released from further liability under the bond.



######### 17203.1.

The commissioner shall prescribe the aggregate amount of the bond and the terms during which the bond runs. The sufficiency of the sureties on the bond are at all times subject to the approval of the commissioner. The bond shall be filed in the commissioner’s office.

(b) The commissioner may at any time require an additional bond or surety to be filed when in the commissioner’s opinion any bond then in force is insufficient for any reason.

######### 17206.

Failure to file a new bond within 10 days of the recovery on a bond, or within 10 days after notification of the commissioner that a new bond is required constitutes sufficient grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license.



######### 17207.  
The commissioner shall charge and collect the following fees and assessments:

(3) If payment is not made within 30 days, the commissioner may assess and collect a penalty, in addition to the annual license fee, of 10 percent of the fee for each month or part of a month that the payment is delayed or withheld.

If a member with more than one licensed location suffers a covered loss at more than one location, the deductible shall apply to each location separately in proportion to the amount of the loss suffered at each such licensed location.

(b) Fidelity Corporation shall pay the full amount of any member’s loss to the member or the member’s successor in interest. The member shall be obligated to pay to Fidelity Corporation the amount of the member’s deductible after payment in full of the loss by Fidelity Corporation.

(c) In the event a license is surrendered, suspended, or revoked prior to payment in full by the member of all or any portion of the deductible, the member shall nevertheless be liable to Fidelity Corporation for the amount of the deductible. If the license of the member is surrendered, suspended, or revoked prior to payment in full of the deductible, Fidelity Corporation shall have priority over all other claimants, except the State of California and any conservator or receiver of the member’s estate, against the assets of the licensee, including the bond required under Section 17202.

Fidelity Corporation shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorney’s fees as an item of costs, as provided for in paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) and paragraph (5) of subdivision (c) of Section 1033.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in defending any claim made directly against Fidelity Corporation, not authorized in this division.

(e) If a member fails to pay the deductible within the time set forth in the bylaws of Fidelity Corporation, Fidelity Corporation may bring an action at law or in equity against the member to recover the amount of the deductible. Fidelity Corporation shall recover its reasonable costs and attorney’s fees as an item of costs, as provided for in paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) and paragraph (5) of subdivision (c) of Section 1033.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, provided, that the payment of the costs and attorney’s fees will not cause the member to be in violation of Section 17202, 17202.1, or 17210.

The commissioner may establish rules which are reasonable and necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.








##### ARTICLE 3. Membership Fee and Assessments [17320 - 17324]  

######### 17320.  
Fidelity Corporation shall establish and maintain the following funds for payment of claims and for payment of costs of administration: the membership fund, the operations fund, and the fidelity fund.

(a) An applicant or a licensee shall, at the time an application is filed for a license, pay to Fidelity Corporation a membership fee of three thousand dollars ($3,000) for each location for which a license is applied. If the application is denied, withdrawn, or abandoned, Fidelity Corporation may retain two hundred dollars ($200) from the membership fee to cover costs of administration.

(1) The membership fund shall be reserved for payment of claims which exceed the fidelity fund balance and for payment of extraordinary operational costs.

(2) Any member who, on the effective date of this section, has an account balance which exceeds the three thousand dollars ($3,000) membership fee times the number of its licensed locations shall be credited in a special reserve account for the excess amount. This balance shall be credited against future assessments made pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 17321 in an amount not exceeding four hundred dollars ($400) per licensed location per year. Any member whose account balance is less than three thousand dollars ($3,000) times the number of its licensed locations shall, on or before December 1, 1988, pay to Fidelity Corporation an amount sufficient to allow the member’s account to be maintained at three thousand dollars ($3,000) times the number of licensed locations. Fidelity Corporation shall provide each member with an accounting of the amounts being reserved for the members’ membership account and amounts being held as a special reserve.

(3) The membership fee, less any unpaid assessments and related costs, shall be refunded to the member in accordance with Fidelity Corporation’s bylaws not less than 30 months and no more than 36 months after the effective date of surrender of a license.

(4) Any member who does not engage in any escrow transactions pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 17312 may terminate its membership in Fidelity Corporation by written notice to Fidelity Corporation and the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, as provided in the Fidelity Corporation’s bylaws and rules and regulations. The membership fee, less any unpaid assessments and related costs, shall be refunded to the member in accordance with Fidelity Corporation’s bylaws not less than 30 months and no more than 36 months after the effective date of the member’s written request to terminate its membership in Fidelity Corporation. Before a licensee resumes those escrow transactions, it shall first be required to become a member of Fidelity Corporation, as provided in this subdivision.

(b) Fidelity Corporation shall prepare, prior to its fiscal year end, an estimated annual operational budget projecting the costs of operations and administration for the succeeding fiscal year, excluding the amount paid for claims and premiums paid for excess coverage bonding. The amount of the assessment shall be 150 percent of the budgetary projection. In succeeding years, the assessment shall be adjusted by adding the prior year’s deficit or deducting unused surplus from the prior year.

(c) Fidelity Corporation shall establish a fidelity fund for the payment of claims and for the payment of the premium for the fidelity bond or insurance policy, if any. All claims shall be paid from the fidelity fund, provided that, to the extent that the fidelity fund balance is not sufficient to pay claims, the claim shall be paid from the membership fund by charging each member’s membership account a pro rata share of the excess.

(d) All interest earned on the membership fund and the operations fund shall be credited to the fidelity fund.



######### 17321.  
Fidelity Corporation shall bill and collect from each member an annual premium that in the aggregate shall consist of assessments for the operations fund and the fidelity fund.

(a) The annual assessment for the operations fund shall be assessed no later than October 15 of each year for the current fiscal year in accordance with subdivision (b) of Section 17320. The payment of any invoice for assessments under this subdivision is payable by the member escrow agent in three equal and consecutive monthly installments with the first installment payable at or within 30 days after receipt of the Fidelity Corporation invoice. The assessment shall include:

(1) All costs and expenses of administration as budgeted by the board of directors for the current fiscal year.

(2) Any expenses actually incurred in the preceding fiscal year which exceeded the budgeted costs of expenses and administration except for expenses recovered pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 17321.1.

Each member’s assessment shall be determined pro rata based upon the ratio of each member’s licensed locations to the total licensed locations of all members as of the preceding June 30.

Members licensed on or after July 1 of each year shall be assessed only for costs and expenses pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision. This assessment shall be prorated on a monthly basis.

(b) The annual assessment for the fidelity fund shall be assessed no later than May 1. The assessment shall include any amount necessary to replenish the membership fund pursuant to Section 17324, and shall be based upon the balances of the membership fund and the fidelity fund as of December 31 of the previous year and the escrow liability schedule of each licensed location as provided in Section 17348, and shall be calculated as follows:

(1) If the membership fund and fidelity fund in the aggregate equal an amount less than five million dollars ($5,000,000), or if the balance in the fidelity fund is less than two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000), then the assessment shall be the greater of: (A) the amount necessary to bring the membership fund and fidelity fund in the aggregate up to five million dollars ($5,000,000), but not to exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000) per assessment, or (B) the amount necessary to maintain a minimum fidelity fund balance of two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000), including the amount of the assessment, or (C) four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000).

(2) If the membership fund and fidelity fund in the aggregate equal an amount that is at least five million dollars ($5,000,000), and the balance in the fidelity fund is at least two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000), then the assessment shall be four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000).

Each member’s fidelity fund assessment for paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be the amount derived by multiplying the amount to be assessed by the ratio that each member’s risk factors bear to the total of all members’ risk factors.

A member’s risk factors shall be computed in accordance with the following formula, except that the total factors of a member shall be reduced by one for each licensed branch location:

(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), the assessment for the fidelity fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1989, shall be made immediately upon 90-day notice of cancellation of the fidelity bond or insurance policy permitted by paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 17310, but in no event later than 60 days prior to the date of cancellation.

(d) Every licensed member as of March 31 shall pay the fidelity fund assessment, without any pro rata adjustment, notwithstanding that the member may have surrendered a license or have a license revoked prior to the date that the assessment is mailed.



######### 17321.1.  
Fidelity Corporation shall levy a special assessment against its members whenever:

(a) Deemed necessary by the board of directors in the event of any extraordinary expenses which would seriously deplete the resources of the operations fund; or

(b) A proof of loss has been submitted by a member which, if paid during that fiscal year, would reduce the membership fund by 10 percent or more.



######### 17321.2.  
Fidelity Corporation shall be entitled to collect late fees as specified in Fidelity Corporation’s bylaws for any late payment of assessments under Section 17320, 17321, or 17321.1.



######### 17322.  
Fidelity Corporation shall report to the commissioner each levy of assessment within 10 business days after the levy.



######### 17323.  
(a) In the event any member fails to pay an assessment when due, Fidelity Corporation shall by written demand addressed to the member request the payment of the assessment within 30 days of the demand letter. If the member fails to pay an assessment, the commissioner may issue an order pursuant to subdivision (b).

(b) If a member fails to pay the assessment, or any applicable late fee, the commissioner may by order summarily suspend the license issued to the company. If after the order is made, a request for a hearing is filed in writing and a hearing is not held within 60 days thereafter, the order is deemed rescinded as of its effective date. During any period when its license is suspended, a company shall not conduct business pursuant to this division, except as may be permitted by order of the commissioner. However, the suspension of a license shall not affect the powers of the commissioner as provided in this division.

(c) Fidelity Corporation may bring an action at law or in equity against the member to recover any assessment or fees.

(d) Fidelity Corporation may be awarded costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, if it prevails in any action against a member, or against a third party, except the commissioner, to enforce a claim against the bond or other security posted by the member pursuant to Section 17202, or in any action against a member pursuant to subdivision (c). Those costs and attorney’s fees may be awarded as an item of costs, as provided for in paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) and paragraph (5) of subdivision (c) of Section 1033.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, provided that the payment of the costs and attorney’s fees will not cause the member to be in violation of Section 17202, 17202.1, or 17210.



######### 17324.  
Any reduction in the membership fund caused by payment of an extraordinary expense pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 17320 or payment of claims pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 17320 shall be replenished by the operations fund or the fidelity fund, as appropriate. The next assessment for the operations fund or the fidelity fund, as appropriate, shall include an amount necessary for that replenishment.








##### ARTICLE 4. General Provisions [17330 - 17350]

A DISPUTE AS TO WHETHER THE DENIAL OF THIS CERTIFICATE APPLICATION OR ANY SUBSEQUENT SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF THE CERTIFICATE IS UNNECESSARY OR UNAUTHORIZED OR WAS IMPROPERLY, NEGLIGENTLY, OR UNLAWFULLY RENDERED, MAY BE DETERMINED BY SUBMISSION TO ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED BY CALIFORNIA LAW, AND NOT BY A LAWSUIT OR RESORT TO COURT PROCESS EXCEPT AS CALIFORNIA LAW PROVIDES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS OR EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY SECTION 17331.3 OF THE FINANCIAL CODE.   THE APPLICANT MAY, SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT, SUBMIT ANY ISSUE ARISING FROM A DECISION BY FIDELITY CORPORATION TO DENY THIS CERTIFICATE APPLICATION OR TO SUSPEND OR REVOKE THE CERTIFICATE TO BE DECIDED BY BINDING NEUTRAL ARBITRATION.   UPON AN AGREEMENT TO SUBMIT TO BINDING NEUTRAL ARBITRATION, THE APPLICANT HAS NO RIGHT TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE CONCERNING THIS CERTIFICATE APPLICATION LITIGATED IN A COURT OR JURY TRIAL NOR ANY JUDICIAL RIGHTS TO DISCOVERY AND APPEAL, EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED IN THE ESCROW LAW.   ARBITRATION MAY BE COMPELLED AS PROVIDED BY LAW.

(h) There is no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature may arise against Fidelity Corporation or its directors, officers, employees, or agents, for any decision to deny an application for a certificate or to suspend or revoke the certificate of any person or for the timing of any decision or the timing of any notice to persons or members thereof, or for any failure to deny an application under subdivision (a) of Section 17331.2. This subdivision does not apply to acts performed in bad faith or with malice.

(i) Fidelity Corporation, any member of Fidelity Corporation, an agent of Fidelity Corporation or of its members, or any person who uses any information obtained under this section for any purpose not authorized by this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor.

(j) Section 17331, 17331.1, or 17331.2 does not constitute a restriction or limitation upon the obligation of Fidelity Corporation to indemnify members against loss, as provided in Sections 17310 and 17314. The failure to obtain a certificate, the denial of an application for a certificate, or the suspension, cancellation, or revocation of a certificate does not limit the obligation of Fidelity Corporation to indemnify a member against loss.

(k) Notwithstanding Section 11105 of the Penal Code, Fidelity Corporation is entitled to receive state summary criminal history information and subsequent arrest notification from the Department of Justice as a result of fingerprint images and related information submitted to the Department of Justice by the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, pursuant to subdivision (g) of Section 17209, Section 17212.1, and subdivision (d) of Section 17414.1, by or on behalf of escrow agents, shareholders, officers, directors, trustees, managers, or employees of an escrow agent, directly or indirectly compensated by an escrow agent.

The Department of Justice shall review the information returned from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and compile and disseminate a response to the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation and a fitness determination to Fidelity Corporation pursuant to subdivision (p) of Section 11105 of the Penal Code.

(3) The Department of Justice shall charge a fee sufficient to cover the costs of processing the requests pursuant to this subdivision.



######### 17331.1.  
(a) Any person not previously issued a certificate must, upon employment with an escrow agent within this state, apply to Fidelity Corporation for a certificate. The member shall submit all applications for certificates to Fidelity Corporation within 10 business days of the date of employment. The person may continue employment until or unless denied a certificate by Fidelity Corporation. 

(b) Upon written notice by Fidelity Corporation to any or all members that any person has been denied a certificate, or has had a certificate suspended, canceled, or revoked, no member or person acting on behalf of a member shall authorize that person to have access to money or negotiable securities belonging to or in the possession of the escrow agent, or to draw checks upon the escrow agent or the trust accounts of the escrow agent. Any member or person who commits or who causes a violation of this section, which violation was either known or should have been known by the member or the person committing or causing the violation, may be subject to action by the commissioner and Fidelity Corporation as provided for in this division.

(c) Each member and each person required to have a certificate shall comply with the Fidelity Corporation rules, to be approved by the commissioner, concerning the manner and timing within which Fidelity Corporation shall receive notice of employment, change of the person’s name, mailing address, or employment status, the certificate form, and the procedures for the administration thereof.

(e) Any member that suffers a loss of trust obligations caused by any person who is required to have a certificate but has (1) failed to apply for a certificate, (2) has had the application for a certificate denied, (3) has a suspended certificate, or (4) whose certificate has been revoked shall be obligated to pay a deductible in the amount of 100 percent of the amount of the loss, notwithstanding the amount of the statutory deductible as prescribed by Section 17314.3. The failure to obtain a certificate, the denial of an application for a certificate, or the suspension, cancellation, or revocation of a certificate shall not limit the obligation of Fidelity Corporation to indemnify a member against loss of trust obligations as defined in this division.



######### 17331.2.  
(a) Fidelity Corporation shall deny the application for a certificate or revoke the certificate of any person, upon any of the following grounds:

(1) The application contains a material misrepresentation of fact or fails to disclose a material fact so as to render the application false or misleading, or if any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for a certificate, reasonably would have warranted Fidelity Corporation to refuse originally to issue that certificate.

(2) That the person has been convicted of a crime or offense, whether a felony, an offense punishable as a felony, or a misdemeanor, that involved dishonesty, fraud, deceit, embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, misappropriation of property, or any other crime reasonably related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of a person engaged in business in accordance with this division. A conviction within the meaning of this section is a plea or verdict of guilty or a conviction following a plea of nolo contendere. A conviction also includes an order granting probation and suspending the imposition of sentence, notwithstanding a subsequent order pursuant to Section 1203.4 or 1203.4a of the Penal Code permitting the person to withdraw his or her plea of guilty and to enter a plea of not guilty, or setting aside the verdict of guilty, or dismissing the accusation, information, or indictment. If, however, the conviction is more than 10 years old, or the conviction has been expunged, or the person has obtained a certificate of rehabilitation or relief under Section 1203.4 or 1203.4a of the Penal Code, or if the conviction was an infraction, then the person may have a Fidelity Corporation certificate upon showing by clear and convincing proof to a reasonable certainty that the conviction is no longer reasonably related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of a person engaged in business in accordance with this division or that person’s employment with a member.

(3) That the person has been held liable in a civil action by final judgment of any court if the judgment involved dishonesty, fraud, deceit, embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, or misappropriation of property or the person has been ordered to make restitution to a victim in any criminal case involving a crime or offense set forth in paragraph (2). The person may have a Fidelity Corporation certificate upon showing by clear and convincing proof to a reasonable certainty that the judgment or restitution order is no longer reasonably related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of a person engaged in business in accordance with this division or that person’s employment with a member.

(4) That the person has (A) committed or caused to be committed an act which caused any member to suffer a loss; (B) committed or caused to be committed or colluded with any other person committing any act which caused a loss, for which Fidelity Corporation or the insurer on any insurance policy or fidelity bond purchased by Fidelity Corporation, or both, to become liable to indemnify any member; or (C) committed or caused to be committed an act of dishonesty, fraud, deceit, embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, or misappropriation of property, to the material damage of a member or for which the member has been held liable to any third party, by final judgment.

(5) That the person has been barred from employment by final order of the commissioner pursuant to Section 17423.

(6) That the person has been deemed not qualified to serve in any capacity as a director or officer or in any other position involving management duties with a financial institution, pursuant to Division 1.8 (commencing with Section 4990).

(7) That the person has been denied coverage or reinstatement by any insurer under any fidelity bond or crime policy, unless a decision of reinstatement of coverage has been made after that denial. A person who obtained a decision of reinstatement of coverage prior to the effective date of this section may have a Fidelity Corporation certificate notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), unless any other ground for denial or revocation applies to that person.

(b) Fidelity Corporation shall suspend the certificate of any person upon either of the following grounds:

(1) That the person has been censured or suspended from any position of employment by final order of the commissioner. The certificate suspension shall be for a term concurrent with the final order of the commissioner.

(2) That the person has been barred from any position of employment or management or control of any escrow agent, for a term of less than permanent, by final order of the commissioner. The certificate suspension shall be for a term concurrent with the final order of the commissioner.

(c) Fidelity Corporation may suspend the certificate of any person under either of the following grounds:

(1) That there is an action commenced by the commissioner to either suspend or bar that person, under Section 17423.

(2) That any member with whom the person was employed has given a proof of loss or a notice of an occurrence which may give rise to a claim for a loss of trust obligations either of which identifies the person as the person responsible for the loss or as a person acting in collusion with the person causing the loss.

(d) Upon denial of an application for, or upon suspension or revocation of the certificate of any person, Fidelity Corporation shall provide written notice to the member with whom that person is employed of the decision, pending any appeal therefrom which might be made. Thereafter, the member shall not allow that person to have access to money or negotiable instruments or securities belonging to or in the possession of the escrow agent, or to draw checks upon the escrow agent or the trust accounts of the escrow agent, but that person may otherwise continue in the performance and discharge of other duties of an employee. Fidelity Corporation shall notify the person in writing of the decision to deny, suspend, or revoke the certificate and of the person’s right of appeal, together with the notice of appeal. The grounds and basis for the decision shall be stated in the notice thereof. All notices may be served either personally or by mail, properly addressed to the address of record for the member and the person.

(e) Any person whose application for a certificate has been denied, or whose certificate has been suspended or revoked, may appeal the decision, as provided in Section 17331.3. While that appeal is pending, the person may not have access to money or negotiable instruments or securities belonging to or in the possession of the escrow agent, or to draw checks upon the escrow agent or the trust accounts of the escrow agent, but that person may otherwise continue in the performance and discharge of other duties of an employee pending final decision of that person’s appeal. Failure to remove the person whose application has been denied, or whose certificate has been suspended or revoked, as a signer on the trust accounts may be subject to action by the commissioner as provided for in this division and shall be subject to penalties as set forth in Section 17331.1.

(f) Upon expiration of the time for an appeal, or upon conclusion of the appeal, the decision to deny an application for or to suspend or revoke the certificate of any person shall become final. Fidelity Corporation shall give written notice to the member and to the person of the final decision within 10 days. Thereafter, Fidelity Corporation shall disclose in writing to all members the identity of persons whose application has been denied or whose certificate has been revoked. The person whose certificate has been denied or revoked may file a certificate reapplication after the period of time specified in Section 11522 of the Government Code, dating from the Fidelity Corporation final decision, provided that the person has satisfied all obligations to Fidelity Corporation under any prior arbitration award or judgment.



######### 17331.3.  
(a) Notice to the person, and to the member with whom the person is employed, of the decision to deny an application for or to revoke or suspend a Fidelity Corporation Certificate, shall be effective immediately upon personal delivery, or by facsimile if written acknowledgment of receipt by the member and the person is returned by facsimile, or within five days of the date of mailing, and shall become final upon expiration of the time for filing a notice of appeal or upon the conclusion of the appeal, as provided for in this section. 

(b) The person whose application for a certificate has been denied, or whose certificate has been suspended or revoked may, within 15 days after notice of the decision, file with Fidelity Corporation a notice of appeal and request for a hearing, by binding arbitration or judicial action, as provided herein. Neither the notice of appeal nor the request for a hearing shall stay the decision of Fidelity Corporation under Section 17331.2. A late notice of appeal and request for a hearing may be accepted upon a showing of good cause. 

(c) The hearing for the appeal may be resolved by arbitration in accordance with Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 1280) of Title 9 of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The notice of the person’s right to appeal and notice of appeal provided by Fidelity Corporation shall contain a schedule of proposed arbitrators or of a proposed arbitration forum which provides a panel of arbitrators and method for appointing an arbitrator. The person filing the notice of arbitration may agree to submit the decision and matter to binding arbitration and accept an arbitrator whose name appears on the notice or may propose, in writing, an alternative arbitrator, but if Fidelity Corporation does not notify the person of acceptance of the proposed alternative arbitrator within 10 days, then either party may within 30 days petition the court to appoint an arbitrator, as provided by law. 

(d) If the person does not agree to submit the decision and matter to binding arbitration, then the person may, within 30 days after the notice of the decision, file an action in superior court concerning the decision to deny an application for, or to suspend or revoke the certificate. The court may, on its own motion, or shall, upon the filing of an election by any or either party, order that the action be submitted to arbitration pursuant to Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 1141.10) of Title 3 of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in which case the action shall be accorded that priority for hearing as circumstances permit, unless the plaintiff may otherwise request. 

(e) Either Fidelity Corporation or the person whose application for a certificate has been denied, or whose certificate has been suspended or revoked, may apply to the superior court for relief to compel compliance with this section in accordance with Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 1084) of Title 1 of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 

(f) Upon the conclusion of the hearing on appeal, either the arbitrator or the court may in its discretion award to the prevailing party as an item of costs, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and costs. All other expenses and fees for the arbitration incurred prior to the decision of the arbitrator or confirmation of the decision by the court shall be shared equally by the parties except for attorneys’ fees, witness fees or other expenses incurred by either party for his or her own benefit. 

(g) Upon the filing of any action in the superior court by the person whose application for a certificate has been denied, or whose certificate has been suspended or revoked, Fidelity Corporation at any time within 30 days after service of the summons may upon notice and hearing, move the court for an order requiring the plaintiff to furnish an undertaking to secure an award of costs and attorneys’ fees which may be awarded in the action. The motion shall be supported by affidavit showing that the action filed is frivolous and that there is no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the action will benefit the plaintiff and that the moving party fully complied with this section and Section 17331.2. 

At the hearing upon the motion, the court shall consider any written or oral evidence, by witnesses or affidavit, as may be material (1) to the ground or grounds upon which the motion is based, or (2) to a determination of the probable reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, of the defendant and the moving party, which will be incurred in the defense of the action. 

If the court determines, after hearing the evidence adduced by the parties, that the moving party has established a probability in support of any of the grounds upon which the motion is based, the court shall fix the amount of the undertaking, not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), to be furnished by the plaintiff for reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, which may be incurred by the moving party in connection with the action. 

A ruling by the court on the motion shall not be a determination of any issue in the action or of the merits thereof. If the court, upon the motion, makes a determination that a bond shall be furnished by the plaintiff, the action shall be dismissed as to the defendant, unless the bond required by the court has been furnished within a reasonable time as may be fixed by the court. Upon the filing of a motion pursuant to this subdivision, no other pleadings need be filed by the defendant and the prosecution of the action shall be stayed until 10 days after the motion has been disposed of. The motion shall be considered pursuant to this subdivision and in accordance with Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 995.010) of Title 14 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

Independent of any duty or obligation of Fidelity Corporation, the member shall do nothing to prejudice those rights. In any subrogation action filed by Fidelity Corporation, the provider of the fidelity bond or insurance policy if payment was made thereunder, or both, Fidelity Corporation shall have the first right to the proceeds of any judgment or settlement obtained against the principal obligors and any other party who is held liable jointly or severally, in whole or in part, with the principal obligors, up to the amount actually paid on the claim by Fidelity Corporation.

(2) The discovery by the independent accountant or third-party contractor of an unreconcilable trust account debit balance.

(3) The discovery by the independent accountant or third-party contractor that trust account reconciliations have not been performed for two months after the end of any calendar month.

(4) The discovery by the independent accountant or third-party contractor of exception items in trust account exception reports, that remain uncorrected for two months after the end of any calendar month.

Nothing in this subdivision imposes any duty or obligation on an independent accountant or third-party contractor to Fidelity Corporation, members of Fidelity Corporation, or the commissioner.

(m) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to require a licensee to contract with a third party to reconcile trust account records.



######### 17406.1.  
(a) Whenever the reports and financial statements required pursuant to subdivision (a), (b), or (c) of Section 17406 are to be reported upon or certified by an accountant other than the accountant reporting upon or certifying the licensee’s most recent reports or financial statements, the licensee shall furnish the commissioner with a written notice stating whether there was any disagreement with the former accountant on any matter in connection with the preparation of the most recent reports or financial statements reported upon or certified by that former accountant. If there was any disagreement, the licensee’s written notice shall describe the reasons for the disagreement. The written notice shall be signed by the chief executive officer of the licensee. The licensee shall also request, in writing, that the former accountant furnish the licensee with a letter addressed to the commissioner stating whether the former accountant agrees with the statements contained in the licensee’s written notice. If the former accountant disagrees with any of the licensee’s statements, the former accountant’s letter shall explain the reasons for disagreeing with the licensee’s statements. The written notice of the licensee, along with the former accountant’s letter shall be filed with the commissioner no later than 30 days from the date of engagement of the new accountant.

The amount of the penalty may not exceed one hundred dollars ($100) for each day for the first five days the report or information is overdue, and thereafter may not exceed five hundred dollars ($500) for each day the report or information is overdue.

(c) If, after an order has been made under subdivision (b), a request for hearing is filed in writing within 30 days of the date of service of the order by the person to whom the order was directed, a hearing shall be held in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, and the commissioner shall have all the powers granted under that chapter.

(d) If the person fails to file a written request for a hearing within 30 days of the date of service of the order, the order imposing the penalty shall be deemed a final order of the commissioner, and the penalty shall be paid within five business days.

(e) If a hearing is requested, the penalty shall be paid within five business days after the effective date of any decision in the case ordering payment to be made.



######### 17409.  
(a) All moneys deposited in escrow to be delivered upon the close of the escrow or upon any other contingency shall be deposited and maintained in a noninterest-bearing demand or checking account in a bank, a state or federal savings bank, or a state or federal savings association or in a noninterest-bearing account subject to immediate withdrawal in an industrial loan company insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and approved to receive those moneys by the commissioner. Thereafter, these moneys may be deposited in an interest-bearing account in a bank, a state or federal savings bank, a state or federal savings association, an industrial loan company approved to receive those moneys by the commissioner, or a state or federal credit union, if the depositor is qualified for membership under the bylaws of that credit union, and the moneys are maintained separate, distinct, and apart from funds belonging to the escrow agent. Those funds, when deposited, are to be designated as “trust funds,” “escrow accounts,” or under some other appropriate name indicating that the funds are not the funds of the escrow agent.

Upon request of the commissioner, a licensee shall furnish to the commissioner an authorization for examination of financial records of any trust funds or escrow accounts, maintained in a financial institution, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 7473 of the Government Code.

(b) A licensee engaged in the business of receiving escrows for deposit or delivery of the types specified in subdivision (c) of Section 17312 and of the types not specified therein shall maintain separate escrow trust accounts, for both types of escrow business in the same manner as provided in subdivision (a) of this section and Sections 17409.1, 17410, 17411, and 17411.1.

(c) Any agreement with a financial institution to establish a trust account pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by a letter from the licensee authorizing and requesting that the financial institution immediately notify the commissioner and Fidelity Corporation, in either electronic or paper form, when it becomes aware of either of the following:

(1) The closure of any account subject to this section, other than to transfer the funds to another designated trust account at the same financial institution in the name of the escrow agent or the remittance of the funds to the Controller’s office for escheat purposes.

(2) The occurrence of any overdraft balance in an account subject to this section.

This subdivision does not impose any duty or obligation on a financial institution to Fidelity Corporation, members of Fidelity Corporation, or the commissioner.



######### 17409.1.  
(a) Each person subject to this chapter shall maintain separate escrow trust accounts for each licensed location. Transfers between accounts are prohibited except by the actual writing of a check from one escrow to the other, and by depositing the check for the account of, and the writing of a receipt for the escrow to which the funds are being transferred. Each transfer shall be properly supported and documented in escrow files by inclusion of escrow instructions executed by the principals authorizing the transfer.

(b) With regard to Internet escrow companies, transfers to trust accounts by commercial banks and from operating accounts to cover losses may be made through wire transfer. Receipts for all these transactions may be maintained in electronic form.



######### 17410.  
(a) Escrow or trust funds are not subject to enforcement of a money judgment arising out of any claim against the licensee or person acting as escrow agent, and in no instance shall such escrow or trust funds be considered or treated as an asset of the licensee or person performing the functions of an escrow agent.

(b) Interest paid or payable on funds deposited in escrow by a licensee are not subject to enforcement of a money judgment arising out of any claim against the licensee or person acting as escrow agent.



######### 17411.  
No person shall knowingly keep or cause to be kept any funds or money in any bank or state or federal savings and loan association under the heading of “trust funds” or “escrow accounts” or any other name designating such funds or money as belonging to the clients of any escrow agency, except actual escrow or trust funds deposited with such agency.



######### 17411.1.  
“Trust funds” or “escrow accounts” as used in Sections 17409, 17410, and 17411 shall include all funds required to be held by an escrow agent pursuant to a federal or state law, or requirement of a governmental agency.



######### 17414.  
(a) It is a violation for any person subject to this division or any director, stockholder, trustee, officer, agent, or employee of any such person to do any of the following:

(1) Knowingly or recklessly disburse or cause the disbursal of escrow funds otherwise than in accordance with escrow instructions, or knowingly or recklessly to direct, participate in, or aid or abet in a material way, any activity which constitutes theft or fraud in connection with any escrow transaction.

(2) Knowingly or recklessly make or cause to be made any misstatement or omission to state a material fact, orally or in writing, in escrow books, accounts, files, reports, exhibits, statements, or any other document pertaining to an escrow or escrow affairs.

(b) Any director, officer, stockholder, trustee, employee, or agent of an escrow agent, who abstracts or willfully misappropriates money, funds, trust obligations or property deposited with an escrow agent, is guilty of a felony. Upon conviction, of an offense under this section or similar offenses specified in Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 470), Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 484), or Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 503) of Title 13 of Part 1 of the Penal Code, the court shall, in addition to any other punishment imposed, order the person to make full restitution, first to the escrow agent and then to Fidelity Corporation, to the extent it has indemnified the escrow agent. Nothing in this section shall be deemed or construed to repeal, amend, or impair any existing provision of law prescribing a punishment for such an offense.

(c) Any person subject to this division who knows of a person’s involvement in an abstraction or misappropriation of money, funds, trust obligations, or property deposited with a licensed escrow agent shall immediately report the abstraction or misappropriation in writing to the commissioner and to Fidelity Corporation. No person shall be civilly liable for reporting as required under this subdivision, unless the information provided in the report is false and the person providing false information does so with knowledge and malice. The reports filed under this section, including the identity of the person making the filing, shall remain confidential pursuant to state law.



######### 17414.1.  
(a) Any person who has been convicted of or pleaded nolo contendere to any crime specified in subdivision (b) within the past 10 years, or has been held liable in any civil action by final judgment or any administrative judgment by any public agency within the past 7 years, of any of the provisions specified in subdivision (b) shall not serve in any capacity as an officer, director, stockholder, trustee, agent, or employee of an escrow agent, or in any position involving any duties with an escrow agent, in this state. This subdivision shall not apply to any person whose office, employment, ownership interest, or other participation in the business of a licensed escrow agent commenced prior to January 1, 1992.

(b) (1) Subdivision (a) applies to criminal convictions of, pleas of nolo contendere to, or civil or administrative judgments entered for, any of the following offenses:

(c) On and after January 1, 1992, any person who seeks employment by, or an ownership interest in, or other participation in the business of a licensed escrow agent shall, as a condition to obtaining that employment, interest, or participation, authorize Fidelity Corporation and the commissioner, or both, to have access to that person’s state and federal summary criminal history information, as defined in Section 11105 of the Penal Code, for purposes of determining whether the person has a prior conviction of, or pleaded nolo contendere to, a criminal offense specified in subdivision (b).

(d) On or before the 10th day of employment, each escrow agent shall obtain and forward to the commissioner the fingerprint images and related information of persons seeking employment by an escrow agent. The fingerprint images and related information may be submitted by certified mail, return receipt requested, or transmitted electronically, using the process established by the Department of Justice for requesting state and federal summary criminal history information. Persons who have previously submitted fingerprints or fingerprint images and related information to the commissioner may so notify the commissioner and need not submit additional fingerprint images and related information unless requested to do so by the commissioner. The commissioner shall provide written notice to both the escrow agent and to the person if any of the information received pursuant to this division shows that the person’s employment would be in violation of Section 17414.1, and the escrow agent shall deny the person the employment. A person whose employment is in violation of subdivision (a) shall not have access to trust funds or sign checks or otherwise perform any activities related to the processing of escrow transactions after the licensed escrow agent has been notified by the commissioner that the person’s employment is in violation of subdivision (a).

(e) Any state and federal summary criminal history information obtained pursuant to this section shall be kept confidential and a recipient shall not disclose the contents other than for the purpose of determining eligibility for employment by, acquisition of an ownership interest in, or other participation in, the business of a licensed escrow agent.

(f) The authority granted by this section to the commissioner or to Fidelity Corporation shall be in addition to any other authority granted by law to obtain information about any person who is subject to this division. This section shall not be construed to limit any authority of the commissioner or Fidelity Corporation otherwise provided by law.

(g) Any person who knowingly violates subdivision (a) or (d), including, but not limited to, any escrow agent who permits employment by, an ownership interest in, or other participation in, the business of an escrow agent in violation of subdivision (a) or (d) shall, upon conviction, be subject to punishment pursuant to Section 17700. Any person who knows of a violation of subdivision (a) or (d) shall immediately report the violation in writing to the commissioner. A person shall not be civilly liable for reporting as required under this subdivision unless the information provided in the report is false, and the person providing false information does so with knowledge and malice. The reports filed under this section, including the identity of the person making the filing, shall remain confidential pursuant to state law.

(h) This section shall not be construed to permit the reinstatement of any person barred by the commissioner pursuant to Section 17423 nor to prohibit the commissioner from bringing any action pursuant to Section 17423.

(i) If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this section which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this section are severable.



######### 17414.2.  
(a) In response to any written request by an escrow agent or by Fidelity Corporation, any bank, savings association, credit union, any other financial institution, or any other exempt person specified in Section 17006, an escrow agent or Fidelity Corporation may provide a written employment reference that advises of the person’s involvement in a crime or act specified in Section 17414 or subdivision (b) of Section 17414.1, or any theft, embezzlement, misappropriation, or other defalcation which has been reported to federal authorities pursuant to federal banking guidelines, or that has been reported to the commissioner or Fidelity Corporation, pursuant to this division. In order for the immunity provided in subdivision (b) to apply, a copy of the written employment reference shall be sent concurrently by the Fidelity Corporation, person, entity, escrow agent, bank, savings association, credit union, any other financial institution, or exempt person specified in Section 17006 providing the reference, to the last known address of the person concerning whom the reference is provided. 

(b) No licensed escrow agent, bank, savings association, credit union, any other financial institution, exempt person specified in Section 17006, or Fidelity Corporation shall be civilly liable for providing an employment reference as specified in subdivision (a), unless the information provided is false and the licensed escrow agent, bank, savings association, credit union, any other financial institution, or exempt person specified in Section 17006, or Fidelity Corporation providing false information does so with knowledge and malice.



######### 17415.  
(a) If the commissioner, as a result of any examination or from any report made to the commissioner, shall find that any person subject to this division is in an insolvent condition, is conducting or has conducted escrow business in such an unsafe or injurious manner as to render further operations hazardous to the public or to customers, is failing or has failed to comply with the provisions of Section 17212.1 or 17414.1, is permitting or has permitted its tangible net worth to be lower than the minimum required by law, is failing or has failed to maintain its liquid assets in excess of current liabilities as set forth in Section 17210, or is failing or has failed to comply with the bonding requirements of Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 17200) of this division, the commissioner may, by an order addressed to and served by registered or certified mail or by personal service on such person and on any other person having in their possession or control any escrowed funds, trust funds, or other property deposited in escrow with said person, direct discontinuance of the disbursement of trust funds by the parties or any of them, the receipt of trust funds, the delivery or recording of documents received in escrow, or other business operations. No person having in their possession any of these funds or documents shall be liable for failure to comply with the order unless they received written notice of the order. Subject to subdivision (b), the order shall remain in effect until set aside by the commissioner in whole or in part, the person is the subject of an order for relief in bankruptcy, or pursuant to Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 17621) of this division the commissioner has assumed possession of the escrow agent.

(b) Within 15 days from the date of an order pursuant to subdivision (a), the person may request a hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act, Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code. Upon receipt of a request, the matter shall be set for hearing to commence within 30 days after such receipt unless the person subject to this division consents to a later date. If no hearing is requested within 15 days after the mailing or service of such notice and none is ordered by the commissioner, the failure to request a hearing shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing. Neither the request for a hearing nor the hearing itself shall stay the order issued by the commissioner under subdivision (a).



######### 17416.  
Whenever in the opinion of the commissioner any person, except as named in Section 17006, is engaged, either actually or through subterfuge, in the business of receiving escrows for deposit or delivery as defined in this division, without a license from the commissioner the commissioner may order that person to desist and to refrain from engaging in that business. If, within 30 days after such an order is served, a request for a hearing is filed in writing and the hearing is not held within 60 days thereafter, the order is rescinded.



######### 17419.  
On and after January 1, 1992, any person seeking employment with an escrow agent shall complete an employment application on or before the first day of employment which includes, at least, the following information. A copy of the employment application shall be forwarded to the commissioner on or before the first day of the applicant’s employment. Persons required to file a statement of identity and questionnaire pursuant to subdivision (g) of Section 17209 or Section 17212.1 are not required to file the employment application set forth in this section. Each person completing the employment application shall be given the notice required by the Information Practices Act (Section 1798.17 of the Civil Code), copies of which may be obtained from the commissioner. Nothing in this section shall limit an escrow agent from requesting additional information from an applicant.

Except for the normal compensation of his own employees, it shall be a violation of this division for any person subject to this division to pay over to any other person any commission, fee, or other consideration as compensation for referring, soliciting, handling, or servicing escrow customers or accounts.

It shall also be a violation for any person to enter into any arrangement, either of his own making or of a subsidiary nature, or through any other person having a dual capacity, or through any person having a direct or indirect interest in the escrow, or other device permitting any fee, commission, or compensation which is contingent upon the performance of any act, condition, or instruction set forth in an escrow to be drawn or paid, either in whole or in part, or in kind or its equivalent, prior to the actual closing and completion of the escrow.



######### 17421.  
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 17420, a disbursal, other than for a fee, commission or compensation may be advanced or paid out prior to the close of an escrow if the written instructions of all parties to the transaction so provide.



######### 17421.5.  
(a) Notwithstanding Section 17420, a licensee may charge a fee for administering an escrow that has been postponed for at least two months from the most recent closing date agreed upon by the parties in the written instructions or has been canceled if all of the following requirements are met:

(1) The postponement or cancellation resulted from the acts or omissions of the parties to the escrow transaction.

(2) The fee was disclosed in the written instructions in not less than 8-point bold type on the face or front page of the instructions.

(3) The principal parties to the escrow transaction have executed the written fee instructions by initialing those instructions.

(b) This section shall apply to written instructions made on and after January 1, 2008.

A joint control agent, unless acting pursuant to written instructions of his principals, shall not disburse funds for the payment of the cost of labor, materials, services, permits, fees, or other items of expense incurred in the construction of improvements upon real property until such time as he determines that the person furnishing such labor, materials, services, permits, fees, or other items has substantially complied with the specifications contained in the control agreement.



######### 17423.  
(a) The commissioner may, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, by order, censure or suspend for a period not exceeding 12 months, or bar from any position of employment, management, or control any escrow agent, or any other person, if the commissioner finds either of the following:

(1) That the censure, suspension, or bar is in the public interest and that the person has committed or caused a violation of this division or rule or order of the commissioner, which violation was either known or should have been known by the person committing or causing it or has caused material damage to the escrow agent or to the public. 

(2) That the person has been convicted of or pleaded nolo contendere to any crime, or has been held liable in any civil action by final judgment, or any administrative judgment by any public agency, if that crime or civil or administrative judgment involved any offense specified in subdivision (b) of Section 17414.1, or any other offense reasonably related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of a person engaged in the business in accordance with the provisions of this division.

(b) Within 15 days from the date of a notice of intention to issue an order pursuant to subdivision (a), the person may request a hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code). Upon receipt of a request, the matter shall be set for hearing to commence within 30 days after such receipt unless the person subject to this division consents to a later date. If no hearing is requested within 15 days after the mailing or service of such notice and none is ordered by the commissioner, the failure to request a hearing shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing. 

(c) Upon receipt of a notice of intention to issue an order pursuant to this section, the person who is the subject of the proposed order is immediately prohibited from engaging in any escrow processing activities, including disbursing any trust funds in the escrow agent’s possession, custody or control, and the financial institution holding trust funds shall be so notified by service of the notice, accusation and other administrative pleadings. The prohibition against disbursement of trust funds may be set aside, in whole or in part, by the commissioner for good cause. 

(d) Fidelity Corporation shall disclose to all licensees the identity of persons who have been censured, suspended, or barred from any position of employment, management, or control. 

(e) Persons suspended or barred under this section are prohibited from participating in any business activity of a licensed escrow agent and from engaging in any business activity on the premises where a licensed escrow agent is conducting escrow business. This subdivision shall not be construed to prohibit suspended or barred persons from having their personal escrow transactions processed by a licensed escrow agent. 

(f) This section shall apply to any violation, conviction, plea, or judgment occurring at any time prior to and after the enactment of this section.

(g) The provisions of Section 17414.1 exempting convictions for which a person has obtained a certificate of rehabilitation from the prohibition against serving as an officer, director, stockholder, trustee, agent, or employee of an escrow agent, or in any position involving any duties with an escrow agent, shall not apply to permit the reinstatement of any person barred by the commissioner pursuant to this section, nor to prohibit the commissioner from bringing any action pursuant to this section.

(h) If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this section which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this section are severable.



######### 17423.1.  
(a) (1) Whenever the commissioner takes any enforcement or disciplinary action pursuant to Section 17423, upon the action becoming final the commissioner shall notify the Real Estate Commissioner and the Insurance Commissioner of the action or actions taken. The purpose of this notification is to alert the departments that enforcement or disciplinary action has been taken, if the person seeks or obtains employment with entities regulated by the departments.

(2) The commissioner shall provide the Real Estate Commissioner and the Insurance Commissioner, in addition to the notification of the action taken, with a copy of the written accusation, statement of issues, or order issued or filed in the matter and, at the request of the Real Estate Commissioner or Insurance Commissioner, with any underlying factual material relevant to the enforcement or disciplinary action. Any confidential information provided by the commissioner to the Insurance Commissioner or the Real Estate Commissioner shall not be made public pursuant to this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the disclosure of any underlying factual material to the Insurance Commissioner or the Real Estate Commissioner shall not operate as a waiver of confidentiality or any privilege that the commissioner may assert.

(b) The commissioner shall establish and maintain, on the internet website maintained by the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, a separate and readily identifiable database of all persons who have been subject to any enforcement or disciplinary action that triggers the notification requirements of this section. The database shall also contain a direct link to the databases, described in Section 10176.1 of the Business and Professions Code and Section 12414.31 of the Insurance Code and required to be maintained on the Web sites of the Bureau of Real Estate and the Department of Insurance, respectively, of persons who have been subject to enforcement or disciplinary action for malfeasance or misconduct related to the escrow industry by the Insurance Commissioner and the Real Estate Commissioner.

(c) There shall be no liability on the part of, and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against, the State of California, the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, the Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation, any other state agency, or any officer, agent, employee, consultant, or contractor of the state, for the release of any false or unauthorized information pursuant to this section, unless the release of that information was done with knowledge and malice, or for the failure to release any information pursuant to this section.



######### 17424.  
(a) For any licensee, a disciplinary action taken by the State of California, another state, an agency of the federal government, or another country for an action substantially related to the activity regulated under this division may be grounds for disciplinary action by the commissioner. A certified copy of the record of the disciplinary action taken against the licensee by the State of California, other state, agency of the federal government, or other country shall be conclusive evidence of the events related therein.

(b) Nothing in this section shall preclude the commissioner from applying a specific statutory provision in this division providing for discipline against a licensee as a result of disciplinary action taken against a licensee by the State of California, another state, an agency of the federal government, or another country.



######### 17425.  
Any person subject to this division or any director, stockholder, trustee, officer, agent, or employee of that person who violates any provision of the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. Sec. 2601 et seq.), or any regulation promulgated thereunder, violates this division.







##### CHAPTER 4. Revocation of License [17600 - 17609.2]  

######### 17600.  
(a) An escrow agent’s license remains in effect until surrendered, revoked, or suspended.

(b) A licensee that ceases to engage in the business regulated by this division and desires to no longer be licensed shall notify the commissioner in writing and, at that time, tender the license and all other indicia of licensure to the commissioner. Within 105 days of the written notice to the commissioner, the licensee shall submit to the commissioner, at its own expense, a closing audit report as of the date the license is tendered to the commissioner for surrender, or for another period as the commissioner may specify, to be performed by an independent certified public accountant. The closing audit shall include, but not be limited to, information required by the commissioner, a bank reconciliation of the trust account, and a verified statement from a certified public accountant confirming lawful disbursement of funds. A license is not surrendered until the commissioner has reviewed and accepted the closing audit report, a determination has been made by the commissioner that acceptance of the surrender is in the public interest, and tender of the license is accepted in writing by the commissioner.



######### 17601.  
If the commissioner has reason to believe that any escrow agent is violating the provisions of this division, the commissioner may investigate the escrow agent’s business and examine the books, accounts, records, and files used in the business of every escrow agent and of every person who acts or claims to act as principal or agent under or without the authority of this division. For the purposes of examination the commissioner and representatives of the commissioner shall have free access to the offices and places of business, books, accounts, records, papers, files, safes, and vaults of all persons examined. The cost of any investigation, inspection, and examination of a licensee under this section shall be paid to the commissioner as provided in Section 17405.1.



######### 17602.  
If it appears to the commissioner that any licensed escrow agent is violating or has violated its articles of incorporation, or any law or rule binding upon it, the commissioner shall, by written order addressed to the agent direct the discontinuance of such violation. The order shall be effective immediately, but shall not become final except in accordance with the provisions of Section 17604.



######### 17602.5.  
If any licensed escrow agent fails to make any reports required by law or by the commissioner within ten (10) days from the day designated for the making of the reports, or within any extension of time granted by the commissioner, or fails to include therein any matter required by law or by the commissioner, such failure shall constitute grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license held by such escrow agent.



######### 17603.  
If it appears to the commissioner that any licensed escrow agent is conducting or has conducted business in an unsafe or injurious manner, the commissioner shall, by written order addressed to the agent direct the discontinuance of such unsafe or injurious practices. The order shall be effective immediately, but shall not become final except in accordance with the provisions of Section 17604.



######### 17604.  
No order issued pursuant to Sections 17602 or 17603 may become final except after notice to any licensed escrow agent affected thereby of the intention of the commissioner to make such order final and of the reasons therefor and that upon receipt of a request the matter will be set down for hearing to commence within 15 business days after such receipt unless the licensed agent affected consents to a later date. If no hearing is requested within 30 days after the mailing of such notice and none is ordered by the commissioner, the order may become final without hearing and the licensed escrow agent shall immediately discontinue the practices named in the order. If a hearing is requested or ordered, it shall be held in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, and the commissioner shall have all of the powers granted thereunder. If upon the hearing, it appears to the commissioner that the licensed agent is conducting or has conducted business in an unsafe and injurious manner or is violating or has violated its articles of incorporation or any law of this state, or any rule binding upon it, the commissioner shall make the order of discontinuance final and the licensed escrow agent shall immediately discontinue the practices named in the order.



######### 17605.  
The licensed escrow agent has ten (10) days after an order is made final in which to commence action to restrain enforcement of such order, and unless such action is commenced, and the enforcement of such order is enjoined within ten (10) days by the court in which the suit is brought, the licensed escrow agent shall comply with the order.



######### 17606.  
The commissioner may immediately revoke by order the escrow agent’s license if the licensee fails to comply with any order, unless the escrow agent secures a court order restraining the enforcement of the commissioner’s revocation order.



######### 17606.1.  
The license of an escrow agent shall be deemed revoked upon the completion or closure of a court approved liquidation of the business of the escrow agent, whether pursuant to Section 17635 or 17636, or otherwise, unless the escrow agent within 10 days of the court’s order approving the closing or completion of liquidation secures a court order restraining the revocation from taking effect.



######### 17607.  
(a) Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any person has engaged or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of this division or any rule or order hereunder, the commissioner may in the commissioner’s discretion bring an action in the name of the people of the State of California in the superior court to enjoin the acts or practices or to enforce compliance with this law or any rule or order hereunder. Upon a proper showing a permanent or preliminary injunction, restraining order, or writ of mandate shall be granted and a receiver, monitor, conservator, or other designated fiduciary or officer of the court, which may include the commissioner, may be appointed for the defendant or the defendant’s assets, or any other ancillary relief may be granted as appropriate.

A receiver, monitor, conservator, or other designated fiduciary or officer of the court appointed by the superior court pursuant to this section may, with the approval of the court, exercise any or all of the powers of the defendant’s officers, directors, partners, trustees, or persons who exercise similar powers and perform similar duties, including the filing of a petition for bankruptcy. No action at law or in equity may be maintained by any party against the commissioner, or a receiver, monitor, conservator, or other designated fiduciary or officer of the court, by reason of their exercising these powers or performing these duties pursuant to the order of, or with the approval of, the superior court.

(b) If the commissioner determines it is in the public interest, the commissioner may include in any action authorized by subdivision (a) a claim for ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, a claim for restitution or disgorgement or damages on behalf of the persons injured by the act or practice constituting the subject matter of the action, and the court shall have jurisdiction to award additional relief.



######### 17608.  
The commissioner may, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard, suspend or revoke any license if he finds that:

(a) The licensee has failed to maintain in effect a bond required under the provisions of this division.

(b) The licensee has violated any provision of this division or any rule made by the commissioner under and within the authority of this division.

(c) Any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for such license, reasonably would have warranted the commissioner in refusing originally to issue such license.



######### 17609.  
The revocation, suspension, surrender or expiration of an escrow agent’s license does not impair or affect pre-existing escrows lawfully contracted, but nothing contained in this division shall be deemed to authorize the acceptance of further funds or documents into escrow subsequent to such revocation, surrender or expiration or during any period of suspension.



######### 17609.1.  
The power of investigation and examination by the commissioner is not terminated by the surrender, suspension, or revocation of any license issued by him.



######### 17609.2.  
Whenever the commissioner deems it necessary for the general welfare of the public, the commissioner has continuous authority to exercise the powers set forth in this division whether or not an application for a license has been filed with the commissioner, any license has been issued, or if issued, has been surrendered, suspended, or revoked.







##### CHAPTER 5. Hearings [17610 - 17614]  

######### 17610.  
The commissioner, and all persons designated by him, may administer oaths, take the testimony of witnesses, and issue subpenas requiring the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, documents, and other things under their control, at any examination, investigation, or hearing in any part of the State.



######### 17611.  
(a) The commissioner may make such investigations as he or she deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate any provision of this division or any rule or order hereunder or to aid in the enforcement of this division. The commissioner may publish information concerning any violation of this division or any rule or order hereunder.

(b) In making any investigation authorized by subdivision (a), the commissioner may, for a reasonable time not exceeding 30 days, take possession of the books, records, accounts, and other papers pertaining to the business of any escrow agent or joint control agent and place a keeper in exclusive charge of them in the place where they are usually kept. During such possession no person shall remove or attempt to remove any of the books, records, accounts, or other papers except pursuant to a court order or with the consent of the commissioner. However, the directors, officers, partners, and employees of the escrow agent or joint control agent may examine the books, records, accounts, or other papers and the employees shall be permitted to make entries therein reflecting current transactions.

(c) For the purpose of any investigation or proceeding under this division, the commissioner or any officer designated by the commissioner may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, agreements, or other documents or records which the commissioner deems relevant or material to the inquiry.

(d) In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to, any person, the superior court, upon application of the commissioner, may issue to the person an order requiring him or her to appear before the commissioner, or the officer designated by the commissioner, there to produce documentary evidence, if so ordered, or to give evidence touching the matter under investigation or in question. Failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt.

(e) No person is excused from attending and testifying or from producing any document or record before the commissioner, or in obedience to the subpoena of the commissioner, or any officer designated by the commissioner, or in any proceeding instituted by the commissioner, on the ground that the testimony or evidence (documentary or otherwise) required by the commissioner may tend to incriminate the person or subject him or her to a penalty or forfeiture. However, no individual may be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he or she is compelled, after validly claiming his or her privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence (documentary or otherwise), except that the individual testimony is not exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury or contempt committed in testifying.



######### 17612.  
The authority to make or conduct any examination, investigation, or hearing, including the authority to administer oaths and to subpena witnesses, and to take their testimony may be delegated by the commissioner to any deputy, investigator, or auditor appointed by him for that purpose. The appointment shall be made by an instrument in writing, signed by the commissioner. Upon any examination, investigation, or hearing the instrument shall be produced by the deputy, investigator, or auditor at any time upon demand.



######### 17613.  
All hearings provided for in this division shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 5, Part 1, Division 3, Title 2, of the Government Code, and the commissioner has all the powers granted therein, except that a hearing held in accordance with Section 17604 may be presided over by a hearing officer qualified under Section 11502 of the Government Code, or by any deputy designated by the commissioner.



######### 17614.  
Every order, decision, license or other official act of the commissioner is subject to review, in accordance with law.






#### CHAPTER 6. Liquidation and Conservatorship [17621 - 17654]  


##### ARTICLE 1. Possession by Commissioner [17621 - 17629]  

######### 17621.  
Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any escrow agent subject to this division:

(a) Is in an insolvent condition;

(b) Is conducting escrow business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner;

(c) Has violated its charter or any law of the State of California;

(d) Refuses to submit its books, papers and affairs to the inspection of any examiner;

(e) Neglects or refuses to observe any order of the commissioner made pursuant to the provisions of this division, within the time specified therein, unless the enforcement of such order is restrained in a proceeding brought by the escrow agent;

(f) Any officer, director, or trustee of such escrow agent refuses to be examined upon oath touching the business of such escrow agent;

(g) Any officer, director, stockholder, or trustee of such escrow agent, or attorney in fact of such escrow agent has embezzled, sequestered, or willfully diverted the assets or trust funds of such escrow agent;

(h) Has permitted its tangible net worth to be lower than the minimum required by law;

(i) Has failed to comply with the bonding requirements of Chapter 2 of this division

the commissioner shall dispatch a written notice and summary of findings, as referred to in Section 17415, to the principal officer of the escrow agent involved or to its manager of record; and such escrow agent shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to comply or otherwise effect such remedies as the commissioner may deem acceptable. However, should the escrow agent so notified fail to comply within five days of receipt of the notice, or as soon as it appears to the commissioner that no compliance is possible, or in the event prompt delivery of the prescribed written notice is impossible, the commissioner may forthwith take possession of the property and business of such escrow agent and retain possession until such escrow agent resumes business or its affairs be finally liquidated as provided in this chapter. The escrow agent, with the consent of the commissioner, may resume business upon such conditions as the commissioner may prescribe.



######### 17622.  
Whenever the commissioner has taken possession of any licensee, such licensee, within 10 days after such taking, if it deems it is aggrieved thereby, may apply to the superior court in the county in which the head office of the licensee is located to enjoin further proceedings. The court, after citing the commissioner to show cause why further proceedings should not be enjoined and after a hearing and a determination of the facts upon the merits may dismiss such application or enjoin the commissioner from further proceeding and direct him to surrender the property and business to the licensee, or make such further order as may be just.



######### 17623.  
An appeal from a judgment enjoining the commissioner from further proceedings and directing the commissioner to surrender the business, property, and assets to the licensee does not operate as a stay of the judgment, unless the trial court in its discretion so orders. If the judgment dismisses the action an appeal therefrom does not operate as a stay of the judgment but the court rendering the judgment may, in its discretion enjoin the commissioner pending the appeal, from further proceedings and direct the commissioner, pending the appeal, to surrender the business, property, and assets to the licensee, if an undertaking is given as required by Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 916) of Title 13 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.



######### 17625.  
If the commissioner’s demand for the possession of the property, business and assets is not complied with within 24 hours after service of the demand, the commissioner may call to his assistance the sheriff of the county in which the principal place of business of such licensee is located, by giving the sheriff written demand the sheriff shall enforce the demands of the commissioner.



######### 17626.  
When the commissioner takes possession of the property, business and assets of any licensee, such licensee or the president and secretary of such licensee shall make and deliver to the commissioner verified schedules of its property, assets, and funds held in escrow. The commissioner may at any time examine under oath any licensee, or any officer, director, trustee, agent, or employee of such licensee, to determine whether or not all such property, assets, and funds held in escrow have been transferred and delivered to his possession.



######### 17627.  
The commissioner may issue subpoenas and require the attendance of parties for examination under this article as provided for in this chapter.



######### 17628.  
When the commissioner takes possession of the business, property, and assets of a licensee, he may appoint a custodian. The commissioner may require a good and sufficient bond from the custodian and place him in charge as his representative.



######### 17629.  
When the commissioner takes possession of the property, business, and assets of a licensee, he may collect all money due to such licensee and give receipt therefor. The commissioner may do such other acts as are necessary or expedient to collect, conserve, or protect the licensee’s business, property, and assets.








##### ARTICLE 2. Conservatorship [17630 - 17634]  

######### 17630.  
If any facts occur which would entitle the commissioner under Section 17621 to take possession of the property, business and assets of a licensee the commissioner may appoint a conservator of a licensee and require of him such bond as the commissioner deems proper. The commissioner may also, upon the request of the board of directors of a licensee, appoint a conservator of such licensee and require of him such bond as the commissioner deems proper. The conservator, under the direction of the commissioner, shall take possession of the property, business and assets of the licensee and take such action as he may deem necessary to conserve the assets of such licensee pending further disposition of its business. The conservator shall retain such possession until the property, business and assets of the licensee are returned to the licensee or until further order of the commissioner.



######### 17631.  
Subject to the other provisions of this article, a conservator, while in possession of the property, business and assets of a licensee, has the same powers and rights and is subject to the same duties and obligations as the commissioner while in possession of the property, business and assets of a licensee; and during such time the rights of a licensee and of all persons with respect thereto, subject to the other provisions of this article, are the same as if the commissioner had taken possession of such property, business and assets. A conservator, while in possession of the property, business and assets of a licensee, shall have all the rights, powers and privileges of the licensee, its officers and directors. All expenses of any such conservatorship shall be paid out of the assets of the licensee and shall be a lien thereon which shall be prior to any other lien. The conservator shall receive a salary, fixed by the commissioners, in an amount no greater than that which would be paid by the commissioner to a special deputy in charge of the liquidation of the licensee.



######### 17632.  
Upon appointing a conservator the commissioner shall cause to be made and completed at the earliest possible date such an examination of the affairs of the licensee as shall be necessary to inform him as to its financial condition.



######### 17633.  
A conservator, while in possession of the property, business and assets of a licensee, may call, upon the notice required by the licensee’s bylaws, a meeting of the investors of the licensee who are entitled to vote, for any purpose, including without limitation the election of a board of directors, and upon the holding of a meeting for such purpose the terms of office of all directors shall expire, or may call, upon the notice required by the licensee’s bylaws, a meeting of the board of directors for any purpose, including without limitation the filling of vacancies on the board of directors or the removal and election or the removal or election of officers. Each such meeting shall be supervised by the conservator.



######### 17634.  
If the commissioner becomes satisfied that it may be done safely and in the public interest, he may terminate the conservatorship and permit the licensee for which a conservator was appointed to resume its business under direction of its board of directors, subject to such terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations as he may prescribe.








##### ARTICLE 3. Liquidation by the Commissioner [17635 - 17654]  

######### 17635.  
If at any time after taking possession of the property and business of a licensee it shall appear to the commissioner that it would be futile to proceed as conservator with the conduct of the business of such person he may apply to the superior court of the county in which is located the principal office of such person in this State for an order to liquidate and wind up the business of said person. Upon a full hearing of such application, the court may make an order directing the winding up and liquidation of the business of such person by the commissioner, as liquidator.



######### 17636.  
Whenever the commissioner has taken possession of the property and business of a licensee he may petition the superior court for the appointment of a receiver to liquidate the affairs of the licensee.



######### 17637.  
The commissioner may appoint one or more special deputies to assist in the duties of liquidation and distribution under his direction and may also employ such special legal counsel, accountants, and assistants as may be needed and required and fix their salaries and compensation. All such salaries and compensation with other reasonable and necessary expenses as may be incurred in the liquidation shall be paid by the commissioner from the funds of the licensee in his hands. Such expenses shall include, among other things, that part of the salary of the commissioner and of his deputies, auditors, accountants, appraisers and other assistants, and that part of the general expenses of the commissioner’s office, as fairly represent, in the opinion of the commissioner, the proportion properly attributable to such liquidation.



######### 17638.  
In liquidating the affairs of a licensee the commissioner may:

(a) Collect all money due to, and claims of, the licensee and give receipt therefor.

(b) Approve and pay all just and equitable claims.

(c) Commence and prosecute all actions and proceedings necessary to enforce liquidation.

(d) Compound bad or doubtful debts or claims, borrow money, sell, convey, or transfer real or personal property, on order of the superior court of the county in this State in which the principal office of the licensee is located. The order shall be made after hearing and on such notice as the court prescribes.



######### 17639.  
After the issuance of an order of liquidation under Section 17635, any of the following transactions occurring within four months prior to the application for such order shall be voidable by the commissioner if such transaction has the effect of giving to or enabling any creditor of the licensee to obtain a preference over any other creditor, or to obtain a greater percentage of his debt than any other creditor:

(a) A transfer of property of the licensee.

(b) The creation of a lien upon the property of the licensee.

(c) The suffering of a judgment against such person.



######### 17640.  
If the commissioner is in possession of the business, property, and assets of a licensee, whether or not he is liquidating the affairs of such licensee, the commissioner may:

(a) Apply to the superior court of the county in this State in which the principal office of the licensee is located for an order confirming any action taken by the commissioner, or authorizing the commissioner to do any act or execute any instrument not expressly authorized by this part. The order shall be given after a hearing on such notice as the court prescribes.

(b) Pay and discharge any secured claims against the licensee, whether or not such claims have been presented for payment. No secured claim shall be paid in an amount larger than the value of the security at the time of payment.



######### 17641.  
Claims for damages resulting from the disaffirmance of an executory contract or lease by the commissioner may be filed and allowed. No claim of a landlord for damages resulting from the disaffirmance of an unexpired lease of real property or under any covenant of such lease shall be allowed in an amount exceeding the rent reserved by the lease, without acceleration, for the year succeeding the date of the surrender of the premises plus the amount of any unpaid accrued rent without acceleration. Any such claim must be filed within 30 days of the date of such disaffirmance.



######### 17642.  
When the commissioner determines to liquidate a licensee, he shall cause an inventory of all the assets of the licensee to be made in duplicate, file the original with the court, and file the duplicate in his office.



######### 17643.  
When the commissioner determines to liquidate a licensee he shall cause notice to be given by publication once a week for four successive weeks in some newspaper of general circulation published at or near the principal place of business in this State of such licensee, to all persons having claims against the licensee as creditors, investors, or otherwise, requiring them to present and file their claims and make legal proof thereof at a place and within a time designated in such publication. The time shall be not less than six months after the first publication. Within 10 days after the first publication the commissioner shall cause a copy of such notice to be mailed to all persons whose names appear of record upon the licensee’s books as creditors, or as parties to an uncompleted escrow transaction.



######### 17644.  
All claims, demands, or causes of action of creditors, and persons other than the parties to an escrow transaction against the licensee or against any property owned or held by it in trust or otherwise, must be presented to the commissioner in writing, verified by the claimant, or someone in his behalf, within the period specified in the notice for the presentation of claims, whether or not an action is pending to enforce any such claim or demand. The commissioner shall not approve any claim not so presented, and any such claim, demand or cause of action not so presented is forever barred.



######### 17645.  
Upon the expiration of the time fixed for the presentation of claims, the commissioner shall prepare in duplicate a full and complete schedule of all claims presented, specifying by classes those that have been approved and those that have been disapproved and shall file the original with the court and the duplicate in his office.



######### 17646.  
Not later than five days after the time of filing the schedule of claims with the court, written notice shall be mailed to all claimants whose claims have been rejected. Action to enforce the payment of or to establish any rejected claim must be brought and service had within four months from and after the date of filing of the schedule of claims with the proper court or all such actions are forever barred.



######### 17647.  
Regardless of any law of this state, the judges of the superior court of the county in this state in which the principal office of the licensee is located may, whenever the judges deem it necessary or advisable, hold hearings relating to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of any real property or any personal property of the licensee regardless of the location of the property. The hearings shall be held at the county seat of any county in this state or at the places in the home county of the superior court at which sessions are held.



######### 17648.  
If it appears improbable that anything can be realized from any property of the licensee and that the cost of maintaining, preserving, or protecting the property would probably be lost, the court may direct the commissioner to abandon the property.

The amount charged to the borrower for credit life or disability insurance shall not exceed, in the case of credit life insurance, fifty cents ($0.50) per year per one hundred dollars ($100) of indebtedness (and in the same proportion for longer or shorter maturities and larger or smaller amounts) or the amount established by or pursuant to Section 779.35 of the Insurance Code, whichever is less, or, in the case of credit disability insurance, the amount established by or pursuant to Section 779.35 of the Insurance Code.



######### 18291.  
(a) If credit life or disability insurance is provided pursuant to this division, and if the insured borrower dies or becomes disabled during the term of the loan contract, the insurance shall be sufficient to pay the total amount due on the loan (excluding unearned charges) outstanding on the date of death, or all amounts which become due on the loan thereafter during the period of disability, as the case may be, without any exception, reservation, or limitation, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 18292.

(b) If insurance with retroactive coverage is provided, the coverage shall provide for a prorated payment based upon the fraction of the month during which the insured is disabled, provided that the insured is continuously disabled during the waiting period set forth in the policy. If insurance without retroactive coverage is provided, the coverage shall provide for a prorated payment based upon the fraction of the month during which the insured is disabled, after first excluding the elimination period set forth in the policy. For the purpose of this subdivision, a month is any period of 30 consecutive days.

(c) The borrower shall sign a certificate of voluntary acceptance of any credit loss-of-income insurance purchased. The certificate shall state in boldface type which is larger than the type used in the loan contract that purchase of the insurance is not a necessary condition to receiving the loan and that the insurance may be canceled by the borrower at any time within 15 days after it goes into force, in which event a full refund shall be made of the premium paid.

(d) The minimum benefit shall be payment up to the agreed amount on not less than four benefit payments, as stated in the policy, which accrue during a covered period of unemployment, except that during the first 60 days after inception of the policy, the minimum benefit may be payment up to the agreed amount of one-half the number of benefit payments, as stated in the policy, which accrue during a covered period of unemployment. The maximum benefits shall be established in the contract of insurance.

(e) If combination credit disability and loss-of-income coverage is offered, credit disability and credit loss-of-income coverages shall also be offered separately.

(f) Benefits may not be denied because the insured cannot establish a valid claim for unemployment compensation benefits under Part 1 (commencing with Section 100) of Division 1 of the Unemployment Insurance Code solely because the former employer was not required to contribute to the State Unemployment Fund.

(g) If insurance with retroactive coverage is provided, the coverage shall provide for a prorated payment based upon the fraction of the month during which the insured is unemployed, provided that the insured is continuously unemployed during the waiting period set forth in the policy. If insurance without retroactive coverage is provided, the coverage shall provide for a prorated payment based upon the fraction of the month during which the insured is unemployed, after first excluding the elimination period set forth in the policy. For the purpose of this subdivision, a month is any period of 30 consecutive days.

(h) When unemployment continues for a number of months equal to or greater than the maximum number of benefit payments stated in the policy, the final payment shall be equal to the difference between a benefit payment and the initial prorated payment.

(i) As used in this section, “benefit payment” means payment of an amount equal to a loan repayment installment or a maximum amount established in the contract of insurance, whichever is less.

(j)  The minimum benefit payment offered may not be less than the amount of a loan repayment installment unless the borrower or borrowers have two or more sources of income. If the maximum benefit payment offered is less than the amount of a loan repayment installment, the borrower shall also be offered coverage in which the maximum benefit payment is equal to the amount of a loan repayment installment.



######### 18293.  
If credit disability or loss-of-income insurance is provided pursuant to this division, the industrial loan company shall also deliver an understandable written statement to the borrower detailing the conditions when the borrower will be entitled to make a claim under the insurance policy and the procedure to be followed in making the claim.

(5) The insurance is placed at standard rates through a title insurance company authorized to do business in the State of California;

(6) In connection with the renewal or extension of a loan, the additional cash advance is at least one thousand dollars ($1,000).

(2) The average daily unpaid balance of the open-end account in the billing cycle for which the charge is made, which is the sum of the amount unpaid each day during that cycle divided by the number of days in that cycle.

######### 18345.  
An industrial loan company shall notify the commissioner of every change in the officers, directors and management personnel of the company and of each branch of the company within 15 days of such change.

(B) That the person’s continuing to serve as a subject person of the industrial loan company may pose a material threat to the interest of the industrial loan company’s account holders or may threaten to materially impair public confidence in the industrial loan company. In case the criminal proceedings are terminated other than by a judgment of conviction the order shall be deemed rescinded.

(2) If the commissioner finds the following, the commissioner may immediately issue an order suspending or removing a subject person of an industrial loan company or a former subject of an industrial loan company, from his or her office, if any, with the industrial loan company and prohibiting the person from further participating in any manner in the conduct of the business of the industrial loan company, except with the prior consent of the industrial loan company:

(g) Any person to whom an order is issued under subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e) may apply to the commissioner to modify or rescind that order.

(3) If the commissioner believes that any person has violated paragraph (1), the commissioner may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction petitioning the court to assess that person a civil penalty in an amount as the commissioner may specify; provided, however, that the amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for each violation or, in the case of a continuing violation, two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for each day for which the violation continues.

In determining the amount of a civil penalty to be assessed under this paragraph, the court shall consider the financial resources and good faith of the person charged, the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations by the person, and such other factors as in the opinion of the court may be relevant.



######### 18350.  
Each industrial loan company shall pay to the commissioner its pro rata share of all costs and expenses of the department in administering this division and other laws relating to industrial loan companies or the industrial loan business, as estimated by the commissioner for the ensuing year and of any deficit actually incurred or anticipated in the year in which the assessment is made. The pro rata share shall be the proportion which a company’s assets bear to the aggregate assets of all companies as shown by the latest annual reports of the companies to the commissioner. The pro rata share shall not include the costs of any examinations provided for in Section 18392, unless they cannot be collected from the company examined.

If an industrial loan company fails to pay the assessment provided in Section 18350 on or before the 30th day of December following the day upon which payment is due, the commissioner may by order summarily suspend or revoke the certificate issued to that company. If, after such an order is made, a request for hearing is filed in writing within 15 days from the date of service of the order and a hearing is not held within 60 days thereafter, the order is deemed rescinded as of its effective date. During any period when its certificate is revoked or suspended, a company shall not issue thrift certificates or make loans or otherwise conduct business pursuant to this division except as may be permitted by order of the commissioner; provided, however, that neither the revocation, suspension or surrender of a certificate shall affect the powers of the commissioner as provided in this division.

If the company fails to make good the alleged deficiency or impairment of capital, the commissioner may forthwith take possession of the property and business of the industrial loan company pursuant to Section 18415. If the company fails to make good the alleged deficiency or impairment of capital within 60 days of the date of the order, the commissioner shall take possession of the industrial loan company pursuant to Section 18415. The capital of an industrial loan company is impaired when the minimum amount of capital required by Sections 18130 and 18131 is reduced by a net deficit balance in the company’s surplus account.



######### 18358.  
If it appears to the commissioner that an industrial loan company is conducting business in an unsafe, unsound, or injurious manner, the commissioner may, by written order, direct the discontinuance of any such unsafe or injurious practices.

The filing of that request shall not operate to postpone or suspend the effectiveness of any order issued by the commissioner unless otherwise directed by the commissioner. The order may be amended or set aside by the commissioner at any time. The commissioner shall, within 30 business days after the receipt of that written request or at a later time as may be mutually agreed with the company, cause that matter to be heard.



######### 18361.  
After any order is made final, the industrial loan company shall have 10 days in which suit may be commenced to restrain enforcement of such order and unless such action is commenced and enforcement of the final order is enjoined within 10 days by the court in which such suit is brought, the company shall comply with the final order.



######### 18362.  
(a) If the commissioner believes that an industrial loan company or its directors, officers, agents, or employees have violated or are about to violate any of the provisions of this division, or any provision of an order, license, permit, decision, demand, or requirement of the commissioner, the commissioner may bring an action against such persons to enjoin those persons from continuing the violation or the attempt to violate this division, or doing any act in furtherance thereof. The commissioner shall bring such action in the name of the people in the superior court, and the court may enter an order or judgment awarding a preliminary or final injunction as is proper.

(b) If the commissioner determines it is in the public interest, the commissioner may include in any action authorized by subdivision (a) a claim for ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, a claim for restitution or disgorgement or damages on behalf of the persons injured by the act or practice constituting the subject matter of the action, and the court shall have jurisdiction to award the additional relief.

(c) Any person who violates any provision of this division, or who violates any rule or order adopted pursuant to this division, shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for each violation, which shall be assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the people of the State of California by the commissioner in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(d) As applied to civil and criminal penalties for acts in violation of this division, the remedies provided by this section and by other sections of this division are not exclusive, and may be sought and employed in any combination to enforce the provisions of this division.



######### 18363.  
The commissioner may order an industrial loan company to suspend the redemption of investment certificates or the payment of the liabilities of the company or limit the payment of the liabilities in such manner as he prescribes, if it appears to the commissioner that such action is necessary for the protection of the company, its investors or creditors, or in the public interest. The order is effective upon receipt of notice by the company and continues in effect until rescinded or modified by the commissioner in a writing delivered to the manager or executive officer of the company. Nothing in this section shall affect the right of any company to pay its current operating expenses and liabilities incurred during the period of suspension or limitation.



######### 18364.  
After an order of suspending or limiting the payment of liabilities is effective and until that order is rescinded, the industrial loan company shall make no assignment or hypothecation of any indebtedness due to it from an investor without first crediting thereon the investment liability of the company to such investor-borrower.



######### 18365.  
The authority granted to the commissioner by Section 18363, may be exercised by him in conjunction with all other powers granted by this chapter, or independently from them.



######### 18366.  
Every order, decision, license, or other official act of the commissioner is subject to review in accordance with law. Upon review, the burden of proof lies upon the appellant, and the court shall receive and consider any pertinent evidence which was introduced in the formal hearing before the commissioner, whether oral or documentary, concerning the action of the commissioner under review. The review is limited to a consideration and determination of the question of whether there has been an abuse of discretion on the part of the commissioner in making such order, decision, finding, requirement, or rule.



######### 18367.  
(a) If at any time the commissioner is of the opinion that the further sale of investment certificates by an industrial loan company would be unfair, unjust or inequitable to the purchasers of its investment certificates, the commissioner may, notwithstanding any other provision of this division, order the company to desist and refrain from the further sale of its investment certificates.

(b) The company named in any order issued pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section may, within 15 days after receipt thereof, file with the commissioner its written request for hearing. The filing of such request shall not operate to postpone or suspend the effectiveness of any order issued by the commissioner unless otherwise directed by the commissioner. The commissioner shall, within 15 days after the receipt of such written request or at such later time as may be mutually agreed with the company, cause such matter to be heard and shall thereafter issue his final decision. Such decision may be amended or set aside by the commissioner at any time.

(c) Every order or decision of the commissioner made pursuant to this section is subject to judicial review in accordance with law.



######### 18368.  
(a) The commissioner may make the agreements that he or she deems necessary or appropriate in exercising his or her powers.

(b) (1) The agreements authorized under subdivision (a) may include, but are not limited to, agreements with agencies of this state, of other states of the United States, or of the United States that regulate financial institutions, relating to examinations of industrial loan companies and other matters.

(2) Any agreement with a government agency that regulates financial institutions is exempt from the advertising and competitive bidding requirements of the Public Contract Code.

For the purposes of examination and investigation, the commissioner and the commissioner’s duly designated representatives shall have free access to the offices and places of business, books, accounts, papers, records, files, safes and vaults of all such corporations and their holding companies or affiliates.

The liquidator shall cause notice to be given by publication for four successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation at or near the principal place of business in the state of the company, to all persons having claims against the company, other than investment certificate holders, whether or not an action is pending to enforce any claim for demand, requiring them to present and file their claims and make legal proof thereof at a place and within a time designated in the notice. The time shall not be less than 90 days after the first publication of the notice. The notice shall also state that all claims other than those of investment certificate holders appearing upon the books or records of the company and any claims, whether or not an action is pending to enforce any such claim or demand, shall be forever barred if not filed within the time designated.

If the liquidator doubts the validity of any claim, the liquidator may reject the claim and serve notice of rejection upon the claimant either by certified mail or personally.

Any action upon a claim so rejected must be brought within 30 days after the mailing of the notice or personal service of the notice in the court in which the liquidation proceeding is pending for an order to show cause why the claim should not be allowed. Failure to bring such action within 30 days to enforce the payment of or establish any rejected claim shall forever bar any such action.

A claim shall set forth, under oath, on the form prescribed by the commissioner, all of the following:

(b) Whether the claim is secured or unsecured, and, if secured, the nature and amount of the security.

The amount of a claim of an investment certificate holder shall be the amount which the investment certificate holder would have been entitled to withdraw as of the date of taking possession, pursuant to Section 18415, plus interest thereon accrued to that date, without regard to whether the account is subject to any pledge. In the case of an account with a fixed or minimum term or a qualifying or notice period that has not expired as of the date of taking possession, interest shall be computed as if the account had been withdrawn on that date without penalty or reduction in interest.

The liquidator shall give notice to each investment certificate holder of the amount of his or her claim and the investment certificate holder shall not be required to file a claim unless he or she disputes the amount of the liquidator’s determination.



######### 18425.7.  
When the time fixed for the presentation of claims has expired, the liquidator shall make in duplicate a full and complete list of all claims presented, including and specifying those claims that have been rejected by the liquidator, and a list of all claims of investment certificate holders as shown by the books or records of the company, and shall file one copy of the list in the commissioner’s office and one with the clerk of the superior court in which the liquidation proceedings are being held. Before each application to the court for leave to declare a dividend, the liquidator shall file a supplemental list of claims presented since the last preceding list was filed, including and specifying the claims as have been rejected by the liquidator. The list of claims and of claims of investment certificate holders as shown by the books or records of the company shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times.

Such deposits, certificates, or a clean and irrevocable letter or letters of credit shall be held in trust for the benefit of the insureds, as their relative interests in such downpayments may exist at any given time, and in the event of the insolvency of a company, such funds on deposit under the provisions of this section or as represented by a certificate or certificates of deposit or a clean and irrevocable letter or letters of credit shall be first applied to remitting the amount of the downpayment to the insureds on all premium finance agreements upon which the company has not then forwarded in full the downpayments collected from and then being held for insureds, and, if insufficient to pay all such amounts in full, then such funds shall be applied for such purposes pro rata.



######### 18594.  
Any corporation organized as an industrial loan company other than a premium finance agency shall conduct any insurance premium financing business under the authority of this chapter and it shall be subject to all of the provisions of this chapter in respect to such business, as if it were a premium finance agency.

######### 18606.  
A premium finance agreement shall not be executed by or on behalf of the insured when it contains any blank space to be filled in thereafter; however, if any insurance contract, premiums for which are advanced or to be advanced under the agreement, has not been issued at the time of execution and the premium finance agreement so provides, the name of the insurer, the policy number and the due date of the first installment may be left blank and inserted later. In connection with the financing of an additional premium or policies, upon the completion of the computations necessary to determine the amount of the revised unpaid balance and the number and amount of future installment payments, the company shall mail notice of the changes to the insured at his address shown in the agreement. The notice of the revised finance agreement shall set forth:

(a) The unpaid balance, as adjusted.

(b) The number and frequency of each installment under the revised finance agreement.

(c) The amount of each installment.

######### 18607.  
Upon receipt of the loan form the company shall promptly mail to the insured at the address shown in the agreement, or deliver to the insured personally, either a notice to the effect that the application for a loan is rejected or a copy of the agreement, thereby signifying acceptance by the company, or if the agreement contained any blank space when it was executed by or on behalf of the insured and such blank space was subsequently filled in, a copy of the agreement as so filled in and the insured shall in such event have 10 days in which to disaffirm his obligation under the premium finance agreement by giving written notice thereof to the producer and the company. In the event the agreement is not disaffirmed by the insured, the agreement shall be as binding an obligation of the insured as if the agreement were complete on its face when it was executed.

In no instance shall the effective date of cancellation be prior to that established by the company.



######### 18610.  
The insurer within a reasonable time after the effective date of cancellation shall return whatever gross unearned premiums or accrued dividends are payable under the insurance contract to the company, which financed the insurance contract, for the benefit of the insured. Whenever any funds are received by the company which are in excess of the amount due to the company, such an excess shall be remitted promptly to the insured or to his order or to the insurance agent for the account of the insured.

##### ARTICLE 4. Limitation on Finance Charges [18625 - 18631]  

######### 18625.  
A premium finance agency shall not, except as otherwise provided by law, impose, take, receive, reserve or charge a finance charge which in the aggregate is greater than that which is permitted by this article.



######### 18626.  
A premium finance agency may, in a premium finance agreement, contract for, charge, receive, and collect a finance charge which shall not exceed in the aggregate:

(a) Two percent per month on that part of the unpaid principal balance of any loan up to, including, but not in excess of, one thousand dollars ($1,000).

(b) One percent per month on any remainder of such unpaid principal balance in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000).

As used in this article “consumer insurance premium finance loan” shall mean an insurance premium finance loan where the insurance policies which are security for the loan are for personal, family or household use.

(c) As an alternative to the charges authorized by subdivisions (a) and (b), a premium finance agency may contract for and receive charges at a rate not exceeding 1.6 percent per month on the unpaid principal balance.



######### 18627.  
If the finance charge computed under Section 18626 is less than twenty-five dollars ($25), a minimum finance charge of twenty-five dollars ($25) may be imposed.



######### 18628.  
The finance charge may be computed from the effective date of the insurance coverage, provided that the company shall pay the premium due the insurer, either:

(a) Within 30 days from the effective date of the insurance coverage; or

(b) Within 30 days after the receipt by the company of a proper premium finance agreement; or

(c) Within 15 days after the company has mailed to the insured, notice of a revised finance agreement pursuant to Section 18606 whichever is later.

If the conditions of subdivision (a), (b), or (c) are not met the finance charge shall be computed from the date the proceeds of the loan are forwarded to the insurer. In the event the company receives a proper premium finance agreement later than 60 days from the effective date of the policy financed, a proportioned adjustment of the finance charge shall be made after such 60-day period.



######### 18629.  
Notwithstanding the provisions of any premium finance agreement to the contrary, any insured may pay the obligation in full at any time before maturity of the final installment. If he does so, he shall receive a refund credit of the unearned finance charge computed in accordance with Section 18635 or 18637, except where the amount of the refund credit is less than one dollar ($1) no refund need be made, and except that where the earned finance charge amounts to less than the minimum finance charge permitted by Section 18627, the company may retain as an earned finance charge a sum equal to the minimum permitted by Section 18627 or the maximum prescribed by Section 18627, whichever is applicable.



######### 18630.  
In the event that the insurance policy or policies which are the subject of a premium finance agreement are canceled by the insured or by the insurer, for any cause, the insured shall be entitled to receive a refund credit of the unearned finance charge. This refund credit shall be calculated in the same manner as prescribed in Section 18629, and shall be paid to the insured within a reasonable time.



######### 18631.  
(a) A premium finance agreement may provide for the payment of a default charge of one dollar ($1) to a maximum of 5 percent of the delinquent installment, in the event of a default for a period of not less than 10 days in the payment of any scheduled installment under the terms of a premium finance agreement. That charge may not be collected more than once for the same default and may be collected at the time of the default or at any time thereafter. If the default charge is deducted from any payment received after default occurs, and the deduction results in the default of a subsequent installment, no charge may be made for the resulting default.

(b) A premium finance agreement may provide for the payment of a dishonored check fee not to exceed fifteen dollars ($15) for actual expenses incurred in the processing of a dishonored check.








##### ARTICLE 5. Charges on Scheduled Balances [18634 - 18643]  

######### 18634.  
This article is applicable only to premium finance agencies.



######### 18635.  
Whenever the interest or charges, or interest and charges deducted in advance exceed the maximum provided by this division, by reason of subsequent repayment of the loan, a new loan, refinancing, or otherwise, or any portion thereof prior to maturity, such excess shall be rebated to the borrower or credited on any balance owing by the borrower to the company. The rebate shall be the difference between the total of the precomputed charge, any charge for extending the first due date, plus any default or deferment charges and the charges at the contract rate computed on unpaid principal balances for the number of days actually elapsed by applying each payment first to charges and the remainder to principal. The tender, by the borrower or at his request, of an amount equal to the unpaid balance less the required rebate must be accepted by the company in full payment of the loan contract.



######### 18636.  
(a) As an alternative to the provisions of Section 18635, if a loan is repayable in substantially equal and consecutive monthly installments of principal and charges combined, the first of which is due not less than 15 days nor more than one month and 15 days from the date the loan is made, a company may precompute charges and apply payments as provided in this article.

(b) The total charges which would be earned if the loan contract were repaid exactly according to its terms, at the monthly rate stated in the loan contract, may be precomputed when the loan is made and added to the principal of the loan. Every payment may be applied to the combined total of principal and precomputed charges until the loan contract is fully paid.

(c) The portion of the precomputed charge applicable to any particular monthly installment period shall bear the same ratio to the total precomputed charge, excluding any adjustment made for a first period of more or less than one month, as the balance scheduled to be outstanding during that monthly period bears to the sum of all monthly balances scheduled originally by the loan contract.



######### 18637.  
If a loan contract made under Section 18636 is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, refinancing or otherwise before the final installment date, the borrower shall receive a rebate of the portion of the precomputed charge applicable to the full installment periods following the installment date nearest the date of such prepayment; provided, however, that if prepayment in full occurs on or before the third installment date the rebate shall be the difference between the total precomputed charge and the charges at the contract rate computed on unpaid principal balances by applying each payment first to charges and the remainder to principal. After the third installment date, any prepayment made on or before the 15th day following an installment date shall be deemed to have been made on the installment date preceding such prepayment. The tender, by the borrower or at his request, of an amount equal to the unpaid balance less the required rebate must be accepted by the company in full payment of the loan contract.



######### 18638.  
A special rebate of precomputed charges shall be made if three or more, but not all, installments are prepaid in full at any one time either in one transaction or over a period of time on a loan made under Section 18636. The special rebate shall be equal to the portion of precomputed charge applicable to the last installment period multiplied by the total number of full installment periods such installments and any subsequent installments are prepaid. Such special rebate shall be computed and made at the termination of the loan contract and shall be an addition to any required rebate for prepayment in full.



######### 18640.  
A deferment charge may be charged and collected on a loan made under Section 18636 if the payment date of all wholly unpaid installments on which no default charge has been collected is deferred one or more full months and the loan contract so provides. Such deferment charge shall not exceed the portion of precomputed charge applicable, prior to deferment, to the first deferred monthly installment period multiplied by the number of months the maturity of the contract is deferred. Such number of months shall not exceed the number of full installments which are in default on the date of deferment or which may become due within 15 days of such date. When a deferment charge is made, no portion of the precomputed charge shall apply to the installment periods in which no installment payment is required by reason of the deferment. In computing any default charge or required rebate, the portion of the precomputed charge applicable to each deferred balance and installment period following the deferment period and prior to the deferred maturity shall remain the same as that applicable to such balances and periods under the original contract of loan. Such charge may be collected at the time of deferment or at any time thereafter. Any payment received at the time of deferment may be applied first to the deferment charge and the remainder, if any, applied to the unpaid balance of the loan contract; provided, however, if such payment is sufficient to pay, in addition to the appropriate deferment charge, any installment which is in default and the applicable default charge, it shall be first so applied and any such installment shall not be deferred nor subject to the deferment charge.



######### 18642.  
If the maturity of a loan made under Section 18636 is accelerated for any reason, the company shall make the same refund or credit as would be required if the loan contract was paid in full on the date of acceleration and the unpaid balance shall be treated as the unpaid principal balance and thereafter the unpaid balance of the loan contract shall bear charges at the agreed rate of charge if the loan contract so provides.



######### 18643.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law not within this article, with respect to precomputed loans, premium finance agencies derive authority only from this article.

An organization that is accepted as a data furnisher after being granted an exemption by the commissioner pursuant to this subdivision shall report all borrower payment performance since its inception of lending under the program, as soon as practicable after its acceptance into the program, but in no event more than six months after its acceptance into the program.

(9) The organization shall underwrite each loan and shall ensure that a loan is not made if, through its underwriting, the organization determines that the borrower’s total monthly debt service payments, at the time of loan origination, including the loan for which the borrower is being considered, and across all outstanding forms of credit that can be independently verified by the organization, exceed 50 percent of the borrower’s gross monthly household income except as specified in clause (iii) of subparagraph (D).

(A) The organization shall seek information and documentation pertaining to all of a borrower’s outstanding debt obligations during the loan application and underwriting process, including loans that are self-reported by the borrower but not available through independent verification. The organization shall verify that information using a credit report from at least one consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis or through other available electronic debt verification services that provide reliable evidence of a borrower’s outstanding debt obligations.

(B) The organization shall also request from the borrower and include all information obtained from the borrower regarding outstanding deferred deposit transactions in the calculation of the borrower’s outstanding debt obligations.

(C) The organization shall not be required to consider, for purposes of debt-to-income ratio evaluation, loans from friends or family.

(D) The organization shall also verify the borrower’s household income that the organization relies on to determine the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio using information from any of the following:

(i) Electronic means or services that provide reliable evidence of the borrower’s actual income.

(ii) Internal Revenue Service Form W-2, tax returns, payroll receipts, bank statements, or other third-party documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of the borrower’s actual income.

(iii)  A signed statement from the borrower stating sources and amounts of income, if the borrower’s actual income cannot be independently verified using electronic means or services, Internal Revenue Service forms, tax returns, payroll receipts, bank statements, or other third-party documents. If income is verified using a signed statement from a borrower, a loan shall not be made if the borrower’s total monthly debt service payments, at the time of loan origination, including the loan for which the borrower is being considered, and across all outstanding forms of credit, exceed 25 percent of the borrower’s gross monthly household income.

(10) The organization shall notify each borrower, at least two days prior to each payment due date, informing the borrower of the amount due and the payment due date. Notification may be provided by any means mutually acceptable to the borrower and the organization. A borrower shall have the right to opt out of this notification at any time, upon electronic or written request to the organization. The organization shall notify each borrower of this right prior to disbursing loan proceeds.

(11) Notwithstanding Sections 22311 to 22315, inclusive, no organization, in connection with, or incidental to, the facilitating of any loan made pursuant to this section, may offer, sell, or require a borrower to contract for “credit insurance” as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 22314 or insurance on tangible personal or real property of the type specified in Section 22313.

(12) An organization shall not require, as a condition of making a loan, that a borrower waive any right, penalty, remedy, forum, or procedure provided for in any law applicable to the loan, including the right to file and pursue a civil action or file a complaint with or otherwise communicate with the commissioner or any court or other public entity, or that the borrower agree to resolve disputes in a jurisdiction outside of California or to the application of laws other than those of California, as provided by law. Any waiver by a borrower must be knowing, voluntary, and in writing, and expressly not made a condition of doing business with the organization. Any waiver that is required as a condition of doing business with the organization shall be presumed involuntary, unconscionable, against public policy, and unenforceable. The organization has the burden of proving that a waiver of any rights, penalties, forums, or procedures was knowing, voluntary, and not made a condition of the contract with the borrower.

(13) An organization shall not refuse to do business with or discriminate against a borrower or applicant on the basis that the borrower or applicant refuses to waive any right, penalty, remedy, forum, or procedure, including the right to file and pursue a civil action or complaint with, or otherwise notify, the commissioner or any court or other public entity. The exercise of a person’s right to refuse to waive any right, penalty, remedy, forum, or procedure, including a rejection of a contract requiring a waiver, shall not affect any otherwise legal terms of a contract or an agreement.

(14) This section does not apply to any agreement to waive any right, penalty, remedy, forum, or procedure, including any agreement to arbitrate a claim or dispute, after a claim or dispute has arisen. This section does not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision of the contract.

(d) This division does not apply to a nonprofit organization that partners with an organization granted an exemption pursuant to subdivision (c) for the purpose of facilitating zero-interest, low-cost loans, provided that the requirements of paragraphs (6) to (14), inclusive, of subdivision (c), and the following additional conditions are met:

######### 22203.  
“Consumer loan” means a loan, whether secured by either real or personal property, or both, or unsecured, the proceeds of which are intended by the borrower for use primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. For purposes of determining whether a loan is a consumer loan, the lender may rely on any written statement of intended purposes signed by the borrower. The statement may be a separate statement signed by the borrower, or may be contained in a loan application or other document signed by the borrower. The lender shall not be required to ascertain that the proceeds of the loan are used in accordance with the statement of intended purposes. Nothing in this section shall authorize the taking of real property as security, except as specified in Section 22330.



######### 22204.

For purposes of determining whether a loan is or is not a consumer loan, the lender may rely on any written statement of intended purposes signed by the borrower. The statement may be a separate statement signed by the borrower or may be contained in a loan application or other document signed by the borrower. The lender shall not be required to ascertain that the proceeds of the loan are used in accordance with the statement of intended purposes.

##### ARTICLE 2. Exemptions [22250 - 22252]  

######### 22250.  
(a) The following sections do not apply to any loan of a bona fide principal amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or more, or to a duly licensed finance lender in connection with any such loan or loans, if the provisions of this section are not used for the purpose of evading this division: Sections 22154, 22155, 22201, 22202, 22307, 22313, 22314, 22315, 22322, 22323, 22325, 22334, and 22752, and the sections enumerated in subdivision (b).

(b) The following sections do not apply to any loan of a bona fide principal amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000) or more, or to a duly licensed finance lender in connection with any such loan or loans, if the provisions of this section are not used for the purpose of evading this division: Sections 22300, 22305, and 22306, subdivision (a) of Section 22307, and Sections 22309, 22320.5, 22326, 22327, 22400, and 22751.



######### 22251.  
Any section that refers to this section does not apply to any loan of the bona fide principal amount specified in the regulatory ceiling provision of that section or more if that provision is not used for the purpose of evading this division. In determining under Section 22250, 22303, 22304, or 22304.5 or any section that refers to this section whether a loan is a loan of a bona fide principal amount of the amount specified in that section or more and whether the regulatory ceiling provision of that section is used for the purpose of evading this division, the following principles apply:

(a) If a borrower applies for a loan in a bona fide principal amount of less than the specified amount and a loan to that borrower of a bona fide principal amount of the specified amount or more is made by a licensed finance lender, no adequate economic reason for the increase in the size of the loan exists, and by prearrangement or understanding between the borrower and the licensee a substantial payment is to be made upon the loan with the effect of reducing the bona fide principal amount of the loan to less than the specified amount within a short time after the making of the loan other than by reason of a requirement that the loan be paid in substantially equal periodical installments, then the loan shall not be deemed to be a loan of the bona fide principal amount of the specified amount or more and the regulatory ceiling provisions shall be deemed to be used for the purpose of evading this division unless the loan complies with the other provisions of the section that includes the regulatory ceiling provisions.

(b) If a loan made by a licensed finance lender is in a bona fide principal amount of the specified amount or more, the fact that the transaction is in the form of a sale of accounts, chattel paper, goods, or instruments or a lease of goods, or in the form of an advance on the purchase price of any of the foregoing, shall not be deemed to affect the loan or the bona fides of the amount thereof or to indicate that the regulatory ceiling provisions are used for the purpose of evading this division.

(c) For the purposes of determining whether the loan amount exceeds a regulatory ceiling, the “bona fide principal amount” shall not be comprised of any charges or any other fees or recompense specified in Sections 22200, 22201, 22202, 22305, 22316, 22317, 22318, 22319, 22320, 22320.5, and 22336, or any amounts paid for insurance of the types specified in Sections 22313 and 22314, or any fees paid to a licensee for the privilege of participating in an open-end credit program. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to prevent those specified charges, fees, and recompense that have been earned and remain unpaid in an existing loan from being considered as part of the bona fide principal amount of a new loan to refinance that existing loan, provided the new loan is not made for the purpose of circumventing a regulatory ceiling provision. This subdivision is intended to define the meaning of “bona fide principal amount” as used in this division solely for the purposes of determining whether the loan amount exceeds a regulatory ceiling, and is not intended to affect the meaning of “principal” for any other purpose.



######### 22252.  
This chapter does not apply to a program administrator or a PACE solicitor.

(b) As used in this section, “Federal Funds Rate” means the rate published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in its Statistical Release H.15 Selected Interest Rates and in effect as of the first day of the month immediately preceding the month during which the loan is consummated. If the Federal Reserve System ceases publication of the federal funds rate, the commissioner shall designate a substantially equivalent index.

A credit education program or seminar may be provided in writing, electronically, or orally, but, if provided orally, shall be accompanied by written or electronic materials that a prospective borrower can retain or access following the conclusion of the program or seminar.

In addition to the charges authorized by Section 22303, 22304, or 22304.5, a licensee may contract for and receive an administrative fee, which shall be fully earned immediately upon making the loan, with respect to a loan of a bona fide principal amount of not more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) at a rate not in excess of 5 percent of the principal amount (exclusive of the administrative fee) or fifty dollars ($50), whichever is less, and with respect to a loan of a bona fide principal amount in excess of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), at an amount not to exceed seventy-five dollars ($75). No administrative fee may be contracted for or received in connection with the refinancing of a loan unless at least one year has elapsed since the receipt of a previous administrative fee paid by the borrower. Only one administrative fee may be contracted for or received until the loan has been repaid in full. For purposes of this section, “bona fide principal amount” shall be determined in accordance with Section 22251.



######### 22306.  
No amount in excess of that allowed by this article shall be directly or indirectly charged, contracted for, or received by any person, and the total charges of the finance lender and broker and any other person in the aggregate shall not exceed the maximum rate provided for in this article.



######### 22307.  
(a) Except as provided in Section 22305 and Article 4 (commencing with Section 22400), all charges on loans made under this division shall be computed and paid only as a percentage per month of the unpaid principal balance or portions thereof, and shall be so expressed in every obligation signed by the borrower. The charges on loans shall be computed on the basis of the number of days actually elapsed. For the purpose of these computations, a month is any period of 30 consecutive days.

A licensee shall not charge, impose, or receive any penalty for the prepayment of a loan. This section does not apply to a loan secured by real property.



######### 22308.  
Notwithstanding Section 22307, a licensee may contract for and receive charges on the unpaid principal balance at a single annual percentage rate, applied on the basis of the number of days actually elapsed, if the annual rate would produce a finance charge at the maturity of the contract not in excess of the finance charge resulting from the application of the graduated rates specified in Section 22303, when the loan is paid according to its terms, and charges are computed on the basis that a month is any period of 30 consecutive days, as provided in Section 22307; provided, however, that if prepayment in full occurs on or before the third installment date, all charges shall be recomputed as a percentage per month of the unpaid principal balance or portions thereof, based on the number of days actually elapsed.



######### 22309.  
Except as provided in Section 22305 and Article 4 (commencing with Section 22400), no charges on loans made pursuant to this division shall be paid, deducted, or received in advance, or compounded. However, if part or all of the consideration for a new loan contract is the unpaid balance of a prior loan, the principal amount payable under the new loan contract may include any unpaid interest that has accrued on the prior loan. The unpaid principal balance of a precomputed loan is the balance due after refund or credit of unearned interest as provided in Section 22400. At the time of making the loan, the licensee shall deliver to the borrower, or, at the direction of the borrower, deliver to another person, an amount equal to the face value of the loan and the note evidencing the loan.



######### 22310.  
(a) Except for a rebate or refund pursuant to any administrative, civil, or criminal action, or any act of the commissioner, a rebate or refund required to be made upon payment in full of a loan pursuant to this division need not be made if the aggregate of all rebates or refunds required in connection with a loan is less than one dollar ($1).

(b) No licensee shall contract for or receive any payment required in connection with a loan for the purpose of avoiding a rebate or refund of less than one dollar ($1).



######### 22311.  
No person in connection with or incidental to the making of any loan regulated by this division may require the borrower to contract for purchase, or agree to purchase, any other thing in connection with the loan. A policy of insurance of the type specified in Section 22313 and credit life and disability insurance is not prohibited by this section. A policy of insurance of the type defined by subdivision (a) of Section 12640.02 of the Insurance Code shall not be deemed to be a collateral sale, purchase, or agreement within the terms of this section or of Section 22201 or 22312.



######### 22312.  
No person in connection with or incidental to the making of a loan shall require the borrower to enter into any collateral sales agreements or contracts, other than the contract of pledge, assignment, or mortgage or personal property, or if otherwise permitted by this division, the deed of trust, mortgage, or lien on real property, by the borrower to the lender as security for the repayment of the loan and charges on the loan. Insurance of the type specified in Section 22313, credit life insurance, and credit disability insurance are not prohibited by this section.



######### 22313.

(a) The insurance is sold at standard rates through licensed insurance brokers or agents.

(b) The policy is written to cover the property that is offered as security for a loan.

(c) The property is reasonably insured against loss for a reasonable term, which may be up to the term of the loan.

(d) The policy relating to personal property is made payable to the borrower or any member of his or her family even though the customary mortgagee clause is attached or the mortgagee is a coassured.

(e) Except in the case of purchase money encumbrances, the amount of title insurance shall not exceed the principal amount of the loan that is secured by a deed of trust, mortgage, or lien on the real property that is the subject of the policy of title insurance.

(f) The policy of title insurance insures the lender or is made payable jointly to the lender and the borrower as their interests may appear.

(g) Title insurance is placed through a title insurance company, duly authorized to do business in the state in which the real property is located, at rates comparable to rates being used by other title insurance companies duly authorized to do business in that state.

(h) Title insurance is placed in connection with the renewal or extension of a loan only when the additional cash advance is at least one thousand dollars ($1,000).

This section does not apply to any loan of a bona fide principal amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or more, or to a duly licensed finance lender in connection with any such loan or loans as determined in accordance with Section 22251.



######### 22314.  
(a) Credit insurance shall not be deemed to be a collateral sale, purchase, or agreement within the terms of Section 22201, 22311, or 22312 when the insurance is provided in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Code and this section. As used in this division:

(1) “Credit insurance” means credit life, disability, and loss-of-income insurance, or any combination of these coverages.

(2) “Credit life insurance” and “credit disability insurance” have the same meanings as defined in Section 779.2 of the Insurance Code.

(b) A licensee may provide credit insurance with the borrower’s consent, the form to be approved by the Insurance Commissioner, and a copy, together with evidence of its approval by the Insurance Commissioner, and a copy of the schedule of rates together with evidence of its approval by the Insurance Commissioner, to be filed with the commissioner prior to the offer or sale of the credit insurance and in an amount not in excess of the amount of the indebtedness, and, with respect to credit life or disability insurance, may collect from the borrower an amount not in excess of that permitted by or pursuant to Section 779.36 of the Insurance Code.

(c) If the loan is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, refinancing, or otherwise (except by that insurance) before the final installment date, the borrower shall receive a rebate of that amount computed in accordance with the formula approved by the Insurance Commissioner pursuant to Section 779.14 of the Insurance Code.

(d) When charges for the loan are precomputed in accordance with Section 22400, any permitted deferment charge may be computed on the combined total of the precomputed charge and the credit insurance charge. Only one deferment charge may be collected in connection with any loan contract, irrespective of the number of borrowers, and only one borrower need be insured. The amount of the deferment charge may be deducted from the principal of the loan.

(e) If life or disability insurance is provided, and if the insured borrower dies or becomes disabled during the term of the loan contract, the insurance shall be sufficient to pay the total amount due on the loan, excluding unearned charges, outstanding on the date of death, or all amounts that become due on the loan during the period of disability, as the case may be, without any exception, reservation, or limitation, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 22315.

(f) Any credit insurance provided shall be in force as soon as the loan is made. A licensee shall not require credit insurance as a condition of making a loan.

The borrower shall not be charged for both an automated valuation model result and an appraisal as defined in Section 22317 for the same property in a single transaction. Only one fee for providing an automated valuation model result or an appraisal for the same real property may be collected unless the borrower has obtained a new or additional loan and more than one year has elapsed since the prior delivery of an automated valuation model result or an appraisal. However, if a fee for an automated valuation model result has been paid, an appraisal fee minus the amount that has been paid by the borrower for the automated valuation model result may be charged for an appraisal for the same real property within one year if the borrower has obtained a new or additional loan.

The notice shall specify that the borrower’s request for the automated valuation model result must be in writing and must be received by the licensee no later than 90 days after the licensee provides notice of the action taken on the application or a notice of incompleteness, or in the case of a withdrawn application, 90 days after the withdrawal. The notice shall also include the following statement: “An automated valuation model is not an appraisal. It is a computerized property valuation system that is used to derive a real property value.” An address to which the request should be sent shall be specified in the notice. Release of the automated valuation model result to the borrower may be conditioned upon payment of the fee.

(e) This section does not apply to automated valuation model results obtained by licensees on property owned by the licensee, nor to automated valuation model results obtained by the licensee in anticipation of modifying any existing loan agreement if the licensee does not charge for the use of the automated valuation model result.

The delinquency fee under this section is not included in charges defined in this division or in determining applicable maximum charges that may be made under this article.

(c) For open-end loans made under Article 5 (commencing with Section 22450), a licensee shall not collect or receive the delinquency fee set forth in subdivision (a) unless there is a minimum of 20 days, inclusive, between the monthly billing date and the date upon which the minimum payment is due, exclusive of the applicable grace period provided in subdivision (a).

The maximum benefits shall be established in the contract of insurance.

(e) If combination credit disability and credit loss-of-income coverage is offered, credit disability and credit loss-of-income coverage shall also be offered separately.

(f) Benefits may not be denied because the insured cannot establish a valid claim for unemployment compensation benefits under Part 1 (commencing with Section 100) of Division 1 of the Unemployment Insurance Code solely because the former employer was not required to contribute to the State Unemployment Fund.

(g) If insurance with retroactive coverage is provided, the coverage shall provide for a prorated payment based upon the fraction of the month during which the insured is unemployed, provided that the insured is continuously unemployed during the waiting period set forth in the policy.

(i) As used in this section, “benefit payment” means payment of an amount equal to a loan repayment installment or a maximum amount established in the contract of insurance, whichever is less.

(j) The minimum benefit payment offered may not be less than the amount of a loan repayment installment unless the borrower or borrowers have two or more sources of income. If the maximum benefit payment offered is less than the amount of a loan repayment installment, the borrower shall also be offered coverage in which the maximum benefit payment is equal to the amount of a loan repayment installment.

This section does not apply to any loan of a bona fide principal amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or more, or to a duly licensed finance lender in connection with any such loan or loans as determined in accordance with Section 22251.

(3) States that, upon written request, the licensee shall extend for an additional 10 days the redemption period or, if entitled to the conditional right of reinstatement, both the redemption and reinstatement periods. The licensee shall provide the proper form for applying for these extensions with the substance of the form being limited to the extension request, spaces for the requesting party to sign and date the form, and instructions that it must be personally served or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to a person or office and address designated by the licensee and received before the expiration of the initial redemption and reinstatement periods.

(4) Discloses the place at which the motor vehicle will be returned to the persons liable on the loan upon redemption or reinstatement.

(5) Designates the name and address of the person or office to whom payment shall be made.

(6) States the licensee’s intent to dispose of the motor vehicle upon the expiration of 15 days from the date of giving or mailing the notice, or if by mail and either the place of deposit in the mail or the place of address is outside of this state, the period shall be 20 days instead of 15 days, and further, that upon written request to extend the redemption period and any applicable reinstatement period for 10 days, the licensee shall, without further notice, extend the period accordingly.

(7) Informs the persons liable on the loan that, upon written request, the licensee shall furnish a written accounting regarding the disposition of the motor vehicle as provided for in subdivision (c). The licensee shall advise them that the request must be personally served or sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, or certified mail, return receipt requested, to a person or office and address designated by the licensee.

(8) Includes a notice, in at least 10-point bold type if the notice is printed, reading as follows: 

“NOTICE:  YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO SUIT AND LIABILITY IF THE AMOUNT OBTAINED UPON DISPOSITION OF THE VEHICLE IS INSUFFICIENT TO PAY THE LOAN BALANCE AND ANY OTHER AMOUNTS DUE.” 

(c) Unless automatically provided to the borrower within 45 days after the disposition of the motor vehicle, the licensee shall provide a written accounting regarding the disposition to any person liable on the loan within 45 days after their written request, if the request is made within one year after the disposition.

(b) (1) In the absence of default in the performance of any of the borrower’s obligations under the loan, the licensee may not accelerate the maturity of any part or all of the amount due thereunder or repossess the motor vehicle.

(2) Neither the act of filing a petition commencing a case for bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code by the borrower or other person liable on the loan nor the status of either of those persons as a debtor in bankruptcy constitutes a default in the performance of any of the borrower’s obligations under the loan, and neither may be used as a basis for accelerating the maturity of any part or all of the amount due under the loan or for repossessing the motor vehicle. A provision of a contract that states that the act of filing a petition commencing a case for bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code by the buyer or other individual liable on the contract or the status of either of those persons as a debtor in bankruptcy is a default is void and unenforceable.

(c) If, after default by the borrower, the licensee repossesses or voluntarily accepts surrender of the motor vehicle, any person liable on the loan shall have a right to reinstate the loan and the licensee shall not accelerate the maturity of any part or all of the loan prior to the expiration of the right to reinstate, unless the licensee reasonably and in good faith determines that:

(d) Exercise of the right to reinstate the loan shall be limited to once in any 12-month period and twice during the term of the loan.

(e) The provisions of this subdivision shall govern the method by which a loan shall be reinstated with respect to curing events of default that were grounds for repossession or that occurred subsequent to repossession.

(1) When the default is the result of the borrower’s failure to make any payment due under the loan, the borrower or any other person liable on the loan shall make the defaulted payments and pay any applicable delinquency charges.

(2) When the default is the result of the borrower’s failure to keep and maintain the motor vehicle free from all encumbrances and liens of every kind, the borrower or any person liable on the loan shall either satisfy all the encumbrances and liens or, in the event the licensee satisfies the encumbrances and liens, the borrower or any other person liable on the loan shall reimburse the licensee for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred therefor.

(3) When the default is the result of the borrower’s failure to keep and maintain insurance on the motor vehicle, the borrower or any other person liable on the loan shall either obtain the insurance or, in the event the licensee has obtained the insurance, the borrower or any other person liable on the loan shall reimburse the licensee for premiums paid and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred therefor.

(4) When the default is the result of the borrower’s failure to perform any other obligation under the loan, unless the licensee has made a good faith determination that the default is so substantial as to be incurable, the borrower or any other person liable on the loan shall reimburse the licensee for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred therefor.

(5) Additionally, the borrower or any other person liable on the loan shall reimburse the licensee for actual and necessary fees in an amount not exceeding the amount specified in subdivision (e) of Section 22202 paid in connection with the repossession of a motor vehicle to a repossession agency licensed pursuant to Chapter 11 (commencing with Section 7500) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code, and actual fees in conformity with Sections 26751 and 41612 of the Government Code in an amount not exceeding the amount specified in those sections of the Government Code.

(f) If the licensee denies the right to reinstatement under subdivision (c) or paragraph (4) of subdivision (e), the licensee shall have the burden of proof that the denial was justified in that it was reasonable and made in good faith. If the licensee fails to sustain the burden of proof, the licensee shall not be entitled to a deficiency.

A licensee that is accepted as a data furnisher after admittance into the program shall notify its borrowers, as soon as practicable following acceptance as a data furnisher, regarding the name of the consumer reporting agency or agencies to which it will report that borrower’s payment history.

(4) (A) The licensee shall underwrite each loan to determine a borrower’s ability and willingness to repay the loan pursuant to the loan terms, and shall not make a loan if it determines, through its underwriting, that the borrower’s total monthly debt service payments, at the time of origination, including the loan for which the borrower is being considered, and across all outstanding forms of credit that can be independently verified by the licensee, exceed 50 percent of   the borrower’s gross monthly income for a loan of no more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) or exceed 36 percent of the borrower’s gross monthly income for a loan in excess of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500).

(B) (i) The licensee shall seek information and documentation pertaining to all of a borrower’s outstanding debt obligations during the loan application and underwriting process, including loans that are self-reported by the borrower but not available through independent verification. The licensee shall verify that information using a credit report from at least one consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis or through other available electronic debt verification services that provide reliable evidence of a borrower’s outstanding debt obligations.

(ii) Notwithstanding the verification requirement in subparagraph (A), the licensee shall request from the borrower and include all information obtained from the borrower regarding outstanding deferred deposit transactions in the calculation of the borrower’s outstanding debt obligations.

(iii) The licensee shall not be required to consider, for purposes of debt-to-income ratio evaluation, loans from friends or family.

(C) The licensee shall also verify the borrower’s income that the licensee relies on to determine the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio using information from either of the following:

(i) Electronic means or services that provide reliable evidence of the borrower’s actual income.

(ii) Internal Revenue Service Form W-2, tax returns, payroll receipts, bank statements, or other third-party documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of the borrower’s actual income.

(5) The licensee shall notify each borrower, at least two days before each payment due date, informing the borrower of the amount due, and the payment due date. Notification may be provided by any means mutually acceptable to the borrower and the licensee. A borrower shall have the right to opt out of this notification at any time, upon electronic or written request to the licensee. The licensee shall notify each borrower of this right before disbursing loan proceeds.

(j) (1) Notwithstanding Sections 22311 to 22315, inclusive, no person, in connection with, or incidental to, the making of any loan made pursuant to this article, may offer, sell, or require the borrower to contract for “credit insurance” as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 22314 or insurance on tangible personal or real property of the type specified in Section 22313.

(2) Notwithstanding Sections 22311 to 22315, inclusive, no licensee, finder, or any other person that participates in the origination of a loan under this article shall refer a borrower to any other person for the purchase of “credit insurance” as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 22314 or insurance on tangible personal or real property of the type specified in Section 22313.

(k) (1) A licensee shall not require, as a condition of providing the loan, that the borrower waive any right, penalty, remedy, forum, or procedure provided for in any law applicable to the loan, including the right to file and pursue a civil action or file a complaint with or otherwise communicate with the commissioner or any court or other public entity, or that the borrower agree to resolve disputes in a jurisdiction outside of California or to the application of laws other than those of California, as provided by law. Any waiver by a borrower must be knowing, voluntary, and in writing, and expressly not made a condition of doing business with the licensee. Any waiver that is required as a condition of doing business with the licensee shall be presumed involuntary, unconscionable, against public policy, and unenforceable. The licensee has the burden of proving that a waiver of any rights, penalties, forums, or procedures was knowing, voluntary, and not made a condition of the contract with the borrower.

(2) A licensee shall not refuse to do business with or discriminate against a borrower or applicant on the basis that the borrower or applicant refuses to waive any right, penalty, remedy, forum, or procedure, including the right to file and pursue a civil action or complaint with, or otherwise notify, the commissioner or any court or other public entity.

##### ARTICLE 4. Charges On Scheduled Balances [22400 - 22402]  

######### 22400.  
This article applies only to loan contracts payable in substantially equal and consecutive monthly installments of principal and charges combined, the first of which is due not less than 15 days nor more than one month and 15 days from the date the loan is made. In lieu of computing charges and applying payments as provided in Section 22307, a licensee may precompute charges and apply payments as follows:

(a) The total charges which would be earned if the contract were repaid exactly according to its terms, at the monthly rate stated in the contract, may be precomputed when the loan is made and added to the principal of the loan. For the purpose of computation, a month shall be that period of time from any date in one month to the corresponding date in the next month, and if there is no corresponding date, then to the last day of the next month. The principal amount of the loan shall be its face value as referred to in Section 22309. Every payment may be applied to the combined total of principal and precomputed charges until the contract is fully paid. The acceptance of payment of charges on loans made under the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute payment deduction or receipt thereof in advance nor compounding under Section 22309. Precomputed charges shall be subject to the following adjustments:

(1) The portion of the precomputed charge applicable to any particular monthly installment period shall bear the same ratio to the total precomputed charge, excluding any adjustment made for a first period of more than one month, as the balance scheduled to be outstanding during that monthly period bears to the sum of all monthly balances scheduled originally by the loan contract.

(2) If the loan contract is paid in full by cash, a new loan, refinancing, or otherwise, the borrower shall receive a rebate of that portion of the precomputed charge that is the difference between the total precomputed charge and the charges at the contract rate computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 22307 or 22308. The tender, by the borrower or at his or her request, of an amount equal to the unpaid balance, less the required rebate, must be accepted by the licensee in full payment of the contract.

(3) If three or more, but not all, installments are prepaid in full at any one time, all of the prior charges for the loan shall be recalculated and all subsequent charges for the remaining term of the loan shall be recalculated by applying each payment first to charges and the remainder to principal in accordance with the provisions of Section 22307 or 22308.

(4) If the payment date of all wholly unpaid installments on which no default charge has been collected is deferred one or more full months and the contract so provides, the licensee may charge and collect a deferment charge. The deferment charge shall not exceed the portion of the precomputed charge applicable prior to deferment, to the first deferred monthly installment period multiplied by the number of months the maturity of the contract is deferred. The number of months shall not exceed the number of full installments that are in default on the date of deferment or that may become due within 15 days of that date. When a deferment charge is made, no portion of the precomputed charge shall apply to the installment periods in which no installment payment is required by reason of the deferment. In computing any default charge or required rebate, the portion of the precomputed charge applicable to each deferred balance and installment period following the deferment period and prior to the deferred maturity shall remain the same as that applicable to the balances and periods under the original loan contract. The charge may be collected at the time of deferment or at any time thereafter. Any payment received at the time of deferment may be applied first to the deferment charge and the remainder, if any, applied to the unpaid balance of the contract. However, if the payment is sufficient to pay, in addition to the appropriate deferment charge, any installment that is in default and the applicable default charge, it shall be first so applied and any such installment shall not be deferred nor subject to the deferment charge.

(5) In the event of default of more than 10 days in the payment of one-half or more of any scheduled installment, the licensee may charge and collect a default charge not exceeding an amount equal to the portion of the precomputed charge applicable to the final installment period. The charge may not be collected more than once for the same default and may be collected at the time of the default or at any time thereafter. If the default charge is deducted from any payment received after default occurs, and the deduction results in the default of a subsequent installment, no charge may be made for the resulting default.

(6) A borrower and licensee may agree that the first installment due date may be not more than 15 days more than one month and the amount of the installment may be increased by one-thirtieth of the portion of the precomputed charge applicable to a first installment of one month for each extra day.

(b) The statement to be given to the borrower as provided in subdivision (a) of Section 22337 and the contract shall disclose in addition to other required information the principal amount of the loan exclusive of charges and the basis for computing the refund of precomputed charges in case of prepayment in full or acceleration of maturity and for computing default and deferment charges. The delivery of a receipt of each payment showing the total amount of each payment complies with subdivision (d) of Section 22337.

(c) If the maturity of the contract when the charges are precomputed is accelerated for any reason, the licensee shall make the same refund or credit as would be required if the contract was paid in full on the date of acceleration. The unpaid balance shall be treated as the unpaid principal balance, and thereafter the unpaid balance of the contract shall bear charges at the agreed rate of charge if the loan contract so provides.



######### 22401.  
With respect to precomputed loans, licensees shall be subject only to, comply only with, and derive authority only from Sections 22400 and 22402, notwithstanding any other provision of law that is not within this division.



######### 22402.  
When charges on a loan of an original bona fide principal amount of five thousand ($5,000) or more have been precomputed in a manner similar to that provided in Section 22400, and the loan is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, refinancing, or otherwise, or the maturity of the loan contract is accelerated for any reason, the borrower shall receive a rebate or credit of that portion of the precomputed charge that is the difference between the total precomputed charge and the charges at the contract rate computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 22307 or 22308, or on the basis of 12 equal months of 30 days each, on the assumption that all payments were received by the licensee on their respective due dates. This section does not apply to charges paid by the borrower to the lender or others, such as charges computed as a percentage of the loan, that are fully earned upon making the loan, or to charges agreed to be paid by the borrower upon prepayment of a loan secured by a lien upon real property.








##### ARTICLE 5. Open-End Loan Programs [22450 - 22467]  

######### 22450.  
As used in this division, “open-end credit program” means a licensee’s plan for making open-end loans pursuant to a loan agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions governing the use of the open-end credit program, expressly states that the loan is made pursuant to this article, and provides that:

For purposes of determining whether a loan is a commercial loan, the lender may rely on any written statement of intended purposes signed by the borrower. The statement may be a separate statement signed by the borrower or may be contained in a loan application or other document signed by the borrower. The lender shall not be required to ascertain that the proceeds of the loan are used in accordance with the statement of intended purposes.








##### ARTICLE 2. Exemptions [22550 - 22552]

In determining whether a loan is a loan of a bona fide principal amount of the specified amount or more, the following principles shall apply:

(a) If a borrower applies for a loan in a bona fide principal amount of less than the specified amount and a loan to that borrower of a bona fide principal amount of the specified amount or more is made by a licensed finance lender, no adequate economic reason for the increase in the size of the loan exists, and by prearrangement or understanding between the borrower and the licensee a substantial payment is to be made upon the loan with the effect of reducing the bona fide principal amount of the loan to less than the specified amount within a short time after the making of the loan other than by reason of a requirement that the loan be paid in substantially equal periodical installments, then the loan shall not be deemed to be a loan of the bona fide principal amount of the specified amount or more.

(b) A subsequent advance of money of less than a bona fide principal amount of the specified amount pursuant to a revolving or open-end loan agreement or similar agreement between a borrower and a licensed finance lender which gives the borrower the right to draw upon all or any part of the line of credit, or a loan agreement providing for the making of advances to the borrower from time to time up to an aggregate maximum amount which gives the borrower the right to draw all or any part of the total amount, shall be deemed to be a loan of a bona fide principal amount of the specified amount or more if the line of credit or the aggregate maximum amount is a bona fide principal amount of the specified amount or more and the initial advance was a bona fide principal amount of the specified amount or more even though the actual unpaid balance after the advance or at any other time is less than a bona fide principal amount of the specified amount.

(c) If a loan made by a licensed finance lender has a bona fide principal amount of the specified amount or more, the fact that the transaction is in the form of a sale of accounts, chattel paper, goods, or instruments, or a lease of goods, or in the form of an advance on the purchase price of any of the foregoing, shall not be deemed to affect the bona fides of the amount thereof.

(d) For the purposes of this section, “the specified amount” means five thousand dollars ($5,000).

(e) For the purposes of determining whether the loan amount exceeds a regulatory ceiling, the “bona fide principal amount” shall not be comprised of any charges or any other fees or recompense specified in Sections 22500, 22501, and 22601. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to prevent those specified charges, fees, and recompense that have been earned and remain unpaid in an existing loan from being considered as part of the bona fide principal amount of a new loan to refinance that existing loan, provided the new loan is not made for the purpose of circumventing a regulatory ceiling provision. This subdivision is intended to define the meaning of “bona fide principal amount” as used in this division solely for the purposes of determining whether the loan amount exceeds a regulatory ceiling, and is not intended to affect the meaning of “principal” for any other purpose.

######### 22687.  
(a) A program administrator shall determine before executing an assessment contract, and no work shall commence under a home improvement contract that is financed by that assessment contract nor shall that home improvement contract be executed until this determination is made, that the property owner has a reasonable ability to pay the annual payment obligations for the PACE assessment based on the property owner’s income, assets, and current debt obligations.

(A) The program administrator may also utilize the income of a property owner’s legal spouse through marriage, as defined by Division 3 (commencing with Section 300) of the Family Code, or domestic partnership, as defined by Division 2.5 (commencing with Section 297) of the Family Code, who is not on title to the property. Any spouse or domestic partner who is not on title to the property shall consent, in writing, to the inclusion of his or her income and to the verification of his or income as required pursuant to this section.

(B) For any person whose income is considered, the program administrator shall also consider their debt obligations pursuant to this section. The program administrator is not required to consider more income than is necessary, nor to verify assets if verified income is sufficient to determine the ability of the property owner to pay the annual payment obligations.

(4) Debt obligations in accordance with subdivision (c).

(5) In evaluating the income, assets, and current debt obligations of the property owner, the program administrator shall not consider the equity of the property that will secure the assessment contract.

The program administrator may use automated verification provided the source of that verification is specific to the income of the property owner and not based on predictive or estimation methodologies, and has been determined sufficient for those verification purposes by a federal mortgage lending authority or regulator. Examples of records the program administrator may use to verify the property owner’s income or assets include:

(A) A pay stub showing the most recent 30-day pay period or financial institution records showing regular deposits consistent with reported income for the most recent 60 days.

(B) Copies of the most recent tax returns the property owner filed with the Internal Revenue Service or the Franchise Tax Board.

(C) Copies of the most recent Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 (Wage and Tax Statement), or other similar Internal Revenue Service forms that are used for reporting wages or tax withholding.

(A) Temporary sources of income.

(B) Nonliquid assets.

(C) Proceeds derived from the equity from the subject property.

Program administrators shall use at least a two-file Merged Credit Report (MCR) or a Residential Mortgage Credit Report (RMCR). For purposes of this subdivision, monthly debt obligations include, but are not limited to, the following:

(1) All secured and unsecured debt.

(2) Alimony.

(3) Child support.

(4) Monthly housing expenses. If property tax and insurance obligations are not included in a property owner’s escrow, a program administrator shall use reasonably reliable methods to determine these obligations.

(d) In calculating the ability of the property owner to pay the annual payment obligations, the program administrator shall determine that the property owner’s income is sufficient to meet:

(1) The PACE payment, including all interest and fees.

(2) Any mortgage payments, as defined by the higher of the borrower’s self-reported housing payment or housing expenses determined in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (a).

(3) All existing debts and obligations as identified in subdivision (c).

(4) Sufficient residual income to meet basic household living expenses, defined as expected expenses which may be variable based on circumstances and consumption patterns of the household.

Examples of basic living expenses include, but are not limited to, the following:

(A) Food and other necessary household consumables.

(B) Transportation costs to work or school, including fuel costs, auto insurance and maintenance costs, and public transit costs.

(1) The program administrator first attempted to use an automated means of verification as described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b).

(2) If the program administrator was unable to verify the property owner’s income pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), pursuant to Section 5913 of the Streets and Highways Code, the program administrator shall ask the property owner open-ended questions during the oral confirmation of key terms call to identify their income and the sources of their income. The program administrator shall comply with the requirements of subdivision (a), paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), and subdivisions (c) and (d).

(3) The funding is limited to the emergency or immediate necessity improvement and any required improvements directly necessary to the installation and safe operation of the improvement.

(4) Any efficiency improvement funded is eligible for PACE financing.

(5) The property owner executes a waiver of their right to cancel pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 5940 of the Streets and Highways Code, and confirms, pursuant to Section 5913 of the Streets and Highways Code, the emergency or immediate necessity of the improvement.

(6) The amount of the assessment contract does not exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) or a monthly equivalent payment on the PACE assessment of one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125), as adjusted by any annual increase in the California Consumer Price Index as determined pursuant to Section 2212 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, whichever is greater.

(f) The program administrator shall report annually all PACE assessments that were funded and recorded pursuant to subdivision (e) in a form acceptable to the commissioner. The commissioner shall include this information in the annual composite report prepared in accordance with Section 22160.

(g) (1) If there is a difference between the determination of the property owner’s ability to pay the annual PACE obligations and the actual amount financed for the property owner, and the property owner is obligated on the underlying home improvement contract, the program administrator shall be responsible for that difference. This subdivision does not apply in a case of intentional misrepresentation by the property owner. If the program administrator is responsible to pay the difference under this subdivision, the program administrator shall provide to the property owner a written disclosure of the methodology that the program administrator used to determine whether that there was a difference between the property owner’s ability to pay the annual PACE obligation and the actual amount financed for the property owner for purposes of this subdivision.

(b) For the purpose of this section only, no person other than a licensee shall be deemed to be a person subject to this division until the person is determined to be a person subject to this division by an administrative hearing in accordance with Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code or by a judicial hearing in any court of competent jurisdiction.



######### 22707.5.  
(a) If, upon inspection, examination, or investigation, the commissioner has cause to believe that a licensee or other person is violating or has violated any provision of this division or any rule or order thereunder, the commissioner or their designee, may issue a citation to the licensee or person in writing, describing with particularity the basis of the citation. Each citation may contain an order to correct the violation or violations identified and provide a reasonable time period or periods by which the violation or violations must be corrected. In addition, each citation may assess an administrative fine not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) that shall be deposited in the Financial Protection Fund. In assessing a fine, the commissioner shall give due consideration to the appropriateness of the amount of the fine with respect to factors including the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the person or licensees cited, and the history of previous violations. In addition, the commissioner may include a claim for ancillary relief. The ancillary relief may include, but not be limited to, refunds, restitution or disgorgement, or damages on behalf of the persons injured by the act or practice constituting the subject matter of the action. A citation issued or a fine assessed pursuant to this section, while constituting punishment for a violation of law, shall be in lieu of other administrative discipline by the commissioner for the offense or offenses cited.

(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), nothing in this section shall prevent the commissioner from issuing an order to desist and refrain from engaging in a specific business or activity or activities, or an order to suspend all business operations to a person or licensee who is engaged in or who has engaged in continued or repeated violations of this division. In any of these circumstances, the sanctions authorized under this section shall be separate from, and in addition to, all other administrative, civil, or criminal remedies.

(1) The application shall include a certified copy of the final order of the commissioner.

(2) Upon the filing of the application, the superior court shall set a date for a hearing for an order to show cause why judgment should not be entered, which shall be set not less than 60 calendar days from the date the application is filed.

(3) The commissioner shall serve a copy of the application and order along with notice of the hearing to all entities or persons cited in the order against whom a civil judgment is sought not less than 15 calendar days before the date set for the hearing. Service of the application shall be pursuant to the methods specified by Article 3 (commencing with Section 415.10) of Chapter 4 of Title 5 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure for service of summons.

(4) The court shall consider the filing of a certified copy of the final order of the commissioner and the proof of service of the application and notice of the hearing on the persons or entities against whom the judgment is sought, a sufficient prima facie showing to warrant the issuance of the civil judgment at the hearing. The respondent then has the burden of showing by affirmative evidence at the hearing why the order of the commissioner is not final, or why the timely notice of application and hearing was not provided to avoid judgment being entered. Any method of service authorized by laws under which the order was issued is considered valid service for the purposes of determining whether the order is final. Absent this showing by the respondent, the superior court shall issue a final civil judgment compelling compliance with the order.

(5) The judgment issued pursuant to paragraph (4) may be for injunctive relief or payment of ancillary relief or penalties. The judgment may be enforced by the court pursuant to the procedures authorized for any other civil judgment.

(6) This subdivision shall not be construed to limit judicial review of any order of the commissioner in accordance with the law.

In addition, the commissioner may include a claim for ancillary relief.

Upon a proper showing, a permanent or preliminary injunction, restraining order, or writ of mandate shall be granted and other ancillary relief may be granted as appropriate.

(b) If the commissioner determines that it is in the public interest, the commissioner may include in any action authorized by subdivision (a) a claim for ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, a claim for restitution, disgorgement, or damages on behalf of the persons injured by the act or practice constituting the subject matter of the action.

New and material information means information that was not reviewed by the licensee in connection with a prior qualified written request submitted by the same borrower and that is reasonably likely to change the licensee’s prior response related to that request.

(2) A qualified written request is overbroad. A qualified written request is overbroad if the licensee cannot reasonably determine from the qualified written request the specific error that the borrower asserts has occurred on his or her account or the specific information the borrower is requesting related to his or her account. To the extent a licensee can reasonably identify a valid assertion of an error or valid request for information in a qualified written request that is otherwise overbroad, the licensee shall comply with the requirements of subdivision (g) of Section 28130 with respect to that valid asserted error or request for information.

(3) A qualified written request is delivered to the licensee more than one year after the licensee sells, assigns, or transfers the servicing of the student loan that is the subject of the qualified written request to another servicer.

(b) If, pursuant to subdivision (a), a licensee determines that it is not required to comply with the requirements of subdivision (g) of Section 28130, the licensee shall notify the borrower of the determination, and the basis for its determination, in writing not later than five business days after making such determination.



######### 28138.  
Notwithstanding subdivision (b) of Section 28134 and unless prohibited by federal law, a licensee shall retain and maintain its records of servicing a borrower’s student loan for a minimum of three years after the student loan has been sold, assigned, transferred, or paid in full.



######### 28140.  
(a) A licensee shall continuously maintain a minimum net worth of at least two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).

(b) Subject to the commissioner’s sole discretion, an applicant or licensee that is a wholly owned subsidiary of a public holding company required to comply with the reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission may satisfy the requirement of subdivision (a) by submitting the annual consolidated audited financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including consolidating financial statements of the subsidiary, which evidence to the commissioner’s satisfaction that the subsidiary meets the continuous minimum net worth requirements of at least two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).



######### 28142.  
(a) A licensee shall maintain a surety bond in accordance with this section in a minimum amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000). The bond shall be payable to the commissioner and issued by an insurer authorized to do business in this state. The surety bond, including any and all riders and endorsements executed subsequent to the effective date of the bond, shall be filed with the commissioner within 10 days of execution. For licensees with multiple licensed locations, only one surety bond is required. The bond shall be used for the recovery of expenses, fines, and fees levied by the commissioner in accordance with this division or for losses or damages incurred by borrowers as the result of a licensee’s noncompliance with the requirements of this division. The commissioner may require licensees to submit bonds, riders, and endorsements electronically through the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System & Registry’s electronic surety bond function.

(b) When an action is commenced on a licensee’s bond, the commissioner may require the filing of a new bond. Immediately upon recovery of any action on the bond, the licensee shall file a new bond. Failure to file a new bond within 10 days of the recovery on a bond, or within 10 days after notification by the commissioner that a new bond is required, constitutes sufficient grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license.

(c) The commissioner may require a higher bond amount for a licensee based on the dollar amount of servicing of student loans by that licensee.



######### 28144.  
(a) Each licensee shall pay to the commissioner its pro rata share of all costs and expenses reasonably incurred in the administration of this division, as estimated by the commissioner, for the ensuing year and any deficit actually incurred or anticipated in the administration of the division in the year in which the assessment is made. The pro rata share shall be the proportion that a licensee’s servicing activities in this state bears to the costs and expenses remaining after the amount assessed pursuant to subdivision (c).

(b) On or before the 30th day of September in each year, the commissioner shall notify each licensee of the amount assessed and levied against it and that amount shall be paid by October 31. If payment is not made by October 31, the commissioner shall assess and collect a penalty, in addition to the assessment, of 1 percent of the assessment for each month or part of a month that the payment is delayed or withheld.

(c) In the levying and collection of the assessment, a licensee shall neither be assessed for nor be permitted to pay less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250) per licensed location per year.

(d) If a licensee fails to pay the assessment on or before the 31st day of October, the commissioner may by order summarily suspend or revoke the license issued to the licensee. If, after an order is made, a request for hearing is filed in writing within 30 days, and a hearing is not held within 60 days thereafter, the order is deemed rescinded as of its effective date. During any period when the license is revoked or suspended, a licensee shall not engage in the business of servicing student loans in this state pursuant to this division except as may be permitted by order of the commissioner. However, the revocation, suspension, or surrender of a license shall not affect the powers of the commissioner as provided in this division.

(e) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) to (d), inclusive, the commissioner may by rule require licensees to pay assessments through the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System & Registry.



######### 28146.  
(a) A licensee shall file an annual report with the commissioner, on or before the 15th day of March, giving the relevant information that the commissioner reasonably requires concerning the business and operations conducted by the licensee in the state during the preceding calendar year, including information regarding the number of loans that are sold, assigned, or transferred to another party. The individual annual reports filed pursuant to this section shall be made available to the public for inspection. The report shall be made under oath and in the form prescribed by the commissioner.

(b) A licensee shall make other special reports that may be required by the commissioner.



######### 28148.  
(a) At the end of the licensee’s fiscal year, but in no case more than 12 months after the last audit conducted pursuant to this section, each licensee shall cause its books and accounts to be audited by an independent certified public accountant. The audit shall be sufficiently comprehensive in scope to permit the expression of an opinion on the financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and shall be performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The audit shall include a reconciliation of the licensee’s trust accounts as of the audit date.

(b) “Expression of an opinion” includes (1) an unqualified opinion, (2) a qualified opinion, (3) a disclaimer of opinion, or (4) an adverse opinion. If a financial statement, report, certificate, or opinion of the independent certified public accountant is in any way qualified, the commissioner may require the licensee to take any action that the commissioner deems appropriate to address the qualification. The commissioner may reject any financial statement, report, certificate, or opinion by notifying the licensee or other person required to make the filing of the rejection and the reason therefor. Within 30 days after the receipt of the notice, the licensee or other person shall correct the deficiencies. Failure to correct the deficiencies is a violation of this division. The commissioner shall retain a copy of all financial statements, reports, certificates, or opinions so rejected.

(c) If a qualified or adverse opinion is expressed or if an opinion is disclaimed, the reasons therefor shall be fully explained.

(d) The audit report shall be filed with the commissioner within 105 days of the end of the licensee’s fiscal year. The report filed with the commissioner shall be certified by the certified public accountant conducting the audit.

(e) If a licensee required to make an audit fails to cause an audit to be made, the commissioner may cause the audit to be made by an independent certified public accountant at the licensee’s expense. The commissioner shall select the independent certified public accountant by advertising for bids or by other fair and impartial means. The commissioner may summarily revoke the license of a licensee who fails to file a certified financial statement prepared by an independent certified public accountant as required by this division or at the request of the commissioner.



######### 28150.  
A licensee that ceases to service student loans to borrowers shall inform the commissioner in writing and surrender the license and all other indicia of license to the commissioner. The commissioner may require a licensee to file a plan for the disposition of the servicing business that includes, but is not limited to, a closing audit. Upon receipt of the written notice and plan, if required, the commissioner shall determine whether the licensee has violated this division. The commissioner shall give a licensee notice of accepting a surrendered license, and a license shall not be deemed surrendered until the commissioner accepts its tender in writing.







##### CHAPTER 4. Administration and Power of the Commissioner [28152 - 28153.5]  

######### 28152.  
(a) As often as the commissioner deems necessary and appropriate, but at least once every 36 months, the commissioner shall examine the affairs of each licensee for compliance with this division. The commissioner shall appoint suitable persons to perform the examination. The commissioner and his or her appointees may examine the books, records, and documents of the licensee, and may examine the licensee’s officers, directors, employees, or agents under oath regarding the licensee’s operations. The commissioner may cooperate with any agency of the state, the federal government, or other states.

(b) Unless otherwise exempt pursuant to Section 28102, affiliates of a licensee are subject to examination by the commissioner on the same terms as the licensee, but only when reports from, or examination of, a licensee provides documented evidence of unlawful activity between a licensee and affiliate benefitting, affecting, or arising from the activities regulated by this division.

(c) The cost of each examination of a licensee shall be paid to the commissioner by the licensee examined, and the commissioner may maintain an action for the recovery of the cost in any court of competent jurisdiction. In determining the cost of the examination, the commissioner may use the estimated average hourly cost for all persons performing examinations of licensees or other persons subject to this division for the fiscal year.

(d) The statement of the findings of an examination shall belong to the commissioner and shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the licensee, law enforcement officials, or other state or federal regulatory agencies for further investigation and enforcement. Reports required of licensees by the commissioner under this division and results of examinations performed by the commissioner under this division are the property of the commissioner.

(e) The commissioner shall provide a written statement of the findings of the examination, issue a copy of that statement to the licensee and take appropriate steps to ensure correction of any violations of this division.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this division, the commissioner shall have the authority to waive one or more branch office examinations, if the commissioner deems that the branch office examinations are not necessary for the protection of the public, due to the centralized operations of the licensee or other factors acceptable to the commissioner.



######### 28153.  
The commissioner may require persons who are not expressly excluded from this division under subdivision (b) of Section 28102 to file with the commissioner, under oath or otherwise, in the form and within a reasonable period of time as prescribed by the commissioner by special reports, or answers in writing to specific questions or requests for information.

######### 28154.  
(a) If a licensee fails to do either of the following, the commissioner shall impose a penalty in a sum of up to one hundred dollars ($100) for every day late:

(2) That the person has been convicted of or pleaded nolo contendere to any crime, or has been held liable in any civil action by final judgment, or any administrative judgment by any public agency, if that crime or civil or administrative judgment involved any offense specified in subdivision (b) of Section 50317, or any other offense reasonably related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of a person engaged in the business in accordance with the provisions of this division.

(b) Within 15 days from the date of a notice of intention to issue an order pursuant to subdivision (a), the person may request a hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code). Upon receipt of a request, the matter shall be set for hearing to commence within 30 days after such receipt unless the person subject to this division consents to a later date. If no hearing is requested within 15 days after the mailing or service of such notice and none is ordered by the commissioner, the failure to request a hearing shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing.

(c) Upon receipt of a notice of intention to issue an order pursuant to this section, the person who is the subject of the proposed order is immediately prohibited from engaging in any servicing.

(d) Persons suspended or barred under this section are prohibited from participating in any business activity of a licensee and from engaging in any business activity on the premises where a licensee is servicing.

The order shall be effective immediately, but shall not become final except in accordance with the provisions of Section 28164.

This section does not apply to persons exempted under subdivision (b) of Section 28102.

If, after investigation, the commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that a licensee is failing to comply with this division or any regulation or order of the commissioner, the commissioner shall, by written order addressed to the licensee, direct the discontinuance of the failure to comply.

The licensee may consent to have the hearing commence at a later date. If no hearing is requested within 30 days after the mailing or service of the required notice, and none is ordered by the commissioner, the order may become final without hearing and the licensee shall immediately discontinue the practices named in the order. If a hearing is requested or ordered, it shall be held in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), and the commissioner shall have all of the powers granted under that act.

(f) The licensee is insolvent, suspends payment of its obligations, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors.

######### 30602.  
If any licensed securities depository fails to make any report required by law or by the commissioner within 10 days from the day designated for the making of the report, or within any extension of time granted by the commissioner, or has failed to pay any fee or charge payable under this division within 10 days after notice by the commissioner that such fee is due and unpaid, such failure shall constitute grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license held by such securities depository or for the issuance of an order by the commissioner under the provisions of Section 30215.



######### 30603.  
If it appears to the commissioner that any licensed securities depository located within this state is conducting business in an unsafe or injurious manner, he shall, by written order addressed to the securities depository direct the discontinuance of such unsafe or injurious practices, or if the licensed securities depository is one which is located outside this state but is soliciting holders of securities in California to place their securities in such securities depository, the commissioner shall direct such securities depository to discontinue all such solicitations until all such unsafe and unsound practices have been corrected.



######### 30604.  
An order issued pursuant to Section 30601 or 30603 shall require the licensed securities depository to show cause before the commissioner, at a time fixed by the commissioner, why the order should not be observed. If upon the hearing, it appears to the commissioner that the licensed securities depository is conducting business in an unsafe or injurious manner or is violating its articles of incorporation or any law of this state, or any rule binding upon it, the commissioner shall make the order of discontinuance final and the licensed securities depository shall immediately discontinue the practices named in the order.



######### 30605.  
The licensed securities depository has 10 days after an order is made final in which to commence action to restrain enforcement of such order, and unless such action is commenced, and the enforcement of such order is enjoined within 10 days by the court in which the suit is brought, the licensed securities depository shall comply with the order.



######### 30606.  
(a) If a securities depository fails to comply with a final order and has not secured a court order restraining the enforcement of the final order, the commissioner may revoke the license of the securities depository or may institute proceedings under subdivision (b) to enforce the final order.

(b) Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any person has engaged or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of this law or any rule or order under this law, the commissioner may in the commissioner’s discretion bring an action in the superior court to enjoin the acts or practices or to enforce compliance with this law or any rule or order under this law. Upon a proper showing, a permanent or preliminary injunction, restraining order, or writ of mandate shall be granted and a receiver or conservator may be appointed for the defendant or the defendant’s assets.

The commissioner may commence and prosecute actions and proceedings to enjoin violations of this division or violations of orders or decisions of the commissioner rendered pursuant to this division, and for the enforcement of any and all civil penalties provided for by this division.

(a) The licensee has violated any provision of this division or any rule or order made by the commissioner under and within the authority of this division.

(b) Any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for such license, reasonably would have warranted the commissioner in refusing originally to issue such license.



######### 30609.  
(a) The commissioner may, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, by order, censure or suspend for a period not exceeding 12 months, or bar from any position of employment, management, or control any person who operates a securities depository, or any other person, if the commissioner finds either of the following:

(1) That the censure, suspension, or bar is in the public interest and that the person has committed or caused a violation of this division or rule or order of the commissioner, which violation was either known or should have been known by the person committing or causing it or has caused material damage to the securities depository, or to the public.

(2) That the person has been convicted of or pleaded nolo contendere to any crime, or has been held liable in any civil action by final judgment, or any administrative judgment by any public agency, if that crime or civil or administrative judgment involved any offense involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit, or any other offense reasonably related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of a person engaged in the business in accordance with the provisions of this division.

(b) Within 15 days from the date of a notice of intention to issue an order pursuant to subdivision (a), the person may request a hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 11400) of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code). Upon receipt of a request, the matter shall be set for hearing to commence within 30 days after such receipt unless the person subject to this division consents to a later date. If no hearing is requested within 15 days after the mailing or service of such notice and none is ordered by the commissioner, the failure to request a hearing shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing.

(c) Upon receipt of a notice of intention to issue an order pursuant to this section, the person who is the subject of the proposed order is immediately prohibited from engaging in any activities subject to licensure under the law.

(d) Persons suspended or barred under this section are prohibited from participating in any business activity of a securities depository and from engaging in any business activity on the premises where a securities depository is conducting business.

##### CHAPTER 1. Findings and Purpose  [90000- 90000.]  

######### 90000.  
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: 

(1) California consumers are vulnerable to abuse if the state lacks a dedicated financial services regulator with broad authority over providers of financial products and services. The lack of such a regulator has left consumers vulnerable to abuse and forced California businesses to compete with unscrupulous providers. The financial victimization of economically vulnerable consumers, including individuals who lack a safety net, not only harms the individual but also has a broader social and economic cost on all of California, and could lead to increased caseloads for social safety net programs. These problems become even more acute in times of crisis, including the global Covid-19 pandemic and economic fallout. Consequently, where feasible, the Legislature should enact statutory measures to protect California residents from financial abuses in the marketplace for financial products and services.

(2) Robust consumer protections enable wealth building and promote a vibrant economy. They are especially important among various populations, including, but not limited to, military service members, seniors, students, and new Californians. Unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices in the provision of financial products and services undermine the public confidence that is essential to the continued functioning of the financial system and sound extensions of credit to consumers.

(3) Technological innovation offers great promise to the more effective and efficient provision of consumer financial products and services to the population of California and also poses risks to consumers and challenges to law enforcement in addressing those risks.

(4) It is the intent of the Legislature to enact the California Consumer Financial Protection Law to strengthen consumer protections by expanding the ability of the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation to improve accountability and transparency in the California financial system, provide consumer financial education, and protect consumers from abusive financial practices, while prioritizing the prevention of unethical businesses from harming the most vulnerable populations including military service members, seniors, students, low- and moderate-income individuals, and new Californians.

(b) The purpose of the California Consumer Financial Protection Law shall be to promote consumer welfare, fair competition, and wealth creation in this state by doing all of the following:

(1) Promoting nondiscriminatory access to responsible, affordable credit on terms that reasonably reflect consumers’ ability to repay.

(2) Promoting nondiscriminatory access to consumer financial products and services that are understandable and not unfair, deceptive, or abusive.

(3) Protecting consumers from discrimination and unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices in connection with financial practices and services.

(4) Promoting nondiscriminatory consumer-protective innovation in consumer financial products and services.







##### CHAPTER 2. Short Title  [90001- 90001.]

(c) In the levying and collection of the annual fees, a licensee shall neither be charged for nor be permitted to pay less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250) nor more than an aggregate of all reasonable costs to operate this division, with the exception of fees associated with investigations and examinations.

(d) If a licensee fails to pay the annual fees on or before January 1, the commissioner may by order summarily suspend or revoke the license issued to the licensee. If, after an order is made, a request for hearing is filed in writing within 30 days, and a hearing is not held within 60 days thereafter, the order is deemed rescinded as of its effective date. During any period when the license is revoked or suspended, a licensee shall not engage in the business of collecting debt in this state pursuant to this division except as may be permitted by order of the commissioner. However, the revocation, suspension, or surrender of a license shall not affect the powers of the commissioner as provided in this division.

(e) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) to (d), inclusive, the commissioner may by rule require licensees to pay annual fees through the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System & Registry. 



######### 100021.

(d) Unless otherwise exempt pursuant to Section 100001, affiliates of a licensee are subject to examination by the commissioner on the same terms as the licensee, but only when reports from, or examination of, a licensee provides documented evidence of unlawful activity between a licensee and affiliate benefitting, affecting, or arising from the activities regulated by this division.

(e) The cost of each examination of a licensee shall be paid to the commissioner by the licensee examined, and the commissioner may maintain an action for the recovery of the cost in any court of competent jurisdiction. In determining the cost of the examination, the commissioner may use the estimated average hourly cost for all persons performing examinations of licensees or other persons subject to this division for the fiscal year.

(f) The statement of the findings of an examination shall belong to the commissioner and shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the licensee, law enforcement officials, or other state or federal regulatory agencies for further investigation and enforcement. Reports required of licensees by the commissioner under this division and results of examinations performed by the commissioner under this division are the property of the commissioner.

(g) The commissioner shall provide a written statement of the findings of the examination, issue a copy of that statement to the licensee and take appropriate steps to ensure correction of any violations of this division.

(h) Notwithstanding any provision of this division, the commissioner shall have the authority to waive one or more branch office examinations, if the commissioner deems that the branch office examinations are not necessary for the protection of the public, due to the centralized operations of the licensee or other factors acceptable to the commissioner.
