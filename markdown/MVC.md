(a) In any action or proceeding commenced in any court, if there shall be a default of any appearance by the defendant, the plaintiff, before entering judgment shall file in the court a declaration under penalty of perjury setting forth facts showing that the defendant is not in the military service. If unable to file that declaration, the plaintiff shall, in lieu thereof, file a declaration setting forth either that the defendant is in the service or that the plaintiff is not able to determine whether or not the defendant is in the service. If a declaration is not filed showing that the defendant is not in the military service, no judgment shall be entered without first securing an order of court directing that entry, and no order shall be made if the defendant is in the military service until after the court appoints an attorney to represent the defendant and protect his or her interest, and the court shall, on application, make that appointment. If an attorney appointed under this section to represent a service member cannot locate the service member, actions by the attorney in the case shall not waive any defense of the service member or otherwise bind the service member. Unless it appears that the defendant is not in the military service the court may require, as a condition before judgment is entered, that the plaintiff file a bond approved by the court conditioned to indemnify the defendant, if in the military service, against any loss or damage that he or she may suffer by reason of any judgment should the judgment be thereafter set aside in whole or in part. The court may make such other and further order or enter that judgment as in its opinion may be necessary to protect the rights of the defendant under this section.

(b) Any person who shall, for purposes of this section, make or use a declaration declared to be true under penalty of perjury, knowing it to be false, is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable by imprisonment not to exceed one year or by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both. Any person violating any provision of this section is also liable for actual damages, reasonable attorney’s fees, and costs incurred by the injured party.

(c) In an action covered by this section in which the defendant is in military service, the court shall grant a stay of proceedings for a minimum period of 90 days under this subdivision upon application of counsel, or on the court’s own motion, if the court determines that there may be a defense to the action and a defense cannot be presented without the presence of the defendant, or, after due diligence, counsel has been unable to contact the defendant or otherwise determine if a meritorious defense exists.

(d) In any action or proceeding in which a service member is a party, if the service member does not personally appear therein or is not represented by an authorized attorney, the court may appoint an attorney to represent him or her. In that case a bond may be required and an order made to protect the rights of the service member. However, no attorney appointed under this chapter to protect a service member shall have the power to waive any right of the person for whom he or she is appointed or bind him or her by his or her acts.

(e) If any judgment shall be rendered in any action or proceeding governed by this chapter against any service member during the period of that service or within 30 days thereafter, and it appears that the service member was prejudiced by reason of his or her military service in making his or her defense thereto, the judgment may, upon application made by the service member or his or her legal representative not later than 90 days after the termination of the service, be opened by the court rendering the same and the defendant or his or her legal representative let in to defend; provided the application states a meritorious or legal defense to the action or some part thereof. Vacating, setting aside, or reversing any judgment by reason of this chapter shall not impair any right or title acquired by any bona fide purchaser for value under that judgment.

(f) For purposes of this section and any declaration made under this section, a defendant shall be deemed to be “in the military service” if he or she is either:

(1) Currently in the military service.

(2) Was in the military service within the preceding 120 days.



######### 403.  
(a) At any stage in any action or proceeding in which a service member is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, during a period of military service or within 120 days thereafter, the court may, in its discretion on its own motion, and shall, on application to it by the service member or some person on his or her behalf, stay the action or proceeding unless, in the opinion of the court, the ability of the plaintiff to prosecute the action or the defendant to conduct his or her defense is not materially affected by reason of his or her military service.

(b) When an action for compliance with the terms of any contract is stayed pursuant to this section, no fine or penalty shall accrue by reason of failure to comply with the terms of the contract during the period of the stay, and in any case where a person fails to perform any obligation and if a fine or penalty for the nonperformance is incurred a court may, on those terms as may be just, provide relief against the enforcement of that fine or penalty if it appears that the person who would suffer by that fine or penalty was in the military service when the penalty was incurred and that by reason of military service the ability of the person to pay or perform was thereby materially impaired.

(c) In any action or proceeding against a service member, before or during the period of the service, or within 120 days thereafter, the court may, in its discretion on its own motion, or shall, upon application to it by the service member or some person on his or her behalf, unless in the opinion of the court the ability of the defendant to comply with the judgment or order entered or sought is not materially affected by reason of his or her military service, do either of the following:

(1) Stay the execution of any judgment or order entered against a service member.

(2) Vacate or stay any attachment or garnishment of property, money, or debts in the hands of another, whether before or after judgment.

(d) Any stay of any action, proceeding, attachment, or execution ordered by any court under this section may, except as otherwise provided, be ordered for the period of military service and three months thereafter or any part of that period, and subject to those terms as may be just, including terms with respect to payment in installments of those amounts at those times as the court may fix. If the service member is a codefendant with others the plaintiff may nevertheless, by leave of court, proceed against the others.

(e) A service member who is granted a stay of a civil action or proceeding under this section may apply for an additional stay based on continuing material effect of military duty on the service member’s ability to appear. If the court refuses to grant an additional stay of proceedings, it shall appoint counsel to represent the service member in the action or proceeding.

(f) An application for a stay under this section does not constitute an appearance for jurisdictional purposes and does not constitute a waiver of any substantive or procedural defense, including a defense relating to lack of personal jurisdiction.



######### 404.  
(a) A period of military service shall not be included in computing any period now or hereafter to be limited by any law, regulation, or order for the bringing of any action or proceeding in any court, board, bureau, commission, department, or other agency of government by or against any service member or by or against his or her heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns, whether the cause of action or the right or privilege to institute the action or proceeding accrued prior to or during the period of service, nor shall any part of the period be included in computing any period now or hereafter provided by any law for the redemption of real property sold or forfeited to enforce any obligation, tax, or assessment.

(b) This section shall not apply with respect to any period of limitation prescribed by or under the federal Internal Revenue Code.



######### 405.

(1) For an obligation or liability consisting of a mortgage, trust deed, or other security in the nature of a mortgage, or any student loan, during any part of the period of military service and one year thereafter.

(2) For any other obligation or liability, during any part of the period of military service and 120 days thereafter.

(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), if in the opinion of a court, upon application thereto by the obligee, the ability of the service member to pay interest upon an obligation or liability at a rate in excess of 6 percent per year is not materially affected by reason of that service, the court may make that order as in its opinion may be just.

(c) As used in this section, “interest” includes service charges, renewal charges, fees, or any other charges, except bona fide insurance, in respect of any obligation or liability.

(d) Interest at a rate in excess of 6 percent per year that would otherwise be incurred but for the prohibition in this section is forgiven. The amount of any periodic payment due from a service member shall be reduced by the amount of the interest forgiven under this section that is allocable to the period for which the payment is made.

(e) Any person violating this section shall be liable for actual damages, reasonable attorney’s fees, and costs incurred by the injured party.



######### 406.  
(a) No eviction or distress shall be made during the period of military service specified in Section 400, until 120 days after the service member is released from active service or duty if the premises are occupied primarily for dwelling purposes by the spouse, children, or other dependents of a service member, except upon leave of court granted upon application therefor or granted in an action or proceeding affecting the right of possession.

(b) On any application or in any action under this section, the court may on its own motion, and shall, on application, stay the proceedings for the period specified in subdivision (a) or rather than granting a complete stay, the court may require the tenant to make regular partial payments during the service member’s period of military service, or the court may make any other order that it finds to be just, unless the court finds that the ability of the tenant to pay the agreed rent is not materially affected by that military service. Where that stay is made by the court, the owner of the premises shall be entitled, upon application therefor, to relief in respect of those premises similar to that granted persons in military service in Sections 407, 408, and 409.1 to that extent and for that period as may appear to the court to be just.

(c) Any person violating this section shall be liable for actual damages, reasonable attorney’s fees, and costs incurred by the injured party.

(d) Any person who knowingly takes part in any eviction or distress as provided in this section or who attempts to do so, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punishable by imprisonment not to exceed one year or by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both.

(b) Upon the hearing of that action as provided in subdivision (a), the court may order the repayment of prior installments or deposits or any part, as a condition of terminating the contract and resuming possession of the property, or may, in its discretion, on its own motion, and shall, on application to it by the service member or some person on the service member’s behalf, order a stay of proceedings as the court deems just, unless in the opinion of the court, the ability of the defendant to comply with the terms of the contract is not materially affected by reason of the service; or it may make any other disposition of the case as may be equitable to conserve the interests of all parties.

(c) Any person violating this section shall be liable for actual damages, reasonable attorney’s fees, and costs incurred by the injured party.

(d) Any person who shall knowingly resume possession of property that is the subject of this section in a manner other than as provided in subdivision (a), or attempts to do so, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punishable by imprisonment not to exceed one year or by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both.

(b) A security interest in personal property other than a motor vehicle, off-highway vehicle, trailer, vessel, or aircraft is void, and cannot be perfected, if it would cause a loan procured by a covered member in the course of purchasing the personal property to be exempt from the requirements of Section 987 of Title 10 of the United States Code.

(c) A security interest in a motor vehicle is void, and cannot be perfected, if it would cause a loan procured by a covered member in the course of purchasing the motor vehicle to be exempt from Section 987 of Title 10 of the United States Code, and the loan also funds the purchase of a credit insurance product or credit-related ancillary product.

(4) To be considered as a potential priority buyer of the armory, a local agency shall notify the Department of General Services of its interest in the armory within 90 days of the Department of General Services posting on its Internet Web site the notice of the availability of the armory property. When more than one local agency expresses an interest in the armory, the Department of General Services shall transfer the armory to the local agency offering the highest amount of money above fair market value.

(5) If no local agency is interested, or an agreement, as provided above, is not reached, then the disposal of the armory to private entities or individuals shall be pursuant to a public bidding process designed to obtain the highest most certain return for the state from a responsible bidder, and any transaction based on that bidding process shall be deemed to be the fair market value.

(c) As to an armory sold pursuant to this section, the Director of General Services shall except and reserve to the state all mineral deposits, as described in Section 6407 of the Public Resources Code, together with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the deposits. If, however, the Director of General Services determines that there is little or no potential for mineral deposits, the reservation may be without surface right of entry above a depth of 500 feet, or the rights to prospect for, mine, and remove the deposits shall be limited to those areas of the armory conveyed that the director determines to be reasonably necessary for the removal of the deposits.

##### CHAPTER 9. Military Courts [450 - 475]  

######### 450.  
The military courts of this state are: (a) general courts-martial; (b) special courts-martial; (c) summary courts-martial; (d) courts of inquiry; and (e) Courts-Martial Appellate Panel.



######### 450.1.  
(a) Under regulations as the Governor may prescribe, and under any additional regulations as may be prescribed by the Adjutant General, limitations may be placed on the powers granted by this section with respect to the kind and amount of punishment authorized, the categories of commanding officers and warrant officers exercising command authorized to exercise those powers, the applicability of this section to an accused who demands trial by court-martial, and the kinds of courts-martial to which the case may be referred upon that demand. Except in the case of the imposition of fines upon officers and warrant officers, punishment may not be imposed upon any member of the California National Guard under this section if the member has, before the imposition of punishment, demanded trial by court-martial in lieu of punishment. Under similar regulations, rules may be prescribed with respect to the suspension of punishments authorized hereunder. If authorized by regulations of the Adjutant General, a commanding officer who under the Uniform Code of Military Justice would exercise general court-martial jurisdiction or an officer of general rank in command may delegate his or her powers under this section to a principal assistant.

(b) Subject to subdivision (a), any commanding officer may, in addition to or in lieu of admonition or reprimand, impose one or more of the following disciplinary punishments for minor offenses without the intervention of a court-martial:

(1) Upon officers of his or her command:

(A) Restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than 30 consecutive days.

(B) If imposed by an officer who under the Uniform Code of Military Justice would exercise general court-martial jurisdiction or an officer of general rank in command:

(i) Arrest in quarters for not more than 30 consecutive days.

(ii) Impose a fine of not more than 15 days pay per month for two months.

(iii) Restriction to certain specified limits with or without suspension from duty for not more than 60 consecutive days.

(iv) Detention of not more than 15 days’ pay per month for three months.

(2) Upon other personnel of his or her command:

(A) Correctional custody for not more than seven consecutive days.

(B) Impose a fine of not more than seven days’ pay.

(C) Reduction to the next inferior pay grade, if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction.

(D) Extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than 14 consecutive days.

(E) Restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than 14 consecutive days.

(F) Detention of not more than 14 days’ pay.

(G) If imposed by an officer of the grade of major or above:

(i) Correctional custody for not more than 30 consecutive days.

(ii) Impose a fine of not more than 15 days’ pay per month for two months.

(iii) Reduction to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade, if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction, but an enlisted member in a pay grade above E-4 may not be reduced more than two pay grades.

(iv) Extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than 45 consecutive days.

(v) Restrictions to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than 60 consecutive days.

(vi) Detention of not more than 15 days’ pay per month for three months.

The punishments heretofore prescribed by subdivision (b) (1) A, B(i) and (iii) and subdivision (b) (2) A, D, E, G(i), (iv) and (v) hereof may be imposed only during annual active duty for training or active state service, except that extra duties may be imposed upon enlisted persons while in armory drill status for two hours (to be completed not later than 2400 hours) for two consecutive drills.

Detention of pay shall be for a stated period of not more than one year but if the offender’s term of service expires earlier, the detention shall terminate upon that expiration. No two or more of the punishments of arrest in quarters, correctional custody, extra duties, and restriction may be combined to run consecutively in the maximum amount imposable for each. Whenever any of those punishments are combined to run consecutively, there shall be an apportionment. In addition, forfeiture of pay may not be combined with detention of pay without an apportionment. For the purposes of this subdivision, “correctional custody” means the physical restraint of a person during duty or nonduty hours and may include extra duties, fatigue duties, or hard labor. If practicable, correctional custody shall not be served in immediate association with persons awaiting trial or held in confinement pursuant to trial by court-martial.

(c) An officer in charge may impose upon enlisted members assigned to the unit of which he or she is in charge any of the punishments authorized under subdivision (b)(2)(A) to (G), inclusive, as the Adjutant General may specifically prescribe by regulation.

(d) The officer who imposes the punishment authorized in subdivision (b), or his or her successor in command, may, at any time, suspend probationally any part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may suspend probationally a reduction in grade or a fine imposed under subdivision (b), whether or not executed. In addition, the officer may, at any time, remit or mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may set aside in whole or in part the punishment, whether executed or unexecuted, and restore all rights, privileges, and property affected. The officer may also mitigate reduction in grade to a fine or detention of pay. When mitigating:

(1) arrest in quarters to restriction;

(2) correctional custody to extra duties or restriction, or both; or

(3) extra duties to restriction;

the mitigated punishment shall not be for a greater period than the punishment mitigated. When mitigating a fine to detention of pay, the amount of the detention shall not be greater than the amount of the fine. When mitigating reduction in grade to a fine or detention of pay, the amount of the fine or detention shall not be greater than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this article by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.

(e) A person punished under this section who considers his or her punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through the proper channel, appeal to the next superior authority. The appeal shall be promptly forwarded and decided, but the person punished may in the meantime be required to undergo the punishment adjudged. The superior authority may exercise the same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be exercised under subdivision (d) by the officer who imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a punishment of:

(1) arrest in quarters for more than seven days;

(2) correctional custody for more than seven days;

(3) a fine of more than seven days’ pay;

(4) reduction of one or more pay grades from the fourth or a higher pay grade;

(5) extra duties for more than 14 days;

(6) restriction for more than 14 days; or

(7) detention of more than 14 days’ pay;

the authority who is to act on the appeal shall refer the case to a judge advocate of the California National Guard for consideration and advice, and may so refer the case upon appeal from any punishment imposed under subdivision (b).

(f) The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment under this section for any act or omission is not a bar to trial by court-martial for a serious crime or offense growing out of the same act or omission, and not properly punishable under this section; but the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be shown by the accused upon trial, and when so shown shall be considered in determining the measure of punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding of guilty.

(g) The Adjutant General may, by regulation, prescribe the form of records to be kept of proceedings under this article and may also prescribe that certain categories of those proceedings shall be in writing.



######### 451.  
(a) The constitution and jurisdiction of general courts-martial, special courts-martial, summary courts-martial, and courts of inquiry, the form and manner in which the proceedings are conducted and recorded, the forms of oaths and affirmations taken in the administration of military law by such courts, the limits of punishment, and the proceedings in the revision thereof, shall be governed by the terms of the laws and regulations governing the United States Army, Air Force, or Navy, and the law and procedure of similar courts of the United States Army, Air Force, or Navy, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

(b) The provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and the rules and regulations published thereunder, shall govern and be applicable to the active militia, including the California National Guard, except as otherwise provided in this code, the California Manual for Courts-Martial, or other regulations as adopted by the Governor or Adjutant General.

(c) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), an attempt by a member of the active militia, including the California National Guard, to kill himself or herself shall not be prosecuted as a military crime.

(2) The Adjutant General shall ensure that any member of the active militia that attempts to kill himself or herself shall be referred, as soon as practically possible, to the department’s Behavioral Health Liaison Program, or its successor, to receive assistance, counseling, or referral to other appropriate available services.



######### 452.  
General courts-martial may be convened by the President of the United States or the Governor or the Adjutant General.

Such courts-martial may also be appointed by superior authority when by the latter deemed desirable. When any such commanding officer is the accuser or the prosecutor of the person or persons to be tried, the court shall be appointed by superior authority. Special courts-martial may be composed of either one officer who shall be a field grade officer of the rank of major, lieutenant colonel or colonel or three or more members as provided for in the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the rules and regulations published thereunder. After final action by the reviewing authority the record of the trial by special courts-martial shall be filed in the office of the Adjutant General.



######### 454.  
Summary courts-martial may be appointed by the commanding officer of a garrison, fort, post, camp, or other place where troops are on duty, regiment, detached battalion, detached company, or other detachment; but those summary courts-martial may in any case be appointed by superior authority when by the latter deemed desirable: Except when only one officer is present with a command, he or she shall be the summary courts-martial of that command and shall hear and determine cases brought before him or her. After final action by the reviewing authority an authenticated copy of the completed charge sheet shall be filed in the office of the Adjutant General.



######### 455.  
Courts of inquiry shall consist of at least three members and may be ordered by the Governor to examine into the nature of any transaction of or accusation or imputation against any officer or enlisted person.

The members of the court may be officers or qualified enlisted persons, and the court may include both officers and qualified enlisted persons.

(c) The department shall waive the occupancy requirement in any case where the State Department of Health determines that health hazards on adjacent property render the farm, home, or mobilehome unsuitable for occupancy, and the waiver shall be effective as long as those conditions exist.



######### 987.63.  
Notwithstanding other provisions of this article relating to the occupancy, leasing, letting, or subletting of a farm or home acquired pursuant to this article, the department, with respect to any veteran who after consummating a purchase of a farm or home under this article and occupying such farms or home reenters the active military, naval, or air service of the United State, may waive the occupancy requirement for the period of such active service and for a reasonable period subsequent to the termination of such active service and consent to the leasing, letting, or subletting of the farm or home during such period or periods.

In the event of any conflict or difference between any provision of this article and the federal Mortgage Subsidy Bond Tax Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-499; 94 Stat. 2660), including any amendment thereto and any regulation issued thereunder, the department shall comply with that federal law or regulation to the extent necessary to maintain the tax-exempt status of any issue of its general obligation or revenue bonds. Any action taken by the department prior to the effective date of this section to effect that compliance is hereby confirmed and ratified, it having at all times been the intent of the Legislature that the tax-exempt status of those bonds be maintained.

(c) A veteran purchasing the home may advance, subject to Section 987.64, the difference between the total price or cost of the home and the sum of the purchase price of the home and any amount the department adds, under Section 987.69, to the purchase price of the home in fixing the selling price to the veteran. Any amount of the purchase price may be provided by funds from participation contracts, revenue bonds, or other traditional funding options, including mortgage backed securities.

######### 987.655.  
For a mobilehome which is to be sited in a mobilehome park as defined in Section 18214 of the Health and Safety Code, the department shall charge a rate of interest higher than that which is charged to purchasers of conventional housing or of a mobilehome sited on a lot owned by the purchaser.

######### 987.656.  
A mobilehome which is purchased under this act shall not be moved from its original site to any other location, without first obtaining prior authorization from the department.

Any person who moves or causes to be moved a mobilehome under this act, without first obtaining approval from the department, shall be jointly and severally liable to the department for the full amount of the mobilehome loan balance.



######### 987.67.  
Except as set forth in regulations adopted by the department pursuant to Section 987.93 with respect to cooperative dwelling units in lieu of, or in addition to, the provisions of this section, before the purchase of any property by the department there shall be filed with the department (1) an appraisement of the market value of the property by an employee or an authorized agent of the department, (2) an appraisement of the market value of the property by either the Federal Housing Administration or the Veteran’s Administration, and in addition there may be filed with the department an appraisement of the market value of the property by an authorized appraiser of a banking corporation formed under the laws of this state or of a national banking association having a place of business in this state, or (3) an appraisement of the market value of the property by an appraiser licensed or certified in this state.

######### 987.68.  
The department, before consummating a purchase under the provisions of this article, shall cause the title of the property sought to be purchased to be examined and may require for that purpose an abstract, an unlimited certificate of title, or a policy of title insurance, and may refer the same to the Attorney General for his opinion.



######### 987.69.  
The department shall then enter into a contract with the veteran for the sale of the property to the veteran. The department shall fix the selling price of the property as the purchase price thereof, as the total cost of improvements constructed, or as the value of the property, as determined by the department when the property is acquired by the department in a manner other than by purchase, to which the department may add all expenses incurred and estimated to be incurred by the department in relation thereto, inclusive of interest, administration, appraisals, examination of title, insurance premiums, mortgage guaranty fees, origination fees, incidental expenses, and the sum deemed necessary to meet unforeseen contingencies. In the case of real property acquired for the purpose of constructing improvements thereon, the department shall forthwith after acquiring that real property enter into the contract with the veteran authorized by this section at a selling price that does not exceed the department’s appraised value of the land, if the loan is to include the value of the land, and the amount of the department’s appraised value of the improvements to be constructed thereon and any of the other additions herein authorized. After the execution of the contract between the veteran and the department and the making of the initial payment thereon the department shall be authorized to pay the cost of the improvements contracted to be constructed on the real property, making progress payments thereon in the amounts and at those times that the department approves. The department shall, upon written request of the veteran and his or her contractor, have authority to approve additions to or deletions from the improvements contracted to be constructed and any savings affected or added cost incurred shall be deducted from or added to the amount due the department by the veteran under the terms of his or her contract.

The department may establish provisions under regulations adopted by the department pursuant to Section 987.93 with respect to cooperative dwelling units in lieu of, or in addition to, those set forth in this section.

Where the department enters into a contract for the sale of property on trust to an Indian veteran, the contract shall include the following conditions:

(a) The dwelling house or other improvements contracted to be constructed on trust land shall be completed in compliance with the standards of the building code applicable on the trust land. If there is no building code in force on the trust land, the applicable standards shall be those of the building code of the county in which the trust land is located.

(b) On the completion of construction, the Indian veteran shall provide to the department an inspection certificate from a qualified building inspector certifying that the dwelling house or other improvements comply with the standards of the building code as required by subdivision (a).



######### 987.71.  
(a) The purchaser shall make an initial payment of at least 2 percent of the selling price of the property or a higher amount that shall be determined based upon the creditworthiness of the purchaser, and with consideration of their military record, employment record, financial condition, and other similar factors as determined by the department. The department may waive the initial payment in any case where the value of the property as determined by the department from an appraisal equals the amount to be paid by the department plus at least 5 percent. In the case of a purchase requiring a loan guaranty by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the department may waive the initial payment and the purchaser shall pay the loan guaranty fee, which may be added to the loan amount. The department may require the purchaser to pay a loan origination fee, not to exceed 1 percent of the loan amount, which may be added to the loan amount.

(b) The balance of the loan amount may be amortized over a period fixed by the department, not exceeding 40 years for farms or homes, not including cooperative housing stock related to mobilehomes, and not exceeding 30 years for mobilehomes, including cooperative housing stock related to mobilehomes, located in mobilehome parks, as defined in Section 18214 of the Health and Safety Code, together with interest thereon at the rate determined by the department pursuant to Section 987.87 for these amortization purposes.

(c) The department may, in order to allow the veteran to purchase the home selected without incurring excessive monthly payments, at the time of initial purchase, postpone the commencement of payment of the principal balance for a period not to exceed five years if the veteran’s current income meets the standards for purchase on these terms and if the department determines, in accordance with previously established criteria for these determinations, that the veteran’s income can reasonably be expected to increase sufficiently within the five-year period to make the transition to fully amortized principal and interest payments, so long as the total term of the contract of purchase does not exceed 40 years, or 30 years where the contract relates to a mobilehome located in a mobilehome park, as defined in Section 18214 of the Health and Safety Code.

(d) The purchaser on any installment date may pay any or all installments still remaining unpaid.

(e) In any individual case, the department may for good cause postpone, from time to time, upon terms the department determines to be proper, the payment of the whole or any part of any installment of the purchase price, impounds, fees, charges, or interest thereon. The amount postponed shall be due and payable upon the payment in full of the contract, or upon sale, refinance, or transfer of the farm or home. A loan may be secured by a deed of trust or, if authorized by the department, another form of security.

(f) Each installment shall include an amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the participation contract to which the interest of the department is subject, and any amount as may be required by a covenant or provision contained in any resolution of issuance.

(g) When a purchaser makes an initial payment of less than 20 percent of the selling price of the property, the department shall do all of the following:

(1) Take prudent measures to minimize losses from loan defaults and loan delinquencies.

(2) A deferred-payment second loan described in paragraph (1) is subject to all of the following conditions:

(A) The loan may not exceed 5 percent of the selling price of the farm or home.

(B) The loan shall be secured by a deed of trust or, if authorized by the department, another form of security.

(C) The loan shall be due and payable upon the payment in full of the contract or upon the sale, refinance, or transfer of the farm or home.



######### 987.72.  
The provisions of Section 987.71, relative to the rate of interest to be charged to veteran purchasers do not apply to assignees of such purchasers who are not veterans, but as to such assignees the rate of interest shall be as fixed by the department, compounded at periods fixed by the department.

The action of the department in refusing to permit any assignments except as provided in this section is hereby ratified and confirmed, it having at all times been the intent of the Legislature that Section 987.71 apply to veteran purchasers only.



######### 987.721.  
(a) Notwithstanding Section 987.72, upon the dissolution of marriage or legal separation of a veteran contract purchaser and the veteran’s spouse, an assignment may be made in favor of the nonveteran former spouse at the same rate of interest and upon the same terms and conditions as are provided to veteran purchasers provided the veteran’s entire beneficial interest is transferred to the spouse and provided there are one or more dependent children of the veteran occupying the property and the spouse continues to reside in the home and make the payments in the same amount required by the purchase contract. For purposes of this subdivision, any child of the veteran who is legally adopted or who acquires a separate domicile or marries shall not be considered a dependent child. 

(b) Should the veteran retain entire beneficial interest in the property after dissolution or legal separation, the veteran may continue as purchaser provided either the veteran or the former spouse continues to occupy the property.



######### 987.73.  
(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), the department in each individual case may specify the terms of the contract entered into with the purchaser, but no property sold under this article shall, voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, be transferred, assigned, encumbered, leased, let or sublet, in whole or in part, nor shall any mobilehome be removed from its original site, except in case of emergency where temporary removal is necessary to avoid potential damage, without the written consent of the department, until the purchaser has paid therefor in full and has complied with all the terms and conditions of this contract of purchase. The department may give its written consent to such transfers, assignments, encumbrances, leasings, lettings or sublettings, or removals, for good cause shown, subject to the interest of the department and consistent with the purposes of this article.

(b) The consent of the department shall not be required where a veteran, alone or jointly with his spouse, transfers his interest in property which is the subject of a loan agreement with the department into a revocable trust established for the benefit of the veteran or of the veteran and his spouse. 

(c) The department may consent to an assignment in favor of a nonveteran spouse if a veteran purchaser qualifies as “a person in long-term care” as defined in Section 14050.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code if the department is satisfied that the interest of the veteran is adequately protected. If consent is given to the assignment, the contract shall continue at the same rate of interest and upon the same terms and conditions as are provided to veteran purchasers. Consent by the department to the assignment shall be deemed given if the assignment is pursuant to a court order, and if notice of the hearing was provided to the department at least 30 days prior to the hearing at which the court order was issued.



######### 987.74.  
(a) All properties purchased by the department shall be covered by insurance. Except as set forth in regulations adopted by the department pursuant to Section 987.93 in lieu of, or in addition to, the provisions of this subdivision, with respect to cooperative dwelling units, insurance purchased by the department shall be guaranteed replacement cost coverage as described in subdivisions (e) and (f) of Section 10102 of the Insurance Code against fire and other hazards for the full replacement cost of the improvements or structures, shall include limited building code upgrade as described in Section 10103 of the Insurance Code, and shall be placed with a company or companies as the department may determine from time to time.

The department may charge purchasers a premium to cover the cost to the department for insurance obtained pursuant to this subdivision. The premium shall not exceed the actual cost to the department for the coverage provided.

(b) The contract made between the department and the purchaser shall provide that the purchaser maintain the farm or home as his or her place of residence and keep in good order and repair all buildings, fences, and other permanent improvements situated thereon. Insurance policies purchased by the department shall be obtained to insure and keep insured against fire and other hazards, all buildings, fences, and other permanent improvements on the property. All policies shall be written with any loss payable to the department and the purchaser as their interests may appear. Insurance shall be in the amount, with the insurance companies, and under the terms and conditions as may be specified by the department.

(c) Upon renewal, the department shall assist the purchaser in determining the insurance level necessary to repair or replace the damaged or destroyed dwelling with like or equivalent construction and in determining how best to purchase additional coverage, if desired. The purchaser shall be solely responsible for requesting in writing and maintaining any additional amounts of insurance necessary to protect his or her interest in the property, and shall bear the risk of any loss in excess of the amount of insurance in force at the time of the loss.

(d) The department shall annually send a disclosure notice to all purchasers who have residential property insurance provided through the department. The notice shall identify the type of coverage, and shall disclose all of the following in a clear and reasonable manner:

(1) The limits of liability for the structure and improvements.

(5) A statement that the policy provided by the department provides limited building code upgrade coverage and the applicable limits and restrictions to that coverage.



######### 987.75.  
(a) If the purchaser or, if applicable, the related stock corporation, fails or neglects to pay, satisfy, and discharge at maturity all taxes and assessments, and all other charges and encumbrances which are a lien upon the property being purchased from the department, or any part thereof, and also all taxes and assessments levied or assessed upon the interest created by the contract of purchase of such property; or to keep the buildings, fences, other permanent improvements upon such property insured and in good order and repair, or to keep the crops upon such property insured; or to keep in good order and repair all buildings, fences, and other permanent improvements situated upon such property; then, in such event, the department may pay, satisfy, discharge, settle, or compromise the taxes, assessments, charges, or encumbrances, or insure the buildings, fences, permanent improvements, or crops, or do the work and supply the materials necessary to keep the buildings, fences, and other improvements in good order and repair. All moneys so expended by the department shall be added to the selling price of the property and bear interest at the rate of interest designated in Section 987.71 from the date of expending the same, and shall be repaid by the purchaser to the department on demand. The department may amortize the repayment of such expenditures or permit repayment in installments upon the terms and conditions which it deems proper.

(b) The department may establish provisions under regulations adopted by the department pursuant to Section 987.93 with respect to cooperative dwelling units in lieu of, or in addition to, the provisions of this section.



######### 987.76.

######### 987.77.  
In the event of a failure of a purchaser to comply with any of the terms of his or her contract of purchase, the department may cancel such contract, and thereupon be released from all obligations, at law or in equity, to convey the property, and the purchaser shall forfeit all right thereto. All payments theretofore made shall be deemed to be rental paid for occupancy. Upon such forfeiture, the department shall take possession of the property covered by such contract, and shall remove all persons and personal property therefrom without any liability whatsoever on the part of the department or of any official or employee thereof for any damage or injury caused by or incident to the entry or removal. The failure of the department to exercise any option to cancel or to exercise any other privilege under such contract for any default shall not constitute a waiver of the right to exercise such option or privilege for any other default on the part of the purchaser. The department shall allow a stock cooperative, as defined in subdivision (m) of Section 1351 of the Civil Code, the opportunity to cure any failure by a purchaser described in this section.



######### 987.775.  
Whenever the department proceeds under Section 987.77 to declare a forfeiture and to retain all payments made under the forfeited contract as rental paid for occupancy, the department may, in lieu of paying any net gain to the purchaser in accordance with Section 987.79, deposit that net gain into a segregated account in the Veterans’ Farm and Home Building Fund of 1943 created to receive funds pursuant to this section. The funds in the account shall be accumulated until June 30 of each year, and any losses on the sales of forfeited properties during the fiscal year shall be deducted from the total of the net gains deposited in the account during the fiscal year. The department may expend the funds remaining in the account on June 30 each year, after deduction for losses on sales of forfeited properties, for purposes of assistance to lower income purchasers pursuant to subdivision (c), (e), or (h) of Section 987.71.



######### 987.78.  
(a) In the event of a forfeiture of a contract of purchase under this article, the department may sell or otherwise dispose of the property covered by the forfeited contract to any person and upon any terms and conditions as it determines to be proper, under the conditions set forth in this section.

(b) The department shall give first preference to a veteran who qualifies under this article and who served during a time of war, second preference to any other person serving in or honorably discharged from the armed forces of the United States, third preference to any person who is a first-time home buyer, and fourth preference to any other person.

(c) Where the department elects in the event of a forfeiture to sell or otherwise dispose of an assignment of an Indian veteran’s beneficial interest or of a leasehold interest in allotment trust land, the department shall first offer it for sale to the person or persons for whom the land is held in trust, including an Indian veteran having a beneficial interest in the trust land on which the forfeiture occurred, at a price equal to the unpaid balance of the contract price. If none of the persons for whom the land is held in trust accepts the offer, the department shall next offer it to the United States Secretary of the Interior at the same price.

(d) Where the department elects in the event of forfeiture to sell or otherwise dispose of a leasehold interest in tribal trust land, the department shall first offer it for sale to the tribe for whom the land is held in trust at a price equal to the unpaid balance of the contract price. If the tribe fails to accept the offer, the department shall next offer it to the United States Secretary of the Interior at the same price.

(e) Where all the parties to whom the department is required to offer the property under subdivision (c) or (d) fail to accept the offer, the department may sell or otherwise dispose of the property covered by the forfeited contract as provided by subdivision (a) and, in so doing, the department shall give first preference to any good faith offer by a person approved by the tribal council of the reservation, rancheria, or land held under the jurisdiction of that particular tribal governing body on which the allotment land is sited.

(f) If the property is subject to a participation contract, the department may, at its option, pay the balance due upon the participation contract, including accrued interest, without penalty.

(g) Nothing in this section invalidates a transfer to, or affects the interest of, a good faith purchaser for value without notice of any failure of the department to comply with any requirement of this section in the disposition of any property subject to a forfeited contract.



######### 987.785.  
Except as set forth in regulations adopted by the department pursuant to Section 987.93 with respect to a cooperative dwelling unit, whenever the department cancels a contract and takes possession of a property pursuant to Section 987.77 and elects to sell the property covered by a forfeited contract, the department may, at its option, establish a procedure for listing the property for sale, together with similarly located properties, with a licensed real estate broker. The department may, in this connection, prepare schedules of properties available for sale by geographic areas and may offer a schedule from time to time to any licensed real estate broker within the geographic area covered by the schedule for a fee which shall be sufficient to cover the costs to the department in compiling the schedules and making them available. If the department enters into a real estate listing agreement, exclusive or otherwise, with a licensed real estate broker, the department shall cooperate with the broker in all customary respects and make the property available at reasonable times for inspections by prospective purchasers.



######### 987.79.  
(a) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b), the department may, in the contract of purchase with a veteran, provide that, in the event of default by the veteran and forfeiture of his or her rights under the contract and subsequent sale of the property by the department, it may pay to the veteran any net gain realized by the department upon the sale.

The department may lease or let the property, in whole or in part, upon any terms that the department determines to be proper. In the case of a farm, the department may cultivate the farm or harvest the crop.

(b) Whenever the department determines to lease or let any reverted property pursuant to subdivision (a), the department may give first priority to public or private organizations serving homeless veterans if the property is zoned for that use and all state and local building permit and use conditions are met. The department may give second priority to a public housing authority organized pursuant to the Housing Authorities Law (Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 34200) of Part 2 of Division 24 of the Health and Safety Code) for leasing or letting to persons of low income, as defined in Section 34213 of the Health and Safety Code.



######### 987.81.  
If illness or accident prevents a purchaser of a farm from cultivating his farm or harvesting any crop, the department may enter and cultivate the farm or harvest the crop. In such event the department has a first lien upon the crop for all moneys expended and may sell the harvested crop. Out of the proceeds of the sale the department may reimburse itself for any expense which it has incurred in the cultivation of the farm, the harvesting of crops and the sale thereof, and retain any moneys due to the department from the purchaser. Any balance shall be paid by the department to the purchaser.



######### 987.82.  
When a purchaser dies, indebted to the department under contract of purchase, his rights acquired under this article and such contract shall devolve upon his heirs, devisees, or personal representatives, but subject to all rights, claims, and charges of the department. Default on the part of an heir, devisee, or personal representative, with respect to any right, claim, or charge of the department shall have the same effect as would default on the part of the purchaser but for his death.



######### 987.83.  
For the purposes of carrying out the Veterans’ Farm and Home Purchase Act of 1974 the Director of Finance may by executive order authorize the withdrawal from the General Fund of an amount or amounts not to exceed the amount of the unsold bonds which have been authorized to be sold for the purpose of carrying out this article, and the amount necessary to carry out this section is hereby appropriated without regard to fiscal years. Any amounts withdrawn shall be deposited in the Veterans’ Farm and Home Building Fund of 1974. Any moneys made available under this section to the department shall be returned to the General Fund in such amounts as may be received by the department from the sale of bonds sold for the purpose of carrying out this article, together with interest at the rate of interest fixed in the bonds so sold.



######### 987.84.  
Except as may otherwise be permitted by the department pursuant to regulations adopted by the department pursuant to Section 987.93, the right to declare a forfeiture for breach of a condition contained in any deed to real property or in any cooperative dwelling unit ownership documents may not be enforced as against the interest of the department in said property or any portion thereof.



######### 987.85.  
(a) The department shall not acquire a home in which the veteran has an interest of record except in the following instances:

The maximum amount that the department may advance under this subdivision is limited to the maximum amounts set forth in Section 987.65 at the time the application is made for the subsequent loan.

(b) Only one farm or home purchased under this article shall be owned by a veteran or a veteran and the veteran’s spouse at any one time. This subdivision does not apply to an interest of a former spouse.



######### 987.87.  
(a) The department shall establish the actual interest rate to be paid. To this end, the department, within 60 days of receipt of the survey of the financial condition of the Division of Farm and Home Purchases required at the close of each fiscal year conducted by an independent public accounting firm of recognized standing as provided under various veterans bond acts, shall report to the California Veterans Board and the Veterans’ Finance Committee of 1943, regarding the recommended uniform rate of interest payable upon the amount remaining unpaid under any veteran’s purchase contract executed on or after September 26, 1974. The department shall make its finding as to the rate of interest to be charged, determined by a floating rate based upon the actual cost of general obligation bond and revenue bond sales, plus a certain percent for administrative costs, taking into consideration the current value of money, the solvency of the Veterans’ Farm and Home Building Fund of 1943, and the interest paid on any participation contracts to which the interest of the department may be subject. Upon approval by the board and the committee, the department may raise or lower the effective rate of interest payable under these contracts annually as it deems to be for the best interests of the department, as well as the contractholders, if in so doing this action is made applicable alike to any and all of these contracts. The interest rate shall not be raised so that the effective date of a higher rate of interest occurs more than once in any calendar year, unless the board and committee, by a two-thirds vote of the members of each, make a finding that an additional increase in the interest rate is necessary to enable the department to maintain the financial solvency of the fund or to meet its obligations to bondholders or purchasers. At least 90 days’ advance written notice to the contractholders shall be given before any increase in the interest rate becomes effective.

(b) The total amount of any installment payment shall be raised or lowered to reflect any change in the effective rate of interest. The department may, however, adjust or postpone any installment payment for good cause pursuant to Section 987.71 and, for these purposes, good cause shall include a consideration of whether an increased installment payment would be excessively burdensome in light of a purchaser’s financial circumstances. The department shall include notice of this provision in the 90 days’ advance notice required under subdivision (a).

(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (a) and Section 987.875, the department may establish separate rates of interest payable on the amounts remaining unpaid under veterans’ purchase contracts for any and all contractholders who are called to active duty in the military service of the United States, and who qualify for relief under the provisions of the federal Soldier’s and Sailor’s Civil Relief Act of 1940, as amended. The rates need not be uniform for all who qualify, but shall not be greater than the rate provided for in that act. Rates shall be established at the discretion of the department, and may apply to any contract from the date of entry into active duty to, and including, 90 days after the date of release from active duty.



######### 987.875.  
Notwithstanding Section 987.87 or any other provision of law, the department shall report to the California Veterans Board and the Veterans’ Finance Committee of 1943, regarding the recommended rate of interest payable upon the amount remaining unpaid under any veteran’s purchase contract executed on or after January 1, 1999. The department, from time to time, shall establish and may modify, subject to the approval of the board and the committee, the actual rates to be paid, which may be fixed interest rates or variable interest rates, or the methodology and timing for determining or modifying the actual interest rates to be paid, which methodology may produce fixed interest rates or variable interest rates on purchase contracts executed on or after January 1, 1999. The interest rates need not be uniform for all the purchase contracts. The interest rates shall be determined by the department in accordance with guidelines established by the board and the committee.



######### 987.88.  
(a) In the event the department enters into a master agreement with one or more insurance companies to provide life or disability insurance coverage for the purchasers of farms and homes from the department, the master agreement shall provide that the life insurance will be offered to purchasers who are disabled solely as a result of their qualifying military service and to nondisabled purchasers on an equal basis and that no purchaser shall be denied coverage solely because that purchaser has a qualifying military service-connected disability at the time of application. Notwithstanding Part 2 (commencing with Section 10110) of Division 2 of the Insurance Code, the life or disability insurance shall be a form of group life or group disability insurance.

(b) The master agreement shall provide for maintenance of those reserves as the department, after consultation with the Insurance Commissioner, deems appropriate and prudent, and the department may use from time to time any accumulated surplus in those reserves, or any refunds or returns therefrom upon termination of the agreement, for the purposes of this article or of any veterans general obligation or revenue bond act. Any and all acts of the department in maintaining and using the reserves consistent with this subdivision are hereby ratified and confirmed, it having at all times been the intent of the Legislature that reserves be maintained and that any surpluses therein or refunds or returns therefrom be used by the department for the purposes stated in this subdivision.

(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), on and after January 1, 1987, any reserves maintained under the master agreement shall not exceed a level greater than 20 percent in excess of actuarial requirements plus a reasonable contingency reserve, as determined annually by the department, and the department may contract with one or more independent actuaries or actuarial firms to assist the department in the annual determination.

(d) Any departmental proposal to enter into, revise, amend, renew, extend, or cancel, any agreement described in this section shall be a policy change subject to subdivisions (b), (c), and (d) of Section 84.



######### 987.881.  
The insurance company or companies may provide life and disability insurance pursuant to Section 987.88 by one or more separate accounts.



######### 987.89.  
The action of a veteran purchaser for damages against any third party does not affect his right of action for all damages against any party other than the department. If the department indemnifies, or becomes obligated to indemnify, the veteran purchaser, it may likewise bring an action against any such third party responsible for damage to the contract property. In the latter event, the department may recover in the same suit all payments made on behalf of the veteran purchaser.

If either the veteran purchaser or the department brings an action against such third party, the veteran purchaser or the department, as the case may be, shall forthwith give to the other written notice of the action and of the name of the court in which the action is brought, by personal service or registered mail. Proof of such service shall be filed in such action. If the action is brought by either the veteran purchaser or the department, the other may, at any time before trial on the facts, join as party plaintiff, or shall consolidate the action if brought independently.

The court shall first apply, out of the entire amount of any judgment for any damage recovered by the veteran purchaser, a sufficient amount to reimburse the department for the amount of its expenditures for indemnification. If the department has not joined in the action or has not brought action, or if the action has not been consolidated, the court, on the department’s application, shall allow as a first lien against the entire amount of any judgment for any damages recovered by the veteran purchaser, the amount of the department’s expenditures for indemnification.



######### 987.90.  
For the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Veterans’ Farm and Home Purchase Act of 1974, there is hereby appropriated, and the department is hereby authorized to utilize the proceeds derived from the Veterans Bond Act of 1974, and from all veterans bond acts subsequent thereto, and to combine such funds up to a percent to be established by the Veterans Finance Committee and reported to the Legislature annually, with funds derived from participation contracts.

Solar energy heating devices for swimming pools, hot tubs, saunas, and spas shall not qualify for any expenditure pursuant to this section except in the case of veterans who were wounded or disabled as a result of their service and who provide medical evidence satisfactory to the department that a heated swimming pool, hot tub, sauna, or spa, is therapeutically necessary.



######### 987.93.  
Where the property consists of a cooperative dwelling unit:

(a) The purchaser’s right to occupy the property under its contract with the department shall not be subject to consent or approval by the stock cooperative, as defined in subdivision (m) of Section 1351 of the Civil Code, nor shall there be any fee or surcharge imposed by the stock cooperative as a result of the right of occupancy, provided that the foregoing shall not affect the rights that the stock cooperative may have under the applicable cooperative dwelling unit ownership documents to approve the initial acquisition of the cooperative dwelling unit by the department on behalf of the purchaser.

(b) As a condition to taking title to a cooperative dwelling unit, the department shall require that the stock cooperative enter into an agreement directly with the department, which agreement shall be in a form established by the department and shall provide for such matters as the department may determine relating to (1) the enforcement by the stock cooperative of its rights in the event that the purchaser defaults under the cooperative dwelling unit ownership documents, (2) the enforcement by the department of its rights in the event the purchaser defaults under its contract with the department, and (3) such other matters as the department may determine to be necessary to reasonably protect its interest in the property.



The department may adopt regulations necessary to implement this article for cooperative dwelling units that are consistent with the objectives and purposes of this article and in a manner in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).

##### ARTICLE 5y. The Veterans Housing and Homeless Prevention Bond Act of 2014 [998.540 - 998.557]  

######### 998.540.  
This article shall be known and may be cited as the Veterans Housing and Homeless Prevention Bond Act of 2014.



######### 998.541.  
(a) California is home to almost two million veterans, more than any other state in the nation, and with the winding down of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, an unprecedented number of California veterans will return to our communities, many in need of housing, employment, mental health and drug treatment, and physical rehabilitation.

(b) Unfortunately, California also leads the nation in the number of homeless veterans, roughly 25 percent of the nation’s homeless veterans live in California, approximately 19,000 veterans. According to the California Research Bureau, Los Angeles is number one in terms of the number of homeless veterans followed by the San Diego region at number three, and the San Francisco Bay Area at number nine.

(c) Moreover, the face of the nation’s homeless veterans’ population is changing as more OIF/OEF veterans find themselves in a downward spiral towards homelessness and, increasingly, female veterans and their children comprise more and more of the homeless veteran demographic.

(d) With their higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, and unemployment, as well as the higher incidence of sexual trauma experienced by our female veterans, current homeless veterans, all too often, cycle in and out of our jails, hospitals, and treatment programs, disproportionately drawing down services without receiving the proper services to stabilize their lives.

(e) The Legislature must advance a comprehensive, coordinated, and cost-effective approach to respond to the housing needs of our veterans. Such an approach should leverage public and private resources as well as align housing and services.

(f) Five years ago, Californians overwhelmingly affirmed their gratitude to our veterans by approving Proposition 12, a nine hundred million dollars ($900,000,000) general obligation bond intended to help veterans specifically purchase single family homes, farms, and mobilehomes through the CalVet Home Loan Program.

(g) As a result of the nation’s economic crisis and state’s housing downturn coupled with the changing demographics of our veterans, the Farm and Home Loan Program, as approved by Proposition 12, has been significantly undersubscribed. Five years since its passage, the full nine hundred million dollars ($900,000,000) remains unspent as does a portion of the five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) from Proposition 32, which was approved by the voters in 2000.

(h) Meanwhile, the need of veterans for multifamily housing that is affordable, supportive, and transitional remains unmet and public and private resources available for these purposes remain underutilized.

(i) California voters should be granted the opportunity to restructure the Proposition 12 veterans’ bond program to better respond to the housing needs as well as the changing demographics of the current veteran population.

(j) The Veterans Housing and Homeless Prevention Bond Act of 2014 will restructure six hundred million dollars ($600,000,000) of the existing Proposition 12 bond moneys to allow for the construction and rehabilitation of multifamily housing for veterans and prioritize projects that align housing with services. Even with this restructuring of bond moneys, the act still preserves over half a billion dollars for the existing CalVet Farm and Home Loan Program.

(k) The Veterans Housing and Homeless Prevention Bond Act of 2014 will expand housing and service options for veterans, cost-effectively leverage public dollars, reduce the number of homeless veterans and its attendant public costs, and place California at the forefront of our nation’s efforts to end veterans’ homelessness by 2015. 



######### 998.542.

Undivided interest so assigned or pledged shall not exceed the amount of principal and interest of the debentures secured thereby, and shall be secondary and subordinate to any interest or right of the people and the holders of general obligation bonds in the fund under any general obligation veterans bond act.

(b) In that event, the department shall deposit the proceeds of the sale of the debentures and the revenues therefrom in the Veterans’ Farm and Home Building Fund of 1943, and money may be withdrawn therefrom in accordance with law upon requisition of the department for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter and of the Veterans’ Farm and Home Purchase Act of 1943 and the Veterans’ Farm and Home Purchase Act of 1974.

Refunding debentures may be issued and delivered as outstanding debentures or obligations to be refunded thereby, if the debentures are mature or are about to mature or are subject to call or redemption, or if the retirement thereof has been assured by consent of the holders thereof. Refunding debentures may be delivered in whole or in part in exchange for outstanding debentures or obligations with the consent of the holders thereof.

######### 1005.2.  
The department may in any resolution of issuance define the events of default including among others default in the payment of the principal or interest upon or premium due upon any debentures or default by the department in the observance of any of the covenants, agreements or conditions on its part to be performed under the resolution of issuance and may provide that upon the happening of any such event of default the holders of not less than the majority in aggregate principal amount of the debentures at the time outstanding will be entitled to declare the principal of all of the debentures then outstanding and the interest accrued thereon to be immediately due and payable.



######### 1005.4.

######### 1005.5.  
No remedy conferred upon or reserved to the holders of debentures is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies now or hereafter provided by law and each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given under this chapter or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.



######### 1005.6.  
While any of the debentures remain outstanding the powers, duties or existence of the department and of every other official or agency of the State of California shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will adversely affect the interests and rights of the holders of the debentures.








##### ARTICLE 7. Miscellaneous [1006.1 - 1006.16]  

######### 1006.1.  
All debentures and the income therefrom are at all times exempt from taxation in the State of California, except for transfer, inheritance, and gift taxes.



######### 1006.2.  
All debentures shall be legal investments for all trust funds, for the funds of all insurance companies, banks (both commercial and savings), trust companies, state school funds and any pension funds, public or private.



######### 1006.3.  
Any money or funds which may by law be invested in bonds of the State of California may be invested in debentures.



######### 1006.4.  
Whenever any bonds of the State of California may by law be used as security for the performance of any act or the deposit of any public money, debentures may be so used.



######### 1006.5.  
All debentures, subject to the provisions for registration contained therein, are negotiable instruments under the law merchant.



######### 1006.6.  
The department may include in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of debentures any provisions not inconsistent with this chapter which limit, restrict or regulate the holding, deposit, investment, and application of money consisting of the proceeds from the sale of the debentures or the revenues or other income received from the pledged contracts entered into by the department with veterans, and such provisions shall constitute a contract with the holders of the debentures and shall be binding upon the department and all other officers, officials and agencies of the State of California and upon the state so long as any of the debentures are outstanding.



######### 1006.7.  
The department may provide in the proceedings authorizing issuance of debentures for the establishment of one or more reserve funds out of the proceeds of the sale of the debentures or out of revenues or out of any moneys or securities available to the department under this act, and may provide for the use and application of any surplus moneys in any such reserve fund.



######### 1006.8.  
The State Treasurer may sell any of the debentures authorized under this chapter to the United States of America or to any of its departments, agencies or instrumentalities upon such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon, and the department is specifically authorized to enter into any such agreements, terms and conditions required by the United States of America or any of its departments, agencies or instrumentalities as a condition to the purchase of such debentures.



######### 1006.9.  
Warrants for the payments to be made on account of the debentures either as to principal, interest, premium, or otherwise, shall be duly drawn by the State Controller, upon the request of the State Treasurer, whenever the drawing of such warrants is required in order to make such payments.



######### 1006.10.  
Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter, the proceeds received from the sale of debentures and any revenues received by the department from pledged contracts entered into by the department may be used to defray any expenses incurred by the department or the State Treasurer in connection with and incidental to the issuance and sale of debentures including expenses for preparation, inspections and examinations, surveys and reports, which may be required by the purchasers of debentures, and any legal opinions deemed necessary or advisable by the department in connection with the issuance of debentures except that the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such debentures may contain appropriate provisions governing the use and application of the proceeds from the sale of the debentures or other revenues received by the department for the purposes above specified.



######### 1006.11.  
This chapter shall be liberally construed to carry out the objects and purposes and the declared public policy of the State of California as in this chapter set forth. The facts with which the Legislature is fully cognizant are:

The State of California is committed to aid and assist veterans under the Veterans’ Farm and Home Purchase Act of 1974.  Increasing numbers of servicemen who served in Vietnam are being discharged and need home loans.  The Cal-Vet loan program must be updated to provide comparable benefits to those provided veterans of World War II and the Korean Conflict.  Conditions in the money market render it impracticable for the State of California in conformity with its other commitments to continue to raise funds for veterans’ aid through the issuance and sale of general obligation bonds of the state.  There is now in the Department of Veterans Affairs a backlog of applications which cannot be processed because funds are inadequate to meet the demand for loans.  This act provides another method whereby the State of California will be able to raise the necessary funds for the aid and assistance of veterans through the issuance of revenue debentures payable exclusively from the proceeds of contracts of sale of properties acquired by the department from veterans’ revenue debenture proceeds and resold to veterans without imposing any liability upon the State of California and without creating any debt or liability of the State of California.  The urgent requirements of veterans and the necessity of raising funds immediately for their aid and assistance render it essential that this law be adopted.



######### 1006.12.  
If any section, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid or unenforceable, such decision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining portions of the chapter. The Legislature hereby declares that it would have passed this chapter and each section, subdivision, sentence, clause and phrase hereof irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses and phrases may be declared unconstitutional, invalid or unenforceable.



######### 1006.13.  
This chapter shall not operate to rescind or repeal any act of the State of California now or hereafter enacted providing for the issuance of general obligation bonds of the State of California for the purpose of financing the Veterans’ Farm and Home Purchase Act of 1974 or for purposes similar to those set forth in the Veterans’ Farm and Home Purchase Act of 1974 provided such bonds are either payable out of the General Fund of the State of California or the full faith and credit of said state is pledged for the payment of both the principal of and interest thereon.



######### 1006.14.  
All money in any of the funds created or authorized to be created in any resolution of issuance under the provisions of this chapter is hereby appropriated for expenditure in carrying out the purposes herein and therein provided.



######### 1006.15.  
The purchaser shall make an initial payment of at least 10 percent of the selling price of the property, in case of a farm, and 5 percent in the case of a home. The department may waive the initial payment in any case where the value of the property as determined by the department appraisal shall be equal to the amount to be paid by the department plus at least 10 percent in the case of a farm, and 5 percent in the case of a home. The balance of the purchase price may be amortized over a period fixed by the department, not exceeding 40 years, together with interest thereon at the rate as determined by the department for such amortization purposes. The department shall establish the actual interest rate to be paid. To this end the department, by two-thirds vote of the California Veterans Board, with the approval of the Veterans’ Debenture Finance Committee established by Section 1000.3 of this code, is empowered to establish a uniform rate of interest payable upon the amount remaining unpaid under all pledged veterans’ purchase contracts then or thereafter executed. The California Veterans Board and the Veterans’ Debenture Finance Committee shall periodically at least once each year make a finding as to the rate of interest to be charged, taking into consideration the requirements of the Veterans’ Debenture Revenue Fund created by this chapter, but subject to any covenant contained in any resolution of issuance adopted in accordance with this chapter pursuant to which debentures are at the time outstanding. Subject to any such covenant, the department may raise or lower the rate of interest payable under such contracts for any given period as many times and as frequently as it deems to be for the best interests of the department, if in so doing its action is made applicable alike to any and all pledged contract holders and 30 days’ advance notice is given of the time when the new rate of interest is to become effective. Upon demand of the Veterans’ Debenture Finance Committee, given as provided in any resolution of issuance adopted pursuant to this chapter, the department shall increase the rate of interest to be charged upon the amount remaining unpaid upon all pledged veterans’ purchase contracts then in existence. A change in the interest rate may affect the total amount of any installment payment. The purchaser on any installment date may pay any or all installments still remaining unpaid. Subject to any covenant contained in any resolution of issuance adopted in accordance with this chapter, and pursuant to which debentures are at the time outstanding, the department may, in any individual case, for good cause postpone from time to time, upon such terms as the department deems proper, the payment of the whole or any part of any installment of the purchase price or interest thereon.

This section is intended to be applicable to all lands acquired from the proceeds of the sale of debentures issued hereunder and to the resale and disposition of such lands to the purchasers thereof and no other provision of law shall be applicable to the purchase or resale of such lands except only as in this act provided.



######### 1006.16.  
The department shall require that all applicants under this article qualify under the applicable federal laws and regulations governing the permitted uses of tax-exempt bond funds, and file within the time limits required under applicable federal laws and regulations.







##### CHAPTER 8. Veteran Farmers or Ranchers [1008 - 1008.5]  

######### 1008.  
The Legislature finds and declares the following:

(a) Agriculture is a major industry in California, with 81,700 farms and ranches. California agriculture is nearly a thirty-seven-billion-five-hundred-million-dollar ($37,500,000,000) industry that generates one hundred billion dollars ($100,000,000,000) in related economic activity.

(b) In 2010, the United States Department of Agriculture Secretary cited that the aging of principal farm operators across the nation is rising. The USDA Census of Agriculture, 2012 Census Highlights, finds that the average age of America’s principal farm operators is 58.3 years of age and one-third are 65 years or older.

(c) An 8-percent national decrease in the number of farmers and ranchers is expected to occur between the years 2008 and 2018.

(d) Recognizing the growth of America’s food production needs, and low proportions of beginning farmers and ranchers nationwide, the USDA Secretary identified America’s returning military veterans as a promising population to enter careers as farmers and ranchers. The 2014 United States Farm Bill contains various landmark incentives to assist military veterans and disadvantaged populations to become farmers and ranchers.

(e) In November 2014, the USDA announced the designation of the nation’s first USDA Military Veterans Agricultural Liaison to coordinate information, resources, and support for active duty military and veterans interested in entering careers as farmers and ranchers.

(f) The 2014 United States Farm Bill, also known as the Agricultural Act of 2014, contained various incentives designed to assist the nation’s returning military veterans to acquire skills needed to start and manage a farm. Incentives include, but are not limited to, farm loans and microloans, education and training and technical assistance, including training in natural resource conservation techniques and practices.

(g) Eight percent of the nation’s homeless population are military veterans and 45 percent of homeless veterans are African American or Latino, while less than 10 percent are women.

(h) More than six million veterans reside in rural America and approximately two million veterans are residents of California.

(i) California veterans use fewer benefits than their peers at the national level. While all veterans report only partial awareness of benefits for which they are eligible, some states have more advanced outreach programs to connect veterans to these available resources.

(j) The Legislature recognizes the opportunities to the state through landmark funding contained in the 2014 United States Farm Bill and subsequent United States Farm bills to assist military veterans in entering careers as farmers and ranchers.

(k) The Legislature acknowledges opportunities offered through a state and federal partnership to strengthen and enhance these resources to benefit California’s veterans and historically underserved populations.



######### 1008.5.  
(a) By July 1, 2018, the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency, the California Department of Veterans Affairs, and the California Department of Food and Agriculture, in consultation with the United States Department of Agriculture and the United States Farm Service Agency, and other federal agencies as needed, shall identify and post information pursuant to this section on their individual Internet Web sites as appropriate to assist, educate, train, and otherwise support California’s transitioning service members and returning military veterans to enter into farming or ranching careers in California.

(b) Information posted by the Department of Food and Agriculture pursuant to subdivision (a) shall include, but is not limited to, information on all of the following:

(1) The California Department of Food and Agriculture’s Healthy Soils Initiative.

(2) The 2014 United States Agricultural Act and subsequent agricultural acts.

(3) Farm loans offered through the United States Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency.

(4) The United States Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service.

(5) The federal Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program.

(c) Information posted by the Department of Veterans Affairs pursuant to subdivision (a) shall include, but is not limited to, information on the California Department of Veterans Affairs’ Farm and Home Loan Program and federal farm and home loan programs, as appropriate.

(d) Information posted by the Labor and Workforce Development Agency pursuant to subdivision (a) shall include, but is not limited to, information on training and employment services offered through the America’s Job Center of California, operating under the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency. It is the intent of the Legislature that the employment and training assistance provided through the America’s Job Center of California to military veterans seeking careers as farm operators and ranchers shall be in the same manner as the assistance provided to other career seekers.

The department may contract with any other state, federal, or private agency to conduct the investigation in its behalf.

(a) (1) All moneys and other personal property of any member other than that described in Section 1035 shall, upon the death of the member, first be paid to the administrator for payment of funeral expenses or any obligation owed to any home remaining unpaid after the disbursement required by Section 1035 is completed; and second, in the absence of an heir or heirs or a will, pass and descend to and become the property of the state for credit to the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund. If the total value of that property in the state over and above any amounts due the veteran for services in the Armed Forces of the United States or from any other employment does not exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), the home may, without procuring letters of administration, collect any money due the decedent, receive the property of the decedent, and have any evidences of interest, indebtedness, or right transferred to it upon furnishing the person, representative, corporation, official, or body owning the money, having custody of the property, or acting as registrar or transfer agent of the evidence of that interest, indebtedness, or right, with an affidavit showing the right of the home to receive the money or property or to have the evidences transferred. The receipt of the home shall constitute sufficient acquittance for any payment of money or delivery of property made pursuant to this section and shall fully discharge that person, representative, corporation, officer, or body from any further liability with reference thereto, without the necessity of inquiring into the truth of any of the facts stated in the affidavit. However, that payment or transfer does not preclude administration when necessary to enforce payment of the decedent’s debts, and the administrator may, upon proof determined to be sufficient, pay the debts directly and without administration.

If the total value of that property in the State of California over and above any amounts due the veteran for services in the Armed Forces of the United States or from any other employment does not exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), the home may, without procuring letters of administration or awaiting probate of any will, collect any money due the decedent, receive the property of the decedent and have any evidences of interest, indebtedness, or right transferred to it upon furnishing the person, representative, corporation, official, or body owning the money, having custody of that property, or acting as registrar or transfer agent of the evidence of that interest, indebtedness, or right, with an affidavit showing the right of the home to receive that money or property or to have those evidences transferred. The receipt of the home shall constitute sufficient acquittance for any payment of money or delivery of property made pursuant to this section and shall fully discharge the person, representative, corporation, officer, or body from any further liability with reference thereto, without the necessity of inquiring into the truth of any of the facts stated in the affidavit. However, the payment or transfer does not preclude administration when necessary to enforce payment of the decedent’s debts, and the administrator may, upon proof determined to be sufficient, pay those debts directly and without administration.

(9) Enter into a joint powers agreement for recreational or senior citizens’ services within the district.

(b) In conformance with this section, a district may provide recreational facilities or services at any location within the district regardless of the location of district-owned facilities.

Bonds of a district may be issued, sold, and the proceeds thereof expended in the exercise of any of the powers of the district or in the accomplishment of the purposes of this chapter whenever two-thirds of the registered electors of the district who vote upon a proposal to issue bonds vote in favor thereof.



######### 1211.  
The board may, and upon petition of eight per cent of the registered electors of the district shall, submit to the electors of the district the question whether bonds of the district shall be issued and sold for the purposes set forth by the board in the notice calling the election at which the question is submitted.



######### 1212.  
The question may be submitted at a special bond election called for that purpose or at a general district election.

The signature upon the coupons of the person who is county auditor at the date of such bonds shall be valid although the bonds themselves may be attested by a different person who is county auditor at the time of delivery of the bonds.



######### 1218.  
The board of supervisors at the time of making the levy of taxes for county purposes shall levy a tax for that year upon the taxable property in the district for the interest and redemption of district bonds.

All money so collected shall be paid into the county treasury to the credit of the district bond retirement fund and be used for the payment of the principal and interest on the bonds and for no other purpose until all bonded indebtedness of the district has been paid in full. The principal and interest on bonds shall be paid by the county treasurer upon the warrant of the county auditor out of the district bond retirement fund if that fund has sufficient moneys and otherwise out of any other funds of the district. The county auditor shall cancel and retain such bonds and coupons when he draws his warrants on the treasurer in favor of the owners thereof.



######### 1219.  
Whenever the bonds of a district have been investigated and certified by any officer of this state authorized to make such investigation and certification, and by the authority of such certification have been declared to be legal for investment by savings banks of this state, then such bonds may be lawfully purchased or received in pledge for loans by savings banks, building and loan associations, trust companies, insurance companies, guardians, conservators, executors, administrators, special administrators, or by any public officer within this state holding funds which by law may be invested or loaned.
