#### CHAPTER 3. Losses [280 - 294]  


##### ARTICLE 1. Navigation Rules [280 - 285]  

######### 280.  
The provisions of this article in addition to the provisions of other parts of this code which relate to navigation shall be observed by vessels when they meet.



######### 281.  
Whenever any vessel, whether a steam vessel or sailing vessel, proceeding in one direction, meets another vessel, whether a steam vessel or sailing vessel, proceeding in the opposite direction, so that if both were to continue their respective courses they would pass so near as to involve the risk of a collision, each shall give right rudder, so as to pass on the port side of each other. This rule applies to all steam vessels and all sailing vessels whether on the port or starboard tack, and whether close-hauled or not, except where the circumstances of the case are such as to render a departure from the rule necessary in order to avoid immediate danger. It is subject to a due regard to the dangers of navigation, and, as regards sailing vessels on the starboard tack close-hauled, it is subject also to the keeping of such sailing vessels under command.



######### 282.  
Sailing vessels, having the wind fair, shall give way to those on a wind. When both are going by the wind, the vessel on the starboard tack shall keep its wind, and the one on the port tack shall bear up strongly, so as to pass each other on the port side. When both vessels which have the wind large or abeam meet, they shall pass each other in the same way on the port side. To effect the two last-mentioned movements each shall give right rudder. Steam vessels shall be regarded as vessels navigating with a fair wind, and shall give way to sailing vessels on a wind of either tack.



######### 283.  
A steam vessel navigating a narrow channel shall, whenever it is safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or mid-channel which lies on its starboard side, and a steam vessel when passing another in such a channel, shall always leave the other upon the port side.



######### 284.  
When steam vessels will inevitably or necessarily cross so near that by continuing their respective courses, there would be a risk of collision, each shall give right rudder, so as always to pass on the port side of the other.



######### 285.  
The rules of this article do not apply to any case for which a different rule is provided by the regulations concerning lights upon steam vessels, or for the government of pilots of steam vessels approaching each other within the sound of the steam-whistle or other audible signal, prescribed by or under authority of the laws of the United States.








##### ARTICLE 2. Liability [290 - 294]  

######### 290.  
If a collision is occasioned by failure to observe any rule of Article 1 of this chapter, the owner of the vessel by which the rule is infringed can not recover compensation for damages sustained by the vessel unless the circumstances of the case made a departure from the rule necessary.



######### 291.  
Damage to person or property arising from the failure of a vessel to observe any rule of Article 1 of this chapter, shall be deemed to have been occasioned by the wilful default of the person in charge of the deck at the time, unless the circumstances of the case made a departure from the rule necessary.



######### 292.  
Losses caused by collision are to be borne as follows:

(a) If either party was exclusively in fault he shall bear his own loss, and he shall compensate the other for any loss he has sustained.

(b) If neither was in fault, the loss shall be borne by him upon whom it falls.

(c) If both were in fault, the loss shall be equally divided, unless it appears that there was a great disparity in fault, in which case the loss shall be equitably apportioned.

(d) If it can not be ascertained where the fault lies, the loss shall be equally divided.



######### 293.  
Where damage arises out of, or is caused directly and proximately by, the acts of an owner or operator, without the interposition of any external or independent agency which could not reasonably be foreseen, any owner or operator of any vessel engaged in the commercial transportation, storage in a vessel, or transfer of petroleum, fuel oil, or hazardous substances shall be absolutely liable without regard to fault for any property damage incurred by the state or by any county, city or district, or by any person, within the state, and for any damage or injury to the natural resources of the state, including, but not limited to, marine and wildlife resources, caused by the discharge or leakage of petroleum, fuel oil, or hazardous substances from such vessel into or upon the navigable waters of the state.

######### 294.  
(a) Any person responsible for natural gas, oil, drilling waste, or exploration, as defined in paragraph (4) of subdivision (g), shall be absolutely liable without regard to fault for any damages incurred by any injured party which arise out of, or are caused by, the discharge or leaking of natural gas, oil, or drilling waste into or onto marine waters, or by any exploration in or upon marine waters, from any of the following sources:

(1) Any offshore well or undersea site at which there is exploration for or extraction or recovery of natural gas or oil.

(2) Any offshore facility, oil rig, or oil platform at which there is exploration for, or extraction, recovery, processing, or storage of, natural gas or oil.

(3) Any vessel offshore in which natural gas, oil, or drilling waste is transported, processed, or stored.

(d) In determining whether a party is a responsible person under this section, the court shall consider the results of any chemical or other scientific tests  conducted to determine whether oil or other substances produced, discharged, or controlled by the defendant matches the oil or other substance which caused the damage to the injured party.  The defendant shall have the burden of producing the results of tests of samples of the substance which caused the injury and of substances for which the defendant is responsible, unless it is not possible to conduct the tests because of unavailability of samples to test or because the substance is not one for which reliable tests have been developed.  At the request of any party, any other party shall provide samples of oil or other substances within its possession or control for testing.

(e) The court may award reasonable costs of the suit, attorneys’ fees, and the costs of any necessary expert witnesses, to any  prevailing plaintiff. The court may award reasonable costs of the suit and attorneys’ fees to any prevailing defendant if the court finds that the plaintiff commenced or prosecuted the suit under this section in bad faith or solely for purposes of harassing the defendant.

(f) This section does not prohibit any person from bringing an action for damages caused by natural gas, oil, or drilling waste, or by exploration, under any other provision or principle of law, including, but not limited to, common law.

######### 411.  
This article applies only to work done on a vessel with an estimated cost of one hundred dollars ($100) or more.



######### 412.  
Notwithstanding Section 502, a repairperson has no lien on a vessel under this article for compensation for services rendered to the vessel, unless the repairperson has complied with this article.



######### 413.  
No repairperson shall commence work for compensation without specific authorization from the customer or his or her agent in accordance with all of the following requirements:

(a) The repairperson shall give to the customer either of the following:

(1) A written estimated price for labor and parts for a specific job.

(2) A written estimate of the maximum cost for a specific job which does not differentiate between labor and parts, but which shall not be exceeded by the actual cost of the job, including labor and parts.

No work shall be done or parts supplied in excess of, or different from, the original written estimate without the separate oral or written consent of the customer.  If the consent is oral, the repairperson shall make a notation on the work order and on the invoice of the date, time, name of person authorizing the additional work or change in work, and the telephone number called, if any, together with a specification of the additional parts and labor and the total additional cost.

(b) If it is necessary to disassemble a vessel or its component in order to prepare a written estimated price for required work, the repairperson shall first give the customer a written estimated price for the disassembly and reassembly.  The estimate shall also include the cost of parts and necessary labor to replace items such as gaskets, seals, and O rings that are normally destroyed by disassembling the component.  If the disassembling might prevent the restoration of the component to its former condition, the repairperson shall write that information on the work order containing the estimate before the work order is signed by the customer.

The repairperson shall inform the customer orally, and conspicuously in writing on the work order, of the maximum time it will take the repairperson to reassemble the vessel or its component if the customer elects not to proceed with the work.  The repairperson shall not charge the customer for more time than the specified maximum time if the customer elects not to proceed with the work.

After the disassembling has been performed, the repairperson shall prepare a written estimated price for labor and parts necessary for the requested work. Before performing the requested work, the repairperson shall obtain the customer’s authorization to either perform the work or to reassemble the vessel or its components.

(c) When the customer is unable to deliver the vessel to the repairperson during business hours, and the customer has requested the repairperson to take possession of the vessel for the purpose of performing work on the vessel or estimating the cost of the work, the repairperson shall not undertake work on the vessel for compensation unless the repairperson has done all of the following:

(1) The repairperson has prepared a work order stating the written estimated price for labor and parts necessary to perform the work.

(2) By telephone or otherwise, the customer has been given all of the information on the work order, and the customer has approved the work order.

(3) The customer has given oral or written authorization to the repairperson to make the repairs pursuant to the work order.

If the authorization is oral, the repairperson shall make, on both the work order and the invoice, a notation of the name of the customer, the date, the time, and the telephone number called, if any.



######### 414.  
Any repairperson who gives an original estimate in good faith, shall not be obligated to complete a job within the quoted or written estimated price if additional, unforeseen work is necessary to complete the job and the customer refuses to consent to payment for the cost of that additional work.

One copy of the invoice shall be given to the customer and one copy shall be retained by the repairperson.



######### 416.  
The invoice shall show the repairperson’s business name and address.

If the repairperson’s telephone number is on the invoice, it shall be the telephone number that appears in any advertisement or on an advertising sign, and shall be the same number as that listed for the repairperson’s firm name and address in the telephone directory, or on the telephone company records if the number is assigned to the repairperson subsequent to the publication of the telephone directory.



######### 417.  
Notwithstanding Section 413, upon authorization from the customer as to a specific job, a repairperson may work on a vessel on a time and materials basis.

##### ARTICLE 2. Liability, Generally [420 - 432]  

######### 420.  
A marine carrier is liable in like manner as an inland carrier, except for loss or injury caused by the perils of the sea or fire.



######### 421.  
The liability of a common carrier by sea is further regulated by acts of Congress.



######### 422.  
Perils of the sea are:

(a) Storms and waves.

(b) Rocks, shoals, and rapids.

(c) Other obstacles, though of human origin.

(d) Changes of climate.

(e) The confinement necessary at sea.

(f) Animals peculiar to the sea.

(g) All other dangers peculiar to the sea.



######### 423.  
A marine carrier shall not stow freight upon deck during the voyage, except where it is usual so to do, nor make any improper deviation from or delay in the voyage, nor do any other unnecessary act which would avoid an insurance in the usual form upon the freight.



######### 424.  
The owner of a vessel is bound to pay to the owner of her cargo the market value, at the time of arrival of the ship at the port of her destination, of that portion of her cargo which has been sold to enable the master to pay for the necessary repairs and supplies of the vessel.



######### 425.  
A carrier by water may, when in case of extreme peril it is necessary for the safety of the vessel or cargo, throw overboard, or otherwise sacrifice, any or all of the cargo or appurtenances of the vessel. Throwing property overboard for such purpose is called jettison, and the loss incurred is called a general average loss.



######### 426.  
So far as possible, a jettison shall begin with the most bulky and least valuable articles.



######### 427.  
A jettison can be made only by authority of the master of a vessel, except in case of his disability, or of an overruling necessity, when it may be made by any other person.



######### 428.  
The loss incurred by a jettison, when lawfully made, shall be borne in due proportion by all that part of the vessel, appurtenances, freightage, and cargo for the benefit of which the sacrifice is made, as well as by the owner of the thing sacrificed.



######### 429.  
The proportions in which a general average loss is to be borne shall be ascertained by an adjustment, in which the owner of each separate interest shall be charged with that proportion of the value of the thing lost which the value of his part of the property affected bears to the value of the whole. But an adjustment made at the end of the voyage, if valid there, is valid everywhere.



######### 430.  
In estimating values for the purpose of a general average, the vessel and appurtenances shall be valued as at the end of the voyage, the freightage at one-half the amount due on delivery, and the cargo as at the time and place of its discharge; adding, in each case, the amount made good by contribution.



######### 431.  
The owner of things stowed on deck, in case of their jettison, is entitled to the benefit of a general average contribution only if it is usual to stow such things on deck upon such a voyage.



######### 432.  
The law concerning jettison and general average is equally applicable to every other voluntary sacrifice of property on a vessel, or to an expense necessarily incurred, for the preservation of the vessel and cargo from extraordinary perils.








##### ARTICLE 3. Liability of Licensed Pilots for San Pedro Bay [440 - 444]  

######### 440.  
Pilots holding valid licenses for San Pedro Bay and its approaches and tributaries, their associations, employers, and others providing piloting services in San Pedro Bay are authorized to limit liability for the rendering and performance of those services by contracts or tariffs containing substantially the terms and provisions set forth in this article.



######### 441.  
The rates and charges for pilotage services do not include insurance covering the vessel or its owners, agents, charterers, or operators from the consequences of negligence of the pilot supplying the pilotage services, the pilot’s employer, or other employees of the pilot’s employer.



######### 442.  
Upon reasonable notice from the owners, agents, charterers, or operators, a pilot shall provide insurance covering the vessel, its owners, agents, charterers, or operators from the consequences of negligence of the pilot supplying the pilotage services, the pilot’s employer, or other employees of the pilot’s employer on a trip insurance basis with limits of coverage established by agreement between the pilot and the party requesting the insurance, the premium of which will be assessed in addition to the rates and charges for the pilotage services.



######### 443.  
The election of the owners, agents, charterers, or operators to use a pilot through whom trip insurance could have been obtained shall constitute a binding and irrevocable agreement on the part of the owners, agents, charterers, and operators to the terms and conditions set forth in Section 444.



######### 444.  
It shall be understood and agreed, and shall be the essence of an agreement under which services of the pilot are tendered to and are accepted by owners, agents, charterers, or operators, as follows:

(a) The vessel requesting pilotage services and its owners, agents, charterers, and operators covenant and agree not to assert a claim against the pilot, the pilot’s employer, or other employees of the pilot’s employer for damages, including any rights over, arising out of, or connected with, directly or indirectly, any damage, loss, or expense sustained by the vessel, its owners, agents, charterers, operators, or crew, and by any third parties, even though resulting in whole or in part from acts, omissions, or negligence of the pilot, the pilot’s employer, or other employees of the pilot’s employer. The vessel and its owners, agents, charterers, and operators further covenant and agree, subject to any limitation of liability to which they are entitled by reason of any contract, bill of lading, statute, or other provision of law in force, to indemnify and hold harmless the pilot, the pilot’s employer, and other employees of the pilot’s employer with respect to liability arising from any and all claims, suits, or actions, by whomsoever asserted, resulting in whole or in part from acts, omissions, or negligence of the pilot, the pilot’s employer, or other employees of the pilot’s employer. These covenants and agreements do not apply to liability and rights that may arise from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the pilot, the pilot’s employer, or other employees of the pilot’s employer.

(b) If any vessel on whose behalf pilotage services are requested is not owned by the person or entity ordering the services, that person or entity warrants its authority to bind the vessel and its owners, charterers, and operators to all the provisions contained in subdivision (a), and that person and entity agree to indemnify and hold harmless the pilot, the pilot’s employer, and other employees of the pilot’s employer with respect to all losses, damages, and expenses that may be suffered or incurred in consequence of the person or entity not having that authority.

(c) Pilotage services are voluntarily requested and are voluntarily rendered in reliance upon the terms specified in subdivisions (a) and (b).

(d) This article does not affect the rights of third parties against a vessel, its master, owners, agents, charterers, or operators, or a pilot, the pilot’s employer, or other employees of a pilot’s employer.

(e) This article does not preclude any pilot or pilot’s employer from entering into contracts with the owners, agents, charterers, or operators of a vessel that contain additional pilotage terms and conditions.

######### 449.3.  
The marine exchange shall cooperate fully with the administrator appointed pursuant to Section 8670.4 of the Government Code in the development and implementation of the vessel traffic service system required by Section 8670.21 of the Government Code.  Upon certification by the administrator that, pursuant to Section 8670.21, the Coast Guard has commenced operation of a fully federally funded vessel traffic service system for the Los Angeles/Long Beach harbor, the authorization contained in Section 445 for the marine exchange to operate a vessel traffic service is revoked.



######### 449.5.  
(a) Upon request by the administrator, the marine exchange shall submit a complete description and operational status report of the vessel traffic service.  After a public hearing, the administrator shall, in accordance with paragraph (8) of subdivision (f) of Section 8670.21 of the Government Code, determine whether the elements and operation of the vessel traffic service are consistent with the harbor safety plan for the Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors developed pursuant to Section 8670.23.1 of the Government Code and the standards of a statewide vessel traffic service plan or system developed pursuant to Section 8670.21 of the Government Code.

(b) If, pursuant to subdivision (a), the administrator determines that the vessel traffic service is inconsistent with the harbor safety plan for the Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors developed pursuant to Section 8670.23.1 of the Government Code and the standards of a statewide vessel traffic service plan or vessel traffic monitoring and communications system developed pursuant to Section 8670.21 of the Government Code, the administrator shall issue an order to the marine exchange which specifies modifications to the vessel traffic service to eliminate the inconsistencies.

#### CHAPTER 2. Civil Actions and Liens [450 - 509]  


##### ARTICLE 1. Bottomry [450 - 462]  

######### 450.  
Bottomry is a contract by which a vessel or its freightage is hypothecated as security for a loan, which is to be repaid only if the vessel survives a particular risk, voyage, or period.



######### 451.  
The owner of a vessel may hypothecate it or its freightage, upon bottomry, for any lawful purpose, and at any time and place.



######### 452.  
The master of a vessel may hypothecate it upon bottomry only for the purpose of procuring repairs or supplies which are necessary for accomplishing the objects of the voyage, or for securing the safety of the vessel.



######### 453.  
The master of a vessel can hypothecate it upon bottomry only when he can not otherwise relieve the necessities of the vessel, and is unable to reach adequate funds of the owner, or to obtain any funds upon the personal credit of the owner, and when previous communication with the owner is precluded by the urgent necessity of the case.



######### 454.  
The master of a vessel may hypothecate freightage upon bottomry, under the same circumstances as those which authorize an hypothecation of the vessel by him.



######### 455.  
Upon a contract of bottomry, the parties may lawfully stipulate for a rate of interest higher than that allowed by the law upon other contracts. But a competent court may reduce the rate stipulated when it appears unjustifiable and exorbitant.



######### 456.  
A lender upon a contract of bottomry, made by the master of a vessel, as such, may enforce the contract, though the circumstances necessary to authorize the master to hypothecate the vessel did not in fact exist, if, after due diligence and inquiry, the lender had reasonable grounds to believe, and did in good faith believe, in the existence of such circumstances.



######### 457.  
A stipulation in a contract of bottomry, imposing any liability for the loan independent of the maritime risks, is void.



######### 458.  
If there is a total loss of the thing hypothecated, from a risk to which the loan was subject, the lender upon bottomry can recover nothing; if a partial loss, he can recover only to the extent of the net value to the owner of the part saved.



######### 459.  
Unless it is otherwise expressly agreed, a bottomry loan becomes due immediately upon the termination of the risk, although a term of credit is specified in the contract.



######### 460.  
A bottomry lien is independent of possession, and is lost by omission to enforce it within a reasonable time.



######### 461.  
A bottomry lien, if created out of a real or apparent necessity, in good faith, is preferred to every other lien or claim upon the same thing, excepting only a lien for seamen’s wages, a subsequent lien of material-men for supplies or repairs indispensable to the safety of the vessel, and a subsequent lien for salvage.



######### 462.  
Of two or more bottomry liens on the same subject, the latter in date has preference, if created out of necessity.








##### ARTICLE 2. Respondentia [470 - 474]  

######### 470.  
Respondentia is a contract by which all or part of a cargo is hypothecated as security for a loan, the repayment of which is dependent on maritime risks.



######### 471.  
The owner of cargo may hypothecate it upon respondentia, at any time and place, and for any purpose.



######### 472.  
The master of a vessel may hypothecate its cargo upon respondentia only if all of the following conditions exist:

(a) He would be authorized to hypothecate the vessel and freightage.

(b) He is unable to borrow sufficient money on the vessel and freightage for repairs or supplies which are necessary for the successful accomplishment of the voyage.

(c) There is a reasonable prospect of benefiting the cargo.



######### 473.  
The owner of a vessel is bound to repay to the owner of its cargo all which the latter is compelled to pay in order to discharge a lien under a contract of respondentia made by the master.



######### 474.  
The provisions of sections 455 to 462 of this code apply equally to loans on respondentia.








##### ARTICLE 3. Actions Against Vessels [490 - 497]  

######### 490.  
Debts amounting to at least fifty dollars ($50), contracted for the benefit of vessels, are liens in the cases provided in Section 491.

Actions for any of the causes specified in Section 491 shall be brought against the owners by name, if known, but if not known, that fact shall be stated in the complaint, and the defendants shall be designated as unknown owners.  Other persons having a lien upon the vessel may be made defendants to the action, the nature and amount of such lien being stated in the complaint.



######### 491.  
All vessels are liable for:

(a) Services rendered on board at the request of, or under contract with, their respective owners, masters, agents, or consignees.

(b) Supplies furnished in this State for their use, at the request of their respective owners, masters, agents, or consignees.

(c) Work done or materials furnished in this State for their construction, repair, or equipment.

(d) Their wharfage and anchorage within this State.

(e) Breach of any contract for the transportation of persons or property between places within this State, made by their respective owners, masters, agents, or consignees.

(f) Injuries caused by them to persons or property, in this State.

Demands for these several causes constitute liens upon all vessels, have priority in the order enumerated, and have preference over all other demands; but such liens only continue in force for the period of one year from the time the cause of action accrued.



######### 492.  
The master of a vessel has a general lien, independent of possession, upon the vessel and freightage, for advances necessarily made or liability necessarily incurred by him for the benefit of the vessel, but he has no lien for wages.



######### 493.  
The mate and seamen of a vessel have a general lien, independent of possession, upon the vessel and freightage, for their wages, which is superior to every other lien.



######### 494.  
The cost of repairing or replacing any buoy or beacon which is maintained by authority of the United States Bureau of Lighthouses which may be misplaced, damaged, or destroyed by any vessel being made fast to it, is, when the cost is legally ascertained, a lien upon the vessel, and is recoverable against it and its owner.



######### 495.  
In any action brought pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the complaint shall designate the vessel by name, and shall be verified by the oath of the plaintiff, or someone on his behalf.

The summons and copy of the complaint shall be served on the owners if they can be found; otherwise, they may be served on the master, mate, or person having charge of the vessel.



######### 495.1.  
Notwithstanding Section 483.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the plaintiff, at the time of issuing the summons, or at any time afterwards, may have the vessel, with its tackle, appurtenances, appliances, furnishings, and furniture, attached as security for the satisfaction of any judgment that may be recovered in the action. A writ of attachment may be issued in the manner provided by Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 485.010) of Title 6.5 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure without the showing required by Section 485.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure.



######### 495.3.  
The writ shall be directed to the sheriff of the county within which the vessel lies, or the marshal of the court, and direct him or her to attach the vessel, with its tackle, appurtenances, appliances, furnishings, and furniture, and keep the same in his or her custody until discharged in due course of law.



######### 495.4.  
The sheriff or marshal to whom the writ is directed and delivered shall execute it without delay, and shall attach and keep in his or her custody the vessel, named therein, with its tackle, appurtenances, appliances, furnishings, and furniture, until discharged in due course of law; but the sheriff or marshal is not authorized by any such writ to interfere with the discharge of any merchandise on board of the vessel or with the removal of any trunks or other property of passengers, or of the captain, mate, seamen, steward, cook, or other persons employed on board.



######### 495.5.  
The owner, or the master agent, or consignee of the vessel, may, on behalf of the owner, appear and answer or plead to the action and may object to the undertaking filed on behalf of the plaintiff.



######### 495.6.  
After the attachment is levied, the owner, or the master, agent, or consignee of the vessel, may, in behalf of the owner, have the attachment discharged, upon filing with the court, subject to the provisions of Section 489.060 of the Code of Civil Procedure, an undertaking in an amount sufficient to satisfy the demand in the suit, besides costs.  Upon receiving notice of the filing of the undertaking with the court, the sheriff or marshal shall restore to the owner, or the master, agent, or consignee of the owner, the vessel attached.



######### 495.7.  
After the appearance in the action of the owner, the attachment may, on motion, also be discharged in the same manner, and on like terms and conditions, as attachments in other cases, subject to the provisions of Section 495.9.



######### 495.8.  
If the attachment is not discharged, and a judgment is recovered in the action in favor of the plaintiff, and an execution is issued thereon, the sheriff or marshal shall sell at public auction, after publication of notice pursuant to Section 6062 of the Government Code, the vessel, with its tackle, appurtenances, appliances, furnishings, and furniture, or such interest therein as may be necessary, and shall apply the proceeds of the sale as follows:

(a) When the action is brought for demands other than the wages of mariners, boatmen, and others employed in the service of the vessel sold, to the payment of the amount of those wages, as specified in the execution.

(b) To the payment of the judgment and costs, including his or her fees.

The sheriff or marshal shall pay any balance remaining to the owner, or to the master, agent, or consignee who may have appeared on behalf of the owner, or if there is no appearance, then into court, subject to the claim of any party or parties legally entitled thereto.



######### 495.9.  
Any mariner, boatman, or other person employed in the service of the vessel attached, who may wish to assert his or her claim for wages against the vessel, the attachments being issued for other demands than those wages, may file an affidavit of his or her claim, setting forth the amount and the particular service rendered, with the clerk of the court; and thereafter no attachment can be discharged upon filing an undertaking, unless the amount of the claim, or the amount determined as provided in Section 496, is covered thereby, in addition to the other requirements; and any execution issued against that vessel, upon judgment recovered thereafter shall direct the application of the proceeds of any sale:

(a) To the payment of the amount of such claims filed, or the amount determined, as provided in Section 496, which amount the clerk shall insert in the writ.  

(b) To the payment of the judgment and costs, and sheriff’s or marshal’s fees, and shall direct the payment of any balance to the owner, master, or consignee, who may have appeared in the action; but if no appearance by them is made therein, it shall direct a deposit of the balance in court.



######### 496.  
If the claim of the mariner, boatman, or other person filed with the clerk of the court, as provided in Section 495.9, is not contested within five days after notice of the filing thereof by the owner, master, agent, or consignee of the vessel against which the claim is filed, or by any creditor, it shall be deemed admitted; but if contested, the clerk shall indorse upon the affidavit thereof a statement that it is contested, and the grounds of the contest, and shall immediately thereafter order the matter to a single referee for his determination, or he may hear the proofs and determine the matter himself. The determination of the clerk or referee may be reviewed by a court in which the action is pending or a judge thereof immediately after such determination is made, and the judgment of the court or judge is final. On the review the court or judge may use the minutes of the evidence taken by the clerk or referee, or may take the evidence anew.



######### 497.  
The notice of sale published by the sheriff or marshal must contain a statement of the measurement and tonnage of the vessel and a general description of her condition.

The possessory vessel lien procedures described by the provisions of this article shall supersede any local ordinance and shall provide the exclusive means of enforcing these liens. Nothing in this article shall be construed as affecting any maritime lien cognizable under any federal law.



######### 502.  
(a) Except as provided in Article 1.5 (commencing with Section 410) of Chapter 1 of Division 3, every person has a lien dependent upon possession of the vessel for the compensation to which he or she is legally entitled for services rendered to or storage of any vessel subject to registration with the Department of Motor Vehicles.  The lien shall arise at the time a written statement of lien is sent to the registered owner of the vessel which specifies the charges for services or storage rendered and states that the vessel is subject to sale pursuant to the California Boater’s Lien Law.

(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), no lien provided by this section for storage or service provided upon the request of any person other than the legal owner as shown on the registration certificate of the vessel shall be valid against  the interest of the legal owner to the extent that the lien exceeds one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) unless the person performing the storage or service obtains the consent of the legal owner to the amount of the excess.  The legal owner may limit his or her consent to a specified dollar amount or period of time.  The lien claimant shall give actual notice in writing, prior to exceeding that amount, either by personal service or by registered mail to the legal and registered owner or owners as named and at the addresses as shown on the registration certificate, on a standard form provided by the department, containing a description of the storage or services, or both, a description and registration number of the vessel, the name of the registered owner or owners, the dollar amount or rate of the charges for the storage or services, and a statement in boldface type that, with respect to storage charges, consent of the legal owner shall be presumed unless the legal owner notifies the lien claimant within 15 days of receipt of the request for consent that he or she declines to consent to the storage.

(1) Applies to the department for an authorization to conduct a lien sale.

(2) Files an action on the claim in court.

(g) Nothing in this section shall impair any rights or remedies which are otherwise available to the lien claimant against the registered owner under any other provisions of law.



######### 503.  
(a) A lienholder shall apply to the department for the issuance of an authorization to conduct a lien sale pursuant to the provisions of this section for any vessel with a value determined to be over one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500).  A fee shall be charged by the department and may be recovered by the lienholder if a lien sale is conducted or if the vessel is redeemed.  The application shall be executed under penalty of perjury and shall include all of the following information:

(1) A description of the vessel, including make, hull identification number, and state of registration, to the extent available.

(2) The names and addresses of the registered and legal owners of the vessel, if ascertainable from the registration certificate within the vessel, and the name and address of any person whom the lienholder knows or reasonably should know claims a proprietary interest in the vessel.

(3) A statement of the amount of the lien and the facts which give rise to the lien.  The statement shall include, as a separate item, an estimate of any additional storage costs accruing pending the lien sale.

(b) Upon receipt of an application made pursuant to subdivision (a), the department shall within 15 days thereafter do the following:

(5) If a court action is filed, the declarant will be served by mail with legal process in the court proceedings at the address shown on the declaration of opposition and may appear to contest the claim.

(6) The person may be liable for court costs if a judgment is entered in favor of the lienholder.

(d) If the department receives the declaration of opposition in the time provided, the department shall notify the lienholder within 16 days of the receipt of the declaration of opposition that a lien sale shall not be conducted unless the lienholder files an action in court within 60 days of the notice.  A lien sale of the vessel shall not be conducted unless judgment is subsequently entered in favor of the lienholder or the declarant subsequently releases his or her interest in the vessel.

(e) Service of legal process on the declarant, with return receipt requested signed by the declarant or an authorized agent of the declarant at the address shown on the declaration of opposition, shall be effective.  Return of a declaration of opposition shall constitute consent by the declarant to service of legal process for the desired court hearing upon him or her in the foregoing manner.

(D) If the declaration of opposition is signed and returned, the lienholder will be allowed to sell the vessel only if he or she obtains a court judgment or if he or she obtains a subsequent release from the declarant.

(E) If a court action is filed, the declarant will be served by mail with legal process in the court proceedings at the address shown on the declaration of opposition and may appear to contest the claim.

(F) The person may be liable for court costs if a judgment is entered in favor of the lienholder.

(e) If the department receives the completed declaration of opposition within the time provided, the department shall notify the lienholder within 16 days that a lien sale shall not be conducted unless the lienholder files an action in court within 20 days of the notice and judgment is subsequently entered in favor of the lienholder or the declarant subsequently releases his or her interest in the vessel.

(f) Service on the declarant by mail with return receipt requested, signed by the declarant or an authorized agent of the declarant at the address shown on the declaration of opposition, shall be effective. Return of a declaration of opposition shall constitute consent by the declarant to service of legal process for the desired court hearing upon him or her in the foregoing manner. If the lienholder has attempted service upon the declarant by that method at the address shown on the declaration of opposition and the mail has been returned unclaimed, the lienholder may proceed with the sale.



######### 505.  
(a) A registered or legal owner of a vessel may release any interest in the vessel after the lien has arisen.  The release shall be dated when signed and a copy shall be given at the time the release is signed to the person releasing the interest.

(b) The release shall be in at least 12-point type and shall contain all of the following information in simple, nontechnical language:

(1) A description of the vessel, including the make, the identification number, and the state of registration, to the extent available.

(2) The names and addresses of the registered and legal owners of record with the department, to the extent available.

(3) A statement of the amount of the lien and the facts which give rise to the lien.

(5) A statement that (i) the person releasing the interest gives up any interest he or she may have in the vessel and (ii) he or she is giving the lienholder permission to sell the vessel.

(c) The release required by this section shall be filed with the department in connection with any transfer of interest in a vessel following a lien sale.



######### 505.5.  
(a) Whenever the lien upon any vessel is lost by reason of the loss of possession through trick, fraud, or device, the repossession of the vessel by the former lienholder claimant revives the lien, but a lien so revived is subordinate to any right, title, or interest of a person under a sale, transfer, encumbrance, lien, or other interest acquired or secured in good faith and for value between the time of the loss of possession and the time of repossession.

(b) It is a misdemeanor for a person to obtain possession of a vessel or any part of the vessel subject to a lien pursuant to the provisions of this chapter by trick, fraud, or device.

(c) It is a misdemeanor for a person claiming a lien on a vessel to knowingly violate this article.

(d) A person found guilty of a misdemeanor violation of subdivision (b) or (c) shall be subject to a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed six months, or both that fine and imprisonment.



######### 506.  
No lien sale shall be undertaken pursuant to Section 503 or 504 unless the vessel has been available for inspection at a location easily accessible to the public for at least one hour before the sale and is at the place of sale at the time and date specified on the notice of sale. Sealed bids shall not be accepted. The lienholder shall conduct the sale in a commercially reasonable manner.



######### 506.5.  
Within 10 days after the sale of any vessel pursuant to the provisions of Section 503 or 504, the legal or registered owner may redeem the vessel upon the payment of the amount of the lien, all costs and expenses of the lien, together with interest on that sum at the legal rate from the due date thereof until the repayment. If the vessel is not redeemed, all lien sale documents required by the department to effect transfer of title shall then be completed and delivered to the buyer.



######### 507.  
(a)  Except as provided in subdivision (b), at the time a lienholder applies to the department to conduct a sale under Section 504, the lienholder shall submit with the application a declaration by a licensed yacht and ship broker of the fair market value of the described vessel at a specific date within 30 days of that submission.  The opinion need not be based upon a marine survey, but shall be based on a physical inspection of the vessel.  No cause of action shall lie against the declarant on account of the opinion given.

(b) The declaration specified in subdivision (a) is not required if a public agency removes an abandoned vessel, or arranges, by contract, for the removal of the vessel, from a highway or from public or private property.

(1) For lien sale purposes, the public agency which removed the vessel, or arranged for the removal, shall determine if the estimated value of the vessel that has been ordered removed or stored is one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) or less.

(2) If the public agency fails or refuses to determine the estimated value of  the vessel within three days after the date of removal of the vessel, the lienholder or the lienholder’s agent shall determine, under penalty of perjury, if the estimated value of the vessel that has been ordered removed or stored is one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) or less.



######### 507.5.  
The proceeds of a vessel lien sale shall be disposed of as follows:

(a) The amount necessary to discharge the lien and the actual cost of selling the vessel shall be paid to the lienholder.  Actual cost of sale shall include any fees charged by the department, publication fees, postage and service of notices, whether incurred as a result of a sale or redemption by the registered or legal owner without a sale.  The actual cost of sale shall not exceed one hundred dollars ($100) for a vessel without a trailer and one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125) for a vessel with a trailer, exclusive of the charges of the department.

(b) The balance, if any, shall be forwarded to the department within 15 days of any sale.  Within 30 days thereafter, the department shall send notice of the receipt of the funds, if the amount thereof exceeds ten dollars ($10), to the legal and registered owners at the most current addresses shown in the department’s records.

(c) Any person claiming an interest in the vessel may file a claim with the department for any portion of the funds forwarded to the department pursuant to subdivision (b).  Upon determination of the department that the claimant is entitled to a portion of those funds, the department shall pay any entitled amount which does not exceed the balance of the funds remaining on deposit with the department that pertain to the vessel.  The department shall not honor any claim unless the claim has been filed within three years of the date the funds were received.  At the end of each fiscal year the department shall deposit in the Harbors and Watercraft Revolving Fund all funds held by it for which no claim was filed within the three-year period.



######### 508.  
A lien provided for in this article for repairs, labor, supplies, or materials for, or for storage or safekeeping of, a vessel may be assigned by written instrument accompanied by delivery of possession of the vessel subject to the lien, and the assignee may exercise the rights of a lienholder as provided in this article. A lienholder assigning a lien as authorized in this section shall at the time of assigning the lien give written notice of the assignment either by personal delivery or by certified mail, to the registered and legal owners of the vessel, indicating the name and address of the person to whom the lien is assigned.



######### 508.5.  
All forms required pursuant to this article shall be prescribed by the department. Language used in the notices and declarations shall be simple and nontechnical.



######### 509.  
No lien shall attach to any personal property in or on the vessel except that which is carried on the vessel for lifesaving, safety, mooring, and operating purposes. Personal property not subject to lien shall be given to the registered owner or the owner’s authorized agent upon demand.






#### CHAPTER 3. Wrecks and Salvage [510 - 571]  


##### ARTICLE 1. Wrecks and Wrecked Property [510 - 527]  

######### 510.  
The sheriff of each county shall give all possible aid and assistance to vessels stranded on its coast, and to the persons on board. He shall exert himself to save and preserve such persons, vessels, and their cargoes, and all goods and merchandise which may be cast by the sea upon the land, and to this end he may employ as many persons as he may think proper. All citizens shall aid the sheriff when required.



######### 511.  
Wrecked property may be kept or reclaimed at the time of the wreck by the owner, consignee, or other person entitled to possession; but if any person has a just claim for salvage and necessary expenses incurred in saving it, the claim shall be paid before the property can be reclaimed.



######### 512.  
The sheriff of any county in which any wrecked property is found, when no person entitled to possession appears, shall take possession of it in the name of the people, cause its value to be appraised by disinterested persons, and keep it in some safe place to answer the owner’s claims.



######### 513.  
If wrecked property is in a perishable state, the sheriff shall apply to the judge of the superior court, upon a verified petition, for an order authorizing the sheriff to sell it.  If the judge is satisfied that a sale of the property would be beneficial to the persons interested, he or she shall make the order applied for, and the property shall then be sold at public auction, as specified in the order.  The proceeds, deducting the expenses of salvage, storage, and sale as settled and allowed by the judge, shall be transmitted to the Treasurer for deposit in the General Fund.



######### 514.  
If, within 90 days after wrecked property is found, any person claims the property, or its proceeds, and establishes his  or her claim by evidence satisfactory to the judge of the superior court, the judge shall make an order directing the officer in whose possession the property or its proceeds may be, to deliver it to the claimant, upon the payment of a reasonable salvage and the necessary expenses of preservation.



######### 515.  
Before making the order, the judge shall require from the claimant a bond to the people to be approved by the judge and filed with the clerk of the court, in a penalty double the value of the property or proceeds.  The bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of all damages that may be recovered against the claimant or the claimant’s representatives, within three years after its date, by any person establishing title to the property or proceeds.



######### 516.  
If the bond becomes forfeited, the judge of the superior court, upon the application, supported by proof of the person entitled to its benefit shall make an order for its prosecution for such person’s benefit, and at his risk and expense.



######### 517.  
The rejection by the judge of any claim shall not preclude the claimant from maintaining an action against the officer for the recovery of the property or its proceeds. If the plaintiff prevails, there shall be deducted from the damages, in addition to salvage and expenses, all the defendant’s costs.



######### 518.  
If, within 60 days after saving wrecked property, no claimant of the property appears, or, if within 60 days after a claim, the salvage and expenses are not paid, or a suit for the recovery of the property is not commenced, the officer who has custody of the property may sell it at public auction and transmit the proceeds of the sale, after deducting salvage, storage, property tax liens, other liens, and other expenses, to the Treasurer for deposit in the General Fund. Deduction of salvage, storage, and other expenses shall not be made, unless the amount has been determined by the superior court of the county. A copy of the order, and the evidence in its support, shall be transmitted by the judge to the Controller.



######### 519.  
Public notice of every sale of wrecked property under the provisions of this article shall be published by the officer making the sale for at least two weeks in succession in one or more newspapers printed in the county, or if none is printed in the county, then by written or printed notices posted in three of the most public places in the county at least fifteen days previous to the sale. Every notice shall state the time and place of the sale and contain a particular description of the property to be sold.



######### 520.  
Every sheriff into whose possession any wrecked property comes, shall forthwith cause to be published for at least two weeks in succession, in one or more of the newspapers printed in this State, a notice directed to all persons interested. The notice shall contain a minute description of the property, and of every bale, box, case, piece, or parcel, and the marks, brands, letters, and figures on each. It shall state:

(a) Where the property then is and its actual condition.

(b) The name, if known, of the vessel from which it came.

(c) The names of its master and super-cargo.

(d) The place where the vessel then is, and its actual condition.



######### 521.  
The expense of publishing notices under the provisions of this article is a charge upon the property or proceeds to which it relates.



######### 522.  
(a) Any hulk, derelict, wreck, or parts of any ship, vessel, or other watercraft sunk, beached, or allowed to remain in an unseaworthy or dilapidated condition upon publicly owned submerged lands, salt marsh, or tidelands within the corporate limits of any municipal corporation or other public corporation or entity having jurisdiction or control over those lands, without its consent expressed by resolution of its legislative body, for a period longer than 30 days without a watchman or other person being maintained upon or near and in charge of the property, is abandoned property.

Thereafter, that municipal corporation or other public corporation or entity may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, take title to the abandoned property for purposes of abatement without satisfying any property tax lien on that property, and also may cause the property to be sold, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of in any manner it determines is expedient or convenient.  Any property tax lien on the abandoned property shall be satisfied within 30 days following the sale of the abandoned property by a municipal corporation or public entity.  Any sale in accordance with this section shall vest complete title in the purchaser who shall forthwith take steps to remove the property.  Any proceeds derived from the sale shall be transmitted to the Treasurer for deposit in the General Fund.

(b) However, if the owner of the property securely affixes to the property a notice in plain view setting forth the owner’s name and address and claim of ownership, together with the name and address of an agent or representative whom the owner may designate to act within the State of California if the owner does not reside in the state, and files a copy of the notice with the secretary of the municipal corporation or other public corporation or entity having jurisdiction or control over the lands at least 10 days prior to the removal, the municipal corporation or other public corporation or entity may not sell, destroy, or otherwise dispose of the property until the corporation or entity has first given the owner or the owner’s agent, at the address specified in the claim of ownership, 15 days’ notice to remove or cause the property to be removed, and then only if the property is not removed by the owner or the owner’s agent within that time or reasonable extensions of time as the corporation or entity may grant by resolution.  If a registration number appears on the watercraft, the municipal corporation or other public corporation or entity shall send the notice to the last registered owner and the disposition shall be handled as a lien sale under Section 504.

(c) Any municipal corporation or other public corporation may charge a fee to any person who is determined by that municipal or other public corporation to have caused property of a type described in subdivision (a) to become abandoned as described in that subdivision within its corporate limits, in an amount not to exceed the amount of that municipal or other public corporation’s actual and reasonable costs incurred pursuant to this section with respect to the abandoned property.



######### 523.  
(a) A peace officer, as described in Section 663, or a lifeguard or marine safety officer employed by a county, city, or district while engaged in the performance of official duties, may remove a vessel from, and, if necessary, store a vessel removed from, a public waterway under any of the following circumstances:

(1) When the vessel is left unattended and is moored, docked, beached, or made fast to land in a position that obstructs the normal movement of traffic or in a condition that creates a hazard to other vessels using the waterway, to public safety, or to the property of another.

(2) When the vessel is found upon a waterway and a report has previously been made that the vessel has been stolen or a complaint has been filed and a warrant thereon issued charging that the vessel has been embezzled.

(3) When the person or persons in charge of the vessel are by reason of physical injuries or illness incapacitated to an extent as to be unable to provide for its custody or removal.

(4) When an officer arrests a person operating or in control of the vessel for an alleged offense, and the officer is, by any provision of this code or other statute, required or permitted to take, and does take, the person arrested before a magistrate without unnecessary delay.

(5) When the vessel interferes with, or otherwise poses a danger to, navigation or to the public health, safety, or welfare.

(6) When the vessel poses a threat to adjacent wetlands, levies, sensitive habitat, any protected wildlife species, or water quality.

(7) When a vessel is found or operated upon a waterway with a registration expiration date in excess of one year before the date on which it is found or operated on the waterway.

(b) Costs incurred by a public entity pursuant to removal of vessels under subdivision (a) may be recovered through appropriate action in the courts of this state.

(c) (1) A peace officer, as described in Section 663, or marine safety officer employed by a city, county, or district, while engaged in the performance of official duties, may remove a vessel from, and, if necessary, store a vessel removed from, public property within the territorial limits in which the officer may act, in either of the following circumstances:

(A) When any vessel is found upon the public property and the officer has probable cause to believe the vessel was used in the commission of a crime.

(B) When a vessel is found upon public property and an officer has probable cause to believe that the vessel itself provides evidence that a crime was committed or the vessel contains evidence of a possible crime that was committed and the evidence cannot be easily removed from the vessel.

(2) Notwithstanding Section 3068 of the Civil Code, or Section 22851 of the Vehicle Code, no lien shall attach to a vessel removed under this subdivision unless it is determined that the vessel was used in the commission of a crime with the express or implied consent of the owner of the vessel.

(3) In any prosecution of a crime for which a vessel was removed and impounded under this subdivision, a court may order a person convicted of a crime involving the use of a vessel to pay the costs of towing and storage of the vessel and any administrative charges imposed in connection with the removal, impoundment, storage, or release of the vessel.

(d) For purposes of this section, “vessel” includes both the vessel and any trailer used by the operator to transport the vessel.



######### 524.  
(a) Any peace officer, as described in Section 663, may store any vessel removed from private property when the vessel is found on, or attached to, private property and a report has previously been made that the vessel has been stolen or a complaint has been filed and a warrant thereon issued charging that the vessel has been embezzled.

(b) Any peace officer, as described in Section 663, may, after a reasonable period of time, remove a vessel from private property if the vessel has been involved in, and left at, the scene of a boating accident and no owner is available to grant permission to remove the vessel.  This subdivision does not authorize the removal of a vessel if the owner has been contacted and has refused to grant permission to remove the vessel.  

(c) Nothing in this section is intended to expand the territorial jurisdiction of peace officers beyond the provisions of Sections 830.1 and 830.2 of the Penal Code.



######### 525.  
(a) Except for the urgent and immediate concern for the safety of those aboard a vessel, a person shall not abandon a vessel upon a public waterway or public or private property without the express or implied consent of the owner or person in lawful possession or control of the property.

(b) The abandonment of a vessel in a manner as provided in subdivision (a) is prima facie evidence that the last registered owner of record, not having notified the appropriate registration or documenting agency of any relinquishment of title or interest therein, is responsible for the abandonment and is thereby liable for the cost of the removal and disposition of the vessel.

(c) A violation of this section is an infraction and shall be punished by a fine of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000), nor more than three thousand dollars ($3,000). In addition, the court may order the defendant to pay to the agency that removes and disposes of the vessel the actual costs incurred by the agency for that removal and disposition.

(d) Fines imposed and collected pursuant to this section shall be allocated as follows:

(1) (A) Eighty percent of the moneys shall be deposited in the Abandoned Watercraft Abatement Fund, which is hereby created as a special fund. Moneys in the fund shall be used exclusively, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for grants to be awarded by the department to local agencies for the abatement, removal, storage, and disposal as public nuisances of any abandoned property as described in Section 522 or for the disposal of surrendered vessels as defined in Section 526.1, wrecked or dismantled vessels, or parts thereof, or any other partially submerged objects that pose a substantial hazard to navigation, from navigable waterways or adjacent public property, or private property with the landowner’s consent. These grants shall not be utilized for abatement, removal, storage, or disposal of commercial vessels.

(B) In evaluating a grant request submitted by a local agency pursuant to subparagraph (A), the department shall place great weight on the following two factors:

(i) The existence of an active local enforcement program to control and prevent the abandonment of watercraft within the local agency’s jurisdiction.

(ii) The existence of a submerged navigational hazard abatement plan at the local level that provides for the control or abatement of water hazards, including, but not limited to, abandoned watercraft, wrecked watercraft, hazardous floating debris, submerged vessels and objects, and abandoned piers and pilings.

(C) A grant awarded by the department pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be matched by a 10-percent contribution from the local agency receiving the grant.

(D) As a condition of receiving grant funding pursuant to this paragraph, a local agency shall report to the department data, as deemed appropriate by the department, regarding abandoned and surrendered vessels removed or anticipated for removal pursuant to this article.

(2) Twenty percent shall be allocated as set forth in Section 1463.001 of the Penal Code.

(e) The state shall not assume liability for any injuries or damages to a person or entity, public or private, connected to or resulting from the processing or disposal of a surrendered vessel, as defined in Section 526.1.

(f) The department may adopt rules and regulations for the purpose of administering this section.



######### 525.5.

(b) The recommendations shall be based on the expertise and data available to the department in relation to the existing abandoned watercraft abatement program administered by the department.

(c) The recommendations shall consider all of the following:

(1) The needs and desires of the recreational boating community in being able to properly and economically dispose of recreational vessels in lieu of abandoning them.

(2) Any environmental, economic, safety, or practical problems that need to be addressed before initiating a program to allow recreational vessels to be turned in to a public agency in lieu of abandonment, and the associated benefits of that program or any program that can prevent recreational vessels from being abandoned.

(3) An estimate of the number of vessels that may be turned in to local agencies in lieu of abandonment.

(d) (1) The director shall appoint an Abandoned Vessel Advisory Committee to assist the department in preparing recommendations.

(2) The membership of the committee shall include, but need not be limited to, representatives of all of the following:

(A) Boating law enforcement agencies.

(B) Entities that engage in the salvage or disposal of recreational vessels.

(C) Boat dealers.

(D) Boating, sailing, and yachting organizations.

(E) Owners and operators of public and private marina facilities.

(3) The members of the committee shall serve without compensation and may not be reimbursed by the state for expenses.

######### 526.  
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any wrecked property that is an unseaworthy derelict or hulk, abandoned property as described in Section 522, or property removed from a navigable waterway pursuant to Section 523 or 524 that is an unseaworthy derelict or hulk, may be sold or otherwise disposed of by the public agency that removed or caused the removal of the property pursuant to this section, subject to the following conditions, except a surrendered vessel, as defined in Section 526.1, may be disposed of immediately upon acceptance by a public agency and is not subject to the following conditions:

(1) The property has been appraised by disinterested persons, and has an estimated value of less than two thousand dollars ($2,000).

(7) A statement that the registered or legal owners or any other person known to have an interest in the property has the opportunity for a poststorage hearing before the public agency that removed, or caused the removal of, the property to determine the validity of the removal and storage if a request for a hearing is made in person or in writing to that public agency within 10 days from the date of notice; that if the registered or legal owners or any other person known to have an interest in the property disagree with the decision of the public agency, the decision may be reviewed pursuant to Section 11523 of the Government Code; and that during the time of the initial hearing, or during the time the decision is being reviewed pursuant to Section 11523 of the Government Code, the vessel in question shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of.

(c) (1) Any requested hearing shall be conducted within 48 hours of the time the request for a hearing is received by the public agency, excluding weekends and holidays. The public agency that removed the vehicle may authorize its own officers or employees to conduct the hearing, but the hearing officer shall not be the same person who directed the removal and storage of the property.

(2) The failure of either the registered or legal owners or any other person known to have an interest in the property to request or attend a scheduled hearing shall not affect the validity of the hearing.

######### 526.1.  
For purposes of this article, “surrendered vessel” means a recreational vessel that the verified titleholder has willingly surrendered to a willing public agency under both of the following conditions:

(a) The public agency has determined, in its sole discretion, that the vessel is in danger of being abandoned, and therefore has a likelihood of causing environmental degradation or becoming a hazard to navigation.

(b) The decision to accept a vessel is based solely on the potential of the vessel to likely be abandoned and cause environmental degradation or become a hazard to navigation.



######### 527.  
It is the intent of the Legislature that a sum of not more than one million dollars ($1,000,000) be appropriated from the Harbors and Watercraft Revolving Fund to the Abandoned Watercraft Abatement Fund for grants to local agencies pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) of Section 525 in each fiscal year and that grants from the Abandoned Watercraft Abatement Fund be matched by not less than a 10-percent contribution from the local agency receiving the grant.








##### ARTICLE 2. Salvage [530 - 534]  

######### 530.  
Sheriffs and all persons employed by them or aiding in the recovery and preservation of wrecked property, are entitled to a reasonable allowance as salvage for their services, and to all expenses incurred by them in their performance, out of the property saved. The officer having the custody of the property shall detain it until the allowance is paid or tendered. But the whole salvage claimed shall not exceed one-half of the value of the property or proceeds on which it is charged, and every agreement, order, or adjustment allowing a greater salvage is void, unless ordered and allowed by the superior court of the county.



######### 531.  
Every officer to whom an order for the delivery of wrecked property or the payment of its proceeds is directed, shall present to the claimant of the property or proceeds, a written statement of the claims for salvage and expenses. If the claimant refuses to allow that amount, it shall be adjusted as provided in this article.



######### 532.  
If, in any case, the amount of salvage and expenses is not settled by agreement, on the application of the owner or consignee of the property, or the master or supercargo having charge at the time of the wreck, or of a claimant having an order for the property, or of a person claiming salvage or expenses, the superior court of the county shall determine the amount of salvage and expenses in a summary way, either by itself hearing the allegations and proofs, or by referring the questions to three disinterested freeholders of the county, who shall have the same powers and shall proceed in the same manner as referees in civil actions. Their decisions as to the whole amount and as to the sums to be paid to each person interested shall be entered as the judgment of the court.



######### 533.  
The fees and expenses of the contest shall be paid by the person upon whose application it was had, and are a charge on the property saved. Each referee is entitled to such per diem and expenses as the court may order.



######### 534.

(A) A criminal complaint may be filed against him or her for operating a mechanically propelled vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or under the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug.

(B) He or she has a right to refuse chemical testing.

(C) An officer has the authority to seek a search warrant compelling the arrested person to submit a blood sample as described in paragraph (16) of subdivision (a) of Section 1524 of the Penal Code.

(D) He or she does not have the right to have an attorney present before stating whether he or she will submit to the chemical testing, before deciding which chemical test or tests to take, or during the administration of the chemical test or tests chosen.

(c) If the person is lawfully arrested for operating a mechanically propelled vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device under the influence of an alcoholic beverage and submits to the chemical testing, the person has the choice of whether the chemical test shall be of his or her blood or breath and the person shall be advised by the arresting officer that he or she has that choice. If the person arrested either is incapable, or states that he or she is incapable, of completing the chosen test, the person shall submit to the remaining test. If a blood or breath test, or both, are unavailable, then subdivision (n) applies.

(d) If the person is lawfully arrested for operating a mechanically propelled vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device under the influence of any drug or the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug and submits to the chemical testing, the person has the choice of whether the chemical test shall be of his or her blood, breath, or urine, and the officer shall advise the person that he or she has that choice.

(e) A person who chooses to submit to a breath test may also be requested to submit to a blood or urine test if the arresting officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person was operating a mechanically propelled vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device under the influence of any drug, or the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug, and if the arresting officer has a clear indication that a blood or urine test will reveal evidence of the person being under the influence. The arresting officer shall state in his or her report the facts upon which that belief and that clear indication are based. The person shall have the choice of submitting to and completing a blood or urine test, and shall be advised by the arresting officer that he or she is requested to submit to an additional test, and that he or she may choose a test of either blood or urine. If the person arrested is either incapable, or states that he or she is incapable, of completing either chosen chemical test, the person shall submit to and complete the other remaining chemical test.

(f) (1) A person who chooses to submit to a breath test shall be advised before or after the breath test that the breath-testing equipment does not retain any sample of the breath, and that no breath sample will be available after the breath test which could be analyzed later by the person or any other person.

(2) The person shall also be advised that, because no breath sample is retained, the person will be given an opportunity to provide a blood or urine sample that will be retained at no cost to the person so that there will be something retained that may be subsequently analyzed for the alcoholic content of the person’s blood. If the person completes a breath test and wishes to provide a blood or urine sample to be retained, the sample shall be collected and retained in the same manner as if the person had chosen a blood or urine test initially.

(3) The person shall also be advised that the blood or urine sample may be tested by either party in any criminal prosecution. The failure of either party to perform this chemical test shall place no duty upon the opposing party to perform the chemical test nor affect the admissibility of any other evidence of the drug or alcoholic content of the blood of the person arrested.

(g) If the person is lawfully arrested for any offense allegedly committed in violation of subdivision (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) of Section 655, and because of the need for medical treatment, the person is first transported to a medical facility where it is not feasible to administer a particular chemical test of, or to obtain a particular sample of, the person’s blood, breath, or urine, the person has the choice of submitting to those chemical tests that are available at the facility to which that person has been transported. In this event, the arresting officer shall advise the person of those chemical tests that are available at the medical facility, and that the person’s choice is limited to those chemical tests that are available.

(h) Any person who is unconscious or otherwise in a condition rendering him or her incapable of refusal may be subjected to chemical testing of his or her blood, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the drug or alcoholic content of the blood, whether or not the person is advised of the information specified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b).

(i) Any person who is afflicted with hemophilia is exempt from the blood test provided for in this section.

(j) Any person who is afflicted with a heart condition and is using an anticoagulant under the direction of a licensed physician and surgeon is exempt from the blood test provided for in this section.

(k) A person lawfully arrested for any offense allegedly committed while the person was operating a mechanically propelled vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device in violation of subdivision (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) of Section 655 may request the arresting officer to have a chemical test made of his or her blood or breath for the purpose of determining the drug or alcoholic content of the blood and, if so requested, the arresting officer shall have the chemical test performed.

(a) Every owner of an undocumented vessel numbered under this code is liable and responsible for the death of or injury to person or property resulting from negligence in the operation of such vessel, in the business of the owner or otherwise, by any person using and operating the same with the permission, express or implied, of the owner, and the negligence of such person shall be imputed to the owner for all purposes of civil damage.  It shall be presumed that such vessel is being operated with the knowledge and consent of the owner if at the time of the injury, death or damage it is under the control of his or her spouse, father, mother, brother, sister, son, daughter, or other immediate member of the owner’s family.  Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to relieve any person from any liability which he would otherwise have, but nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to authorize or permit any recovery in excess of injury or damage actually incurred.

(b) The liability of an owner for imputed negligence imposed by this section and not arising through the relationship of principal and agent or master and servant is limited to the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for the death of or injury to one person in any one accident and, subject to the limit as to one person, is limited to the amount of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) for the death of or injury to more than one person in any one accident and is limited to the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for damage to property of others in any one accident.

(c) In any action against an owner on account of imputed negligence as imposed by this section the operator of the vessel whose negligence is imputed to the owner shall be made a party defendant if personal service of process can be had upon the operator within this State.  Upon recovery of judgment, recourse shall first be had against the property of the operator so served.

Payments aggregating the full sum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) shall extinguish all liability of the owner for death or personal injury arising out of the accident which exists by reason of imputed negligence, pursuant to this section, and did not arise through the negligence of the owner nor through the relationship of principal and agent or master and servant.

(g) If a vessel is sold under a contract of conditional sale whereby the title to such vessel remains in the vendor, such vendor or his assignee shall not be deemed an owner within the provisions of this section relating to imputed negligence, but the vendee or his assignee shall be deemed the owner notwithstanding the terms of such contract, until the vendor or his assignee retakes possession of the vessel.

(a) Each county of the state is entitled to receive state financial aid for boating safety and enforcement programs on waters under its jurisdiction as provided in this section.  A boating safety and enforcement program, as used in this section, includes search and rescue operations, recovery of drowned bodies, enforcement of state and local measures for regulation of boating activities, inspection of vessels, and supervision of organized water events.

(b) A public agency within a county and the Department of Parks and Recreation are entitled to receive aid for boating safety and enforcement programs on waters under their jurisdiction through the county in which it lies, and that aid shall be counted as aid to the county; except that aid provided under subdivision (h) for boating safety and enforcement programs of the Department of Parks and Recreation for waters under its jurisdiction shall not be counted as aid to a county.

(c) (1) Of the funds appropriated for boating safety and enforcement programs pursuant to Section 85.2, the department shall adopt and utilize a formula that first allocates funds to counties so that no county receives less than the amount it was allocated in the 1996–97 fiscal year, unless the county’s program is reduced, or the county does not meet the eligibility requirements of this section.  If the total amount of money in the Harbors and Watercraft Revolving Fund is less than the amount available for the 1996–97 fiscal year, the funds allocated to each county shall be reduced in proportion to the reduction in the overall fund relative to the 1996–97 fiscal year.

(2) Second, from funds remaining, the department shall allocate funds to eligible counties which have submitted a grant application pursuant to subdivision (i) but which do not receive an allocation pursuant to paragraph (1).

(e) The department shall not allocate funds to any county or a public agency within a county unless the department receives a resolution adopted annually by the board of supervisors authorizing the county to participate in the program and certifying that the county will expend for boating safety programs during that year not less than an amount equal to 100 percent of the amount received by the county from personal property taxes on vessels.  The money allocated to a county pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be used only for boating safety and enforcement programs, as specified in subdivision (a), that are conducted in that county.

(f) Any county that receives an allocation of funds pursuant to subdivision (c) shall submit a report to the department on or before 60 days after the end of the fiscal year that provides all of the following:

(1) The purpose for which funds received in the immediately preceding fiscal year were spent.

(2) The total amount expended on boating safety and enforcement programs in the immediately preceding fiscal year.

(3) All pertinent boating safety and enforcement and accident statistics from the immediately preceding fiscal year.

Budgets for those programs shall be estimated for each fiscal year and adjustments shall be made thereto for the previous year in accordance with the actual boat entry count as it becomes available multiplied by the boat entry unit cost factor.  The amount thus determined shall be available to the Department of Parks and Recreation from the Harbors and Watercraft Revolving Fund.

(i) Entities or agencies desiring aid under this section shall submit grant applications to the department at least six months prior to the period for which aid is required.  Grant applications shall be in the form and contain the information that the department may require.

Thereupon the magistrate shall fix the amount of bail which in the magistrate’s judgment, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1275 of the Penal Code, will be reasonable and sufficient for the appearance of the defendant and shall indorse upon the notice a statement signed by the defendant in the form set forth in Section 815a of the Penal Code.  The defendant may, prior to the date upon which the defendant promised to appear in court, deposit with the magistrate the amount of bail thus set.

If an applicant presents a valid operator’s license issued pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Motorboat Act of 1940 (Title 46, U.S.C., Section 526f) or the federal act of May 10, 1956, (Title 46, U.S.C. 390–390g), the department may issue an operator’s license without requiring an examination.



######### 765.  
The examination may include a test of the applicant’s knowledge of safety rules, an actual demonstration of his ability to exercise ordinary and reasonable control in operating a vessel, and his mental and physical fitness. The examination may also include an inspection of the for-hire vessel.



######### 766.  
Upon completion of the examination, the department may, with or without hearing, issue the operator’s license or issue it for the partial exercise only of the privilege sought, and may attach to the exercise of the rights granted by the license such terms and conditions as, in its judgment, the public safety requires.

If the department refuses to grant an operator’s license the proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, and in all cases the department shall have all the powers granted therein.



######### 767.  
An operator’s license issued by the department pursuant to the provisions of this article shall be valid for five years from the date of issuance or renewal and may be renewed every five years thereafter unless suspended or revoked pursuant to Section 768. The department may adopt rules and regulations establishing the requirments for renewal of any license issued under this article, including therein requirements for acuity of vision, color sense and general physical condition.



######### 768.  
(a) The department may suspend or revoke any license issued pursuant to this article on a finding that the licensee has violated any of the provisions in this chapter, or has violated any of the regulations promulgated pursuant to carrying out the provisions of this article.  The department may also revoke any license issued pursuant to this article upon any of the grounds which authorize the refusal to issue a license.

If the department suspends or revokes an operator’s license, the proceedings shall be in accordance with Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, and in all cases the department shall have all the powers granted therein.

(b) The period of time for suspension during which the person may not apply for his license shall be determined by the department.  The department shall not renew an operator’s license which has been revoked until the expiration of one year after the date of such revocation unless the revocation was for a cause which has been removed.



######### 769.  
The department shall be responsible for administering the licensing of operators of for-hire vessels and for enforcing the provisions of this article, and in this connection may inspect for-hire vessels as defined in Section 760 on waters of this state other than those waters which have been declared to be navigable by agencies of the federal government.



######### 770.  
The division shall make rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this article, including adopting a schedule to establish reasonable fees that cover the division’s cost for exams, licensing, renewals, and other services provided by the division under this article.



######### 771.  
It is unlawful and constitutes a misdemeanor for any person to violate, or to fail to comply with, any provision of this article after April 1, 1964.



######### 772.  
The authority and power granted to the department in this article shall not be construed to conflict with or diminish in any manner the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission over for-hire vessels or common carriers, as those terms are defined in the Public Utilities Code.








##### ARTICLE 4. Charter Boat Safety [773 - 774.4]  

######### 773.  
The Legislature finds and declares that the charter boat industry operates in the public interest by providing jobs, nutritious food, education, recreation, and joy for Californians and their visitors. The appreciation of whales in their natural habitat has increased enormously in recent years, along with the number of off-shore excursions embarking from California harbors, carrying people from all over the world close to whales that pass along our shore. Because Pacific Ocean conditions, especially in winter, may suddenly turn rough or even hazardous, the public health and safety, as well as the continued vitality of the charter boat industry, is best served by appropriate safety regulation.



######### 773.1.  
This article shall be known and may be cited as the Charter Boat Safety Act of 1983.



######### 773.2.  
As used in this article, the following definitions shall apply:

(a) “For-hire vessel” means a for-hire vessel as defined in Section 4661 of the Public Utilities Code, irrespective of the number of passengers carried.

(b) “Charter boat” means a for-hire vessel operating on navigable water of the state in the coastal zone, as defined in Section 30103 of the Public Resources Code, whether or not the vessel is licensed by the state. However, “charter boat” does not include any boat operating solely within a harbor, as defined in Section 34, or any boat licensed for point-to-point service while operating within the scope of that license.

(c) “Operator” means a person owning, controlling, operating, or managing a for-hire vessel.

(d) “Charterer” means a person who receives compensation for contracting with an operator to transport three or more passengers.

(e) “Coast Guard” means the United States Coast Guard.

(f) “Life preserver” means a life preserver approved and certified by the Coast Guard and capable of providing at least 90 percent of factory-rated flotation capacity.

(g) “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, for-profit corporation, nonprofit corporation, limited liability company, company, association, joint stock association, trustee, receiver, assignee, or other similar entity or representative.



######### 773.3.  
No person shall take or offer to take seven or more passengers on a charter boat unless the vessel is licensed by the United States Coast Guard.



######### 773.4.  
(a) No operator or charterer shall prevent any person from complying with, or direct any person to violate, any provision of this article, or direct the captain to get underway over the captain’s objection that the condition of the vessel, or the weather, or a combination of both, makes the trip inadvisable.  

(b) It shall be a full and complete defense to a charge of violating this section that, given the then-existing conditions of the vessel and the weather, the captain’s or other person’s compliance, however obtained, did not violate and would not have violated any provision of this article or any regulation of the Coast Guard, and was and would have been consistent with all safety precautions and procedures recommended by the Coast Guard.

(c) As used in this section:

(1) “Direct” means to coerce or attempt to coerce by threat of loss of employment or charter earnings or, if by an operator but not a charterer, to make a demand in violation of this section under circumstances in which it would be reasonable for the captain or other person to believe that failure to comply could lead to the loss of his or her employment or charter earnings.

(2) “Captain” means the individual responsible for the operation of the vessel while underway.



######### 773.5.  
The operator of a charter boat, or the operator’s employee or agent, shall require each passenger to don a life preserver under any of the following conditions:

(a) When conditions of rough weather or heavy seas pose a threat to the vessel or its passengers.

(b) When there is a casualty to the vessel including, but not limited to, any of the following:

(1) Loss of watertight integrity.

(2) Loss of propulsion or steering in close proximity to a shoal or shore.

(3) Fire at sea.

(4) When under tow.

(c) When crossing or navigating the bar or shoal at or near the entrance of any California harbor where weather conditions, surface current, breaking seas, or severely reduced visibility, cause an increase in the possibility of a sudden emergency that might prevent passengers from donning life preservers before entering the water.

(d) As used in this section:

(1) “An increase in the possibility” means a decrease in the certainty of a reasonably prudent operator that normal operation of the charter boat would avoid any sudden mishap.

(2) “Normal operation” means operation without resort to emergency procedures or other extraordinary measures to maintain course.



######### 773.6.  
An operator, or the operator’s employee or agent, who directs the passengers to the life preservers while announcing that the passengers are required for their safety to don them shall be deemed to have complied with Section 773.5, if the operator, or the operator’s employee or agent, or the operator’s employee at least once instructs any passenger who fails to don a life preserver to do so, and if the life preservers are unwrapped, ready to be donned, and stowed in a conveniently accessible place.



######### 773.7.  
The operator, or the operator’s employee or agent, of a charter boat, prior to getting underway, shall orient each passenger concerning emergency procedures. A public announcement shall be made at the beginning of each trip to afford all passengers knowledge of the stowage location of life preservers, a demonstration of the proper method of donning and adjusting life preservers, the type and location of all lifesaving devices carried on the vessel, and the location of and contents of the emergency check-off list as prescribed in 46 C.F.R. 185.25-1. This public announcement shall be identified as a safety briefing in compliance with state law so as to differentiate it from a general information announcement.



######### 773.8.  
(a) A charterer or operator who organizes charter boat trips shall inform each adult passenger as soon as practicable after the passenger contracts or pays for passage or boards the charter boat, whichever occurs first, that life jackets will be provided at the adult passenger’s request. Adult and minor passengers shall be informed that life jackets are required to be worn at the direction of the operator or the operator’s employee or agent.

(b) When leaving or returning to port, the operator shall use reasonable care in securing or causing to be secured objects which may cause injury to passengers.



######### 774.  
(a) Every charterer and every charter boat operator shall include in all advertising for any charter trips in the coastal zone, as defined in Section 30103 of the Public Resources Code, the statement that for the public safety all personal flotation devices carried aboard these United States Coast Guard Certificated Vessels are inspected and approved by the United States Coast Guard.

(b) Any operator or charterer who violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not less than fifty dollars ($50) and not more than one hundred dollars ($100) for each violation.  The action shall be brought in the manner specified in Section 17206 of the Business and Professions Code.



######### 774.1.  
No operator of a for-hire vessel shall leave or enter Morro Bay after being directed by the harbormaster of the harbor not to do so because of the condition of the weather, the sea, the vessel, or a combination thereof.



######### 774.2.  
The operation of Section 655, 773.5, 773.7, or 774.1 or subdivision (b) of Section 773.8 shall be suspended if the Coast Guard or other appropriate federal agency has adopted and is enforcing a substantially similar regulation which conflicts with those sections.



######### 774.3.  
(a) Except as provided in Section 774, violation of any provision of this article is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than six months in the county jail, or a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both the fine and imprisonment.

(b) Any operator who violates any provision of this article shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for each violation.  The action shall be brought in the manner specified in Section 17206 of the Business and Professions Code.

(c) Any violation of this article may be enjoined by the manner specified in Section 17203 of the Business and Professions Code and a violation of an injunction may be punished to the extent provided in Section 17207 of the Business and Professions Code.



######### 774.4.  
(a) This article does not impose any mandatory duties upon any public entity to monitor sea or weather conditions or to warn or prevent vessels from leaving or entering a harbor entrance during unsafe conditions.

(b) No public entity or employee thereof is liable for any injury which results from any act, or omission to act, prohibiting an operator for a for-hire vessel from leaving or entering a harbor.

#### DIVISION 4. MASTERS, CREWS AND CARGOES [790 - 876]  


##### CHAPTER 1. Scope of Division [790- 790.]  

######### 790.  
The provisions of this Division shall not be construed to apply to the extent to which they are not within the legislative power of this state, except in so far as they may be permitted to apply under the provisions of the Constitution of the United States or the acts of Congress.







##### CHAPTER 2. Ship Masters and Cargoes [800 - 821]  

######### 800.  
The master of a vessel is appointed by and holds his appointment at the pleasure of the owner.



######### 801.  
The master of a vessel shall be always on board when it is entering or leaving a port, harbor, or river unless the vessel is in charge of a mate who possesses a master’s license.



######### 802.  
On entering or leaving a port, harbor, or river, the master of a vessel, the navigation of which is not in charge of a pilot, licensed for that port, harbor, or river, shall take a pilot if one offers himself. While the pilot is on board the navigation of the vessel devolves on him.



######### 803.  
The master of a vessel may enforce the obedience of the mate and seamen to his lawful commands by confinement and other reasonable corporal punishment; but the master is responsible for the abuse of his power.



######### 804.  
The master of a vessel may confine any person on board, during a voyage, for wilful disobedience to his lawful commands.



######### 805.  
If, during a voyage, the vessel’s supplies fail, the master, with the advice of the officers, may compel persons who have private supplies on board to surrender them for the common want, or payment of, or on giving security for, their value.



######### 806.  
The master of a vessel shall not abandon it during the voyage, without the advice of the other officers.



######### 807.  
The master of a vessel, upon abandoning it, shall carry with him, so far as it is in his power, the money and the most valuable of the goods on board, under penalty of being personally responsible. If the articles thus taken are lost from causes beyond his control, he is exonerated from liability.



######### 808.  
The master of a vessel, who engages for a common profit on the cargo, shall not trade on his own account, and if he does, he shall account to his employer for all profits thus made by him.



######### 809.  
The master of a vessel shall use great care and diligence in the performance of his duties, and he is responsible for all damage occasioned by his negligence.



######### 810.  
The master of a vessel is a general agent for its owner in all matters concerning the vessel.



######### 811.  
The master of a vessel has authority to borrow money on the credit of its owner, if it is necessary to enable him to complete the voyage, and if neither the owner nor his proper agent for such matters can be consulted without injurious delay.



######### 812.  
During a voyage, the master of a vessel is a general agent for each of the owners of the cargo, and has authority to do whatever they might do for the preservation of their respective interests, but he can not sell or hypothecate the cargo, except in the cases mentioned in this chapter.



######### 813.  
The master of a vessel may procure all its necessary repairs and supplies, may engage cargo and passengers for carriage, and, in a foreign port, may enter into a charter-party. His contracts for these purposes bind the owner to the full amount of the value of the vessel and freightage.



######### 814.  
The master of a vessel may hypothecate the vessel, freightage, and cargo, and sell part of the cargo, in the cases prescribed by the articles on bottomry and respondentia, and in no others, except that the master may also sell the cargo, or any part of it, short of the port of destination, if it is found to be of such perishable nature, or in such damaged condition that if left on board or reshipped it would be entirely lost or seriously endanger the interests of its owners.



######### 815.  
When a vessel, whether foreign or domestic, is seriously damaged, or the voyage is otherwise broken up beyond the possibility of pursuing it, the master, in case of necessity, may sell the vessel without instructions from the owners, unless by the earliest use of ordinary means of communication he can inform the owners and await their instructions.



######### 816.  
The master of a vessel may sell the cargo if the voyage is broken up beyond the possibility of pursuing it, and no other vessel can be obtained to carry it to its destination, and the sale is otherwise absolutely necessary.



######### 817.  
The master of a vessel in case of its capture may engage to pay a ransom for it in money or in part of the cargo, and his engagement will bind the vessel, freightage, and cargo.



######### 818.  
The power of the master of a vessel to bind its owner, or the owners of the cargo, ceases upon the abandonment of the vessel and freightage to insurers.



######### 819.  
Unless otherwise expressly agreed, or unless the contracting parties give exclusive credit to the owner, the master of a vessel is personally liable upon his contracts relative to the vessel, even when the owner is also liable.



######### 820.  
The master of a vessel is liable to third persons for the acts or negligence of persons employed in its navigation, whether appointed by him or not, to the same extent as the owner of the vessel; but neither the owner nor the master of a vessel is responsible for the negligence of a pilot whom he is bound by law to employ, unless an option is allowed between pilots, some of whom are competent, or unless he is required only to pay compensation to the pilot, but is not required to use his services.



######### 821.  
The owner of a vessel is bound to pay to the owner of the cargo, at the time of arrival of the vessel at the port of the destination, the market value of that portion of the cargo which has been sold to enable the master to pay for the necessary repairs and supplies of the vessel.







##### CHAPTER 2.5. Ship’s Managers [830 - 834]  

######### 830.  
The general agent for the owners, in respect to the care of a ship and freight, is called the manager. If he is a part owner, he is also called the managing owner.



######### 831.  
Unless otherwise directed, it is the duty of the manager of a vessel to provide for its complete seaworthiness; to take care of it in port; and to see that it is provided with necessary papers, with a proper master, mate, and crew, and supplies of provisions and stores.



######### 832.  
A managing owner is presumed to be without right to compensation for his own services.



######### 833.  
A manager may make contracts requisite for the performance of his duties. He may enter into charter parties, make contracts for carriage, settle for freightage, and adjust averages.



######### 834.  
Without special authority a manager shall not borrow money or give up the lien for freightage, or purchase a cargo, or bind the owners of the vessel to an insurance.







##### CHAPTER 3. Mates and Seamen [860 - 876]  

######### 860.  
The mate is the officer next in rank to the master, and in case of the master’s disability the mate becomes the master. By so doing he does not lose any of his rights as mate.



######### 861.  
All persons employed in the navigation of a vessel, or upon a voyage, other than the master and mate, are seamen within the provisions of this code.



######### 862.  
The mate and seamen of a vessel are engaged by the master, and may be discharged by him at any period of the voyage for wilful and persistent disobedience or gross disqualification, but they can not be discharged for other reasons before the termination of the voyage.



######### 863.  
A mate or seaman is not bound to go to sea in a vessel that is not seaworthy. If there is reasonable doubt of its seaworthiness he may refuse to proceed until a proper survey has been had.



######### 864.  
A seaman can not by agreement be deprived of his lien upon the vessel, or of any remedy for the recovery of his wages to which he would otherwise have been entitled. Any agreement, by which he consents to abandon his right to wages in case of the loss of the vessel, or to abandon any right he may have or may obtain in the nature of salvage is void.



######### 865.  
A seaman can not, by special agreement, impair any of his rights, or add to any of his obligations, as defined by law, unless he fully understands the effect of the agreement and receives for it a fair compensation.



######### 866.  
Except as otherwise provided by law, the wages of seamen are due when, and so far only as, freightage is earned, unless the loss of freightage is due to the fault of the owner or master.



######### 867.  
The right of a mate or seaman to wages and provisions begins either from the time he begins work, or from the time specified in the agreement for his beginning work, or from his presence on board, whichever first happens.



######### 868.  
If a voyage is broken up before departure of the vessel, the seamen shall be paid for the time they have served, and they may retain for their indemnity any advances they may have received.



######### 869.  
When a mate or seaman is wrongfully discharged, or is driven to leave the vessel by the cruelty of the master on the voyage, it is then ended with respect to him, and he may recover his full wages.



######### 870.

(b) A pilot who holds a state license for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun shall arrange to have available, upon advance written notice, trip insurance, with coverage limits of thirty-six million dollars ($36,000,000), naming as insureds the pilot, any organization of pilots to which the pilot belongs, and their officers and employees, and insuring the named insureds against any civil claim, demand, suit, or action by whomsoever asserted, arising out of, or relating to, directly or indirectly, acts or omissions of the insureds in connection with the provision of pilotage service, except willful misconduct.

(c) Every vessel, owner, operator, or demise or bareboat charterer hiring a pilot with a state license for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun shall either defend, indemnify, and hold harmless pilots pursuant to paragraph (1), or alternatively, notify pilots of an intent to pay for trip insurance pursuant to paragraph (2).  If a vessel or its owner, operator, or demise or bareboat charterer does not provide written notice pursuant to paragraph (2) of an intent to exercise the trip insurance option, then the vessel and its owner, operator, and demise or bareboat charterer will be deemed to have elected the obligation to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless pilots pursuant to paragraph (1).

(1) (A) Except for a vessel electing trip insurance pursuant to paragraph (2), a vessel subject to this subdivision, and its owner, operator, demise or bareboat charterer, and agent shall not assert any claim, demand, suit, or action against the pilot, any organization of pilots to which the pilot belongs, and their officers and employees, for damages, including any rights over, arising out of, or connected with, directly or indirectly, any damage, loss, or expense sustained by the vessel, its owners, agents, demise or bareboat charterers, operators, or crew, or by any third parties, even if the damage results, in whole, or in part, from any act, omission, or negligence of the pilot, any organization of pilots to which the pilot belongs, and their officers and employees.

The obligation to indemnify under this paragraph shall not apply to the extent that it causes the amount recoverable from a vessel, its owner, operator, or demise or bareboat charterer to exceed the limits of liability to which it is entitled under any bill of lading, charter party, contract of affreightment, or provision of law.

(C) The prohibition on claims by vessels, owners, operators, demise or bareboat charterers, and agents imposed by subparagraph (A) and the obligation to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the pilot imposed by subparagraph (B) shall not apply in cases of willful misconduct by a pilot, any organization of pilots to which the pilot belongs, and their officers and employees.

#### DIVISION 6. HARBORS AND PORTS [1690 - 3980]  

#### PART 1. PORT INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING [1690 - 1719]  

#### CHAPTER 1. Findings and Definitions [1690 - 1699]  


##### ARTICLE 1. Legislative Findings [1690- 1690.]  

######### 1690.  
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) The state has a compelling interest in the success of its ports and harbors because they provide significant economic benefit to the state in terms of jobs, personal income, business revenue, and taxes. It is the policy of the state that, because of that compelling interest, legislation in this area is a matter of statewide concern and is necessary to develop the harbors and ports of this state for the benefit of the people.

(b) Ports and harbors are the vital interface between water and land transportation for trade with the Pacific Rim countries and other trade. In this respect, the specific management of the state’s ports and harbors by specific harbor and port districts established pursuant to Division 8 (commencing with Section 5800) are of equal statewide concern and importance as the management of granted lands held in trust for the state by a local port or harbor district.

(c) Historically, California’s ports and harbors have been self-supporting. Most port and harbor districts do not levy or expend funds generated by local taxes, as most of their operations are funded directly through fees and other revenue the ports generate from their users or tenants, in addition to occasional state and federal grants.

(d) The report of the California Transportation Commission entitled “Improving Access to California’s Ports,” dated February 1990, found that eight hundred ninety-seven million dollars ($897,000,000) is needed for port access transportation projects. By December 2014, the “California Freight Mobility Plan” report of the Department of Transportation identified a comprehensive list of freight projects in the state, including port access transportation projects, with an estimated total cost of one hundred thirty-eight billion dollars ($138,000,000,000).

(e) In addition to port access transportation projects, there is a need for new harbor facilities and infrastructure investments that will enhance California’s competitiveness for international cargoes, grow employment, yield significant economic development, increase state and local tax revenues, and reduce impacts to environmental quality from goods movement.

(f) Because of limited revenues from port operations, shrinking federal and state funding and the increasing demand for those limited funds, ports and harbors are no longer able to finance projects of this magnitude without new funding mechanisms. One such mechanism that can be used to finance port and harbor development projects is the enhanced infrastructure financing district.

(g) It is the intent of the Legislature to assist in the reduction of local borrowing costs, help accelerate the construction, repair, and maintenance of port capital improvements, and promote greater use of existing and new financial instruments and mechanisms.

(h) It is further the intent of the Legislature to assert the state’s plenary power over the financing of port and harbor infrastructure by harbor agencies as matters of statewide concern and to authorize the use of tax increment financing, as provided in Chapter 2.99 (commencing with Section 53398.50) of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code, to support investment of tax revenues in port and harbor infrastructure.

(i) The Legislature empowers local legislative bodies with specific and exclusive delegated authority to manage the state’s ports and harbors by legislative grant and by establishment of special districts pursuant to this code. In addition, the Legislature delegates to public financing authorities the power to establish seaport infrastructure financing districts for the purpose of leveraging investment in support of the statewide interest in improving port and harbor infrastructure.

##### CHAPTER 3. Seaport Infrastructure Financing Districts  [1710 - 1719]  

######### 1710.  
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) In addition to the findings and declarations in Section 53398.50 of the Government Code, the ability to capture property tax increment revenues to finance needed seaport and harbor infrastructure projects will provide direct benefits to the state. When harbor agencies are better funded to further the objectives of the state, its seaports and harbors, and the public trust and enjoyment of those trust lands by the people of the state, local economies and the local environment will also be improved.

(b) A seaport or harbor or its operation frequently generates large local tax benefits directly as a result of the possessory interest taxes paid on the value of leased port and harbor real property.

(c) The tax increment increases in possessory interest taxes that will result from the improvement of seaport and harbor infrastructure should be captured, whenever possible, and reinvested to support the state’s significant interest in the successful operation of its seaports and harbors.

(d) The unique nature of the state’s public seaports and harbors, including the nature of the statewide interest in their operations, requires special rules if these ports and harbors are to be allowed to participate in a seaport infrastructure financing district.

(e) The seaport infrastructure financing district is specifically developed to include publicly owned property, to improve that public property, and to achieve the public goals of improving the state’s waterborne commerce, enhancing economic prosperity, and financing the costs of environmental mitigation and improvement.

(f) This chapter is intended to maintain and enforce the state’s retained rights, statewide interests, obligations and sovereign duties in its seaports, harbors, and tidelands, including protecting these same assets from local control or excise, while simultaneously creating an opportunity for public financing authorities to participate in facilitating investment in the state’s public seaport infrastructure and finance projects that will have the anticipated effect of not only providing statewide benefits, but also local benefits such as boosting local employment, local secondary economic development, local environmental improvement, and increased local tax revenues.



######### 1711.  
As used in this chapter, “public financing authority” has the same meaning as provided in Section 53398.51 of the Government Code.



######### 1712.  
When designated by the legislative body pursuant to Section 53398.62 of the Government Code, the harbor agency shall prepare a proposed infrastructure financing plan, as provided in Section 53398.63 of the Government Code, for a seaport infrastructure financing district covering a port or harbor infrastructure.



######### 1713.  
(a) Upon receipt of a resolution from the public financing authority promulgated under subdivision (a) of Section 53398.80.5 of the Government Code, the harbor agency shall have 60 days to consider the proposal. During this time, the harbor agency’s governing body shall act at a duly noticed meeting to either vote to give preliminary approval of the proposal, subject to the provisions of this section, or disapprove the proposal and return it to the public financing authority.

All bonds herein authorized, which shall have been duly sold and delivered as herein provided, shall constitute valid and legally binding general obligations of the State of California, and the full faith and credit of the State of California is hereby pledged for the punctual payment of both principal and interest thereof. There is hereby appropriated from any available moneys in the account established in the Harbor Bond Sinking Fund pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 3918.5, or if such moneys are insufficient, then from the General Fund of the State of California, such sum annually as will be necessary to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds issued and sold at the instance of the authority pursuant to the provisions of this part, as such principal and interest become due and payable.

There shall be collected annually in the same manner and at the same time as other state revenue is collected such a sum, in addition to the ordinary revenues of the State, as shall be required to pay the principal and interest on said bonds as herein provided, and it is hereby made the duty of all officers charged by law with any duty in regard to the collections of said revenue, to do and perform each and every act which shall be necessary to collect such additional sum.  



######### 3911.  
In determining the dates of maturity of the bonds, and the amount thereof to mature at each date of maturity, the committee shall be guided, so far as it may deem to be practicable, by the amounts of the revenue estimated to accrue to the Harbor Bond Sinking Fund. The committee shall fix and determine the dates and amounts of such maturities in such manner that, together with the dates and amounts of interest payments on the bonds, they shall coincide, as nearly as it may deem to be practicable, with the dates and amounts of such estimated revenue.



######### 3912.  
The rate of interest to be borne by the bonds need not be uniform for all bonds of the same issue, series or division and shall be the rate or rates fixed and determined by the committee in a resolution adopted prior to the sale of the bonds or as specified in the bid accepted by the State Treasurer if the bonds are sold on the basis of the bidder naming the interest rate or rates, in which event the State Treasurer shall fix such rate or rates in conformity with the bid of the successful bidder.

If the State Treasurer determines that the bids received are not satisfactory as to price or responsibility of the bidders, the State Treasurer may reject all bids received. The Treasurer may from time to time, by public announcement at the place and time fixed for the sale, continue such sale, as to the whole of the bonds offered, or any part thereof offered, at such time and place as he may select. If the bonds are offered for sale upon sealed bids, then each bid shall be in writing and signed by the bidder and sealed, and shall be accompanied by the deposit of a certified check or cashier’s check for one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the par value of the bonds so offered for sale, but not exceeding one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), drawn on a bank or trust company authorized to transact and transacting business in the State of California, payable to the Treasurer of the State of California, such deposit not to bear interest. The deposit of each unsuccessful bidder shall be returned to him immediately upon the nonacceptance of his bid, and the deposit of the successful bidder shall immediately upon the acceptance of his bid become and be the property of the State of California and be placed in the State Treasury to the credit of the Fifth San Francisco Seawall Fund with respect to bonds issued at the instance of the authority and to the credit of the Small Craft Harbor Bond Fund with respect to bonds issued at the instance of the commission, and shall be credited to the successful purchaser upon the purchase price of the bonds bid for in case such purchase price is paid in full by him within the time mutually agreed upon between the successful bidder and the Treasurer. If the purchase price is not so paid, the successful bidder shall have no right in and to the bonds or by reason of such bid, or to the recovery of the deposit accompanying the bid, or to any allowance or credit by reason of such deposit unless it shall appear that the bonds would not be validly issued if delivered to the purchaser in the form and manner proposed. In case the purchase price is not so paid, the bonds so sold but not paid for shall be resold by the State Treasurer upon notice as provided in case of original sale.

Temporary or interim bonds, certificates, or receipts of any denomination whatever and with or without coupons attached thereto, to be signed by the State Treasurer, may be issued and delivered until the definitive bonds are executed and available for delivery.  Signature of the State Treasurer may be by facsimile or signature stamp.

In addition to the notice last above provided for, the State Treasurer may give such further notice as he may deem advisable.

Whenever bonds are sold at the instance of the authority out of the first money realized from their sale, there shall be redeposited in the revolving fund such sums as have been expended for the above purposes with respect to such bonds, which may be used for the same purpose and repaid in the same manner whenever additional sales are made. Whenever bonds are sold at the instance of the commission, out of the first money realized from their sale, there shall be redeposited in the revolving fund such sums as have been expended for the above purposes with respect to such bonds, which may be used for the same purpose and repaid in the same manner whenever additional sales are made. Whenever all the bonds authorized by this part have been sold, the amount of the appropriation made by this section shall revert to the unappropriated surplus in the General Fund.

If there is no newspaper located in the county, then publication shall be made in a newspaper published in an adjoining county and notices shall be posted in three public places in the proper counties for four successive weeks. The notices shall specify the proposed location of the wharf or chute and shall also state the time and place at which the application will be made.



######### 4004.  
When any lands sought to be appropriated and used for a wharf or chute are not owned by the applicant or if a right of way and use has not been obtained by agreement, these facts and the particular description of the land shall be set forth in the petition of the applicant, and a copy of the notice of application shall be served on the owner by the sheriff of the county, at least ten days prior to the day set for the hearing. The sheriff’s official return is conclusive evidence of service.

If the proof is satisfactory, the board shall hear the allegations of the petition and any objections to the granting of the application, and proofs in support of each. If from the proofs it appears that the public good or convenience will be promoted thereby, the board may grant to the applicant the right to erect or construct a wharf or chute as prayed for, and to take tolls for its use for the term of twenty years.

The grant carries with it the right to have unencumbered and unobstructed the land and water on each side of the wharf or chute from high-water mark to navigable water, for a distance of one hundred and fifty feet, for the convenience of landing, loading, and unloading vessels, but for no other purpose.



######### 4009.

######### 4011.  
The orders granting authority, and agreements, contracts, deeds, and decrees of courts granting the right of way and other use of lands, shall be filed and recorded in the office of the recorder of the county in which the wharf or chute is situated, and constitutes the franchise of the applicant. The fees of the recorder, as also the fees of the clerk, sheriff, and other officers, for services rendered, shall be paid by the applicant.



######### 4012.  
The board shall annually fix the rate of tolls or wharfage for the use of the wharf or chute, to produce an income of not less than fifteen nor more than twenty-five per cent per annum on the fair cash value of the wharf or chute, and on the cost of its repair and maintenance, exclusive of the amount paid for the license required by this chapter. The value, and the cost of repair and maintenance shall be fixed by the board when fixing the rates of tolls or wharfage, by hearing evidence and examining the assessment rolls of the county. When fixed, the rates shall be furnished the owner, and a printed or written copy conspicuously posted on the wharf or chute.



######### 4013.  
When the wharf or chute is completed and the tolls or wharfage fixed, the owner is entitled to a license to take tolls for the term of one year. The license shall be issued by the county auditor on the payment of such license tax as the board may fix, which tax, except for the first year, shall not be more than ten per cent of the gross receipts for tolls or wharfage for the previous year. The fee shall be paid to the county treasury for general road purposes.



######### 4014.  
An owner or keeper of a wharf or chute who takes toll or wharfage for its use forfeits the sum of twenty-five dollars, and is liable for all damage occasioned, if he fails to keep it in good repair, or if it is unsafe or dangerous. The penalty may be recovered by order of the board which granted the authority, for the use of the general road fund of the county.

The lands of the State situated in the city of San Francisco, and those otherwise disposed of or situated within the limits of any incorporated town or city of this State, are excluded from the provisions of this chapter. The municipal authorities of any incorporated city or town other than San Francisco may grant authority to construct wharves or chutes as is herein provided for the boards of supervisors.



######### 4017.  
A board of supervisors of a county may grant any railroad corporation authority to construct a wharf on or in front of any lands owned by it bordering on any navigable bay, inlet, lake, creek, slough or arm of the sea situated in or bounding the county, with a license to take tolls for its use for the term of the corporate existence of the railroad corporation, not exceeding fifty years, whenever the board finds the use of the wharf or pier is necessary to the exercise of the franchise of the railroad corporation for terminal purposes. The authority may be granted without offering it for sale.

Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to limit the powers of a board to grant the right to railroad corporations to build and construct for terminal purposes on and in front of any land owned by it a wharf of the width necessary for the carrying on of the business of such railroad at such terminal.  The wharf may extend to the length that may be desirable, not exceeding one thousand feet, if it does not prevent navigation.

There is excluded from the operation of this section any and all territory and property under the jurisdiction or control of any incorporated city or town or any board of State harbor commissioners.

All of the provisions of this chapter not in conflict with anything in this section contained are applicable to all proceedings under this section.

Pursuant to this article, the Stockton Port District may also create an additional bonded debt up to but not in excess of 3 percent of the assessed value of all taxable real and personal property within the district.



######### 6350.1.  
This bonded indebtedness may be created solely for the purpose of providing funds for the acquisition or construction of revenue-producing harbor improvements of a self-liquidating character.



######### 6350.2.  
All bonds issued pursuant to this article shall be authorized by ordinance passed by two-thirds of all of the members of the board concurred in by ordinance of the Stockton City Council. But an election need not be held within the district and it is unnecessary to secure the approval of the electors within the district for the issuance of bonds for the purposes and within the limitations of this article.



######### 6350.3.  
The bonds shall be payable within 30 years from their date and shall mature serially at such times as may be fixed by the board, but the earliest maturity of the principal of the bonds shall be fixed at a date not more than 10 years from the date of issue.



######### 6350.4.  
The bonds may be issued in such denominations as the board determines, except that no bond shall be of a denomination less than one hundred dollars ($100) nor of a greater denomination than one thousand dollars ($1,000).

The bonds shall be payable on the day and at the place or places fixed in such bonds, with interest at the rate specified in the bonds, which rate shall not be in excess of 7 percent per annum of the face amount, payable annually or semiannually.

The board may provide for redemption of the bonds before maturity at prices and upon terms and conditions determined by it.  A bond shall not be subject to call or redemption prior to maturity unless it contains a recital on its face to that effect.



######### 6350.5.  
If any officer whose signature or countersignature appears on the bonds or coupons ceases to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds to the purchaser, his signature or countersignature is nevertheless as valid and sufficient for all purposes as if he had remained in office.

The bonds may be issued and sold by the board for not less than their par value and accrued interest to date of delivery, at such time and under such conditions as may be designated by the board.

The proceeds shall be placed in the treasury of the district to the credit of the proper improvement fund and applied exclusively to the objects and purposes mentioned in the ordinance.



######### 6350.6.  
The form of the bonds shall be prescribed by the board and they shall be signed by the officer or officers that the board designates.

The income and revenue derived or to be realized from the harbor improvement acquired or to be acquired from the proceeds of the bonds shall be deposited in a special fund and kept separate and apart from all other revenues of the district. It shall be applied, firstly, to the creation of an interest fund, herein designated as “interest fund,” for the payment of the annual interest due or to become due upon the bonds during the next ensuing fiscal year and before the time for the fixing of the next general tax levy in the county in which the district is located.



######### 6350.8.  
The special fund shall be applied, secondly, to the creation of a sinking fund, herein designated as “sinking fund,” to provide for the payment of the principal of the bonds at or before their maturity date or dates.



######### 6350.9.  
Any additional revenues over and above the amounts required to be deposited in the interest fund and the sinking fund, may be deposited in an operation fund, herein designated as “operation fund,” to be applied to the costs of operation and maintenance, including reasonable repairs and depreciation, of the particular revenue-producing harbor improvement acquired by the issuance and sale of the bonds.



######### 6351.  
Surplus revenues in the operation fund may be deposited either in the interest fund or the sinking fund, but money allocated to the interest fund or the sinking fund shall not be transferred to any other fund or used for any other purpose than the payment of the bonds and the interest thereon so long as the bonds are outstanding.



######### 6351.5.  
The board, in and by the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the bonds, shall hypothecate and allocate all of the revenues to be realized from the revenue-producing harbor improvement to be acquired or constructed from the proceeds of the bonds to the payment of both principal and interest.

The allocation and hypothecation is irrevocable until all bonds and the accrued interest thereon are paid.

The allocation and hypothecation shall be made in each case for the exclusive benefit of the bonds to be issued for the purpose of acquiring or constructing the particular revenue-producing harbor improvement, and as additional security for the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds.

But the allocation and hypothecation do not constitute the exclusive source of payment.  The bonds constitute general obligations of the district and both principal and interest may be paid from any money or sources of revenue of any kind, including taxes, on hand and available for that purpose.



######### 6352.  
Whenever the revenues of the district are, or in the opinion of the board will be insufficient to provide for the payment in full of the principal or interest on the bonds, the board may, and if the revenues in the interest fund are insufficient to meet the next ensuing fiscal year’s interest on the bonds issued and then outstanding or if the moneys in the sinking fund are insufficient to pay or provide for the payment of any bonds maturing during the next ensuing fiscal year, it shall cause a tax to be levied and collected, upon all of the taxable property in the district, sufficient to meet all sums coming due for principal and interest on the bonds during the next ensuing fiscal year and before the time for fixing the next general tax levy in the county in which the district is located.

The tax shall be levied and collected annually in the manner provided by Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 6360) of this part, and shall be in addition to all other taxes authorized to be levied and collected.  When collected, the tax shall not be used for any purpose other than the payment of the bonds and the accruing interest thereon.



######### 6353.  
The Legislature hereby finds and declares that because of the unique, complex problems existing with respect to the Stockton Port District, as a large inland port district, it is necessary that special legislation be enacted to authorize additional, limited financing provisions for said port district, and that a general law cannot be made applicable.









##### ARTICLE 3. County and Municipal Bonds [6355- 6355.]  

######### 6355.  
Whenever, upon the creation of a district any municipality therein or any county in which the district is located which has theretofore authorized or incurred a bonded indebtedness for any work or improvement for which the district may incur a bonded debt pursuant to this part, and such municipality or such county thereafter sells such bonds or any portion thereof, the proceeds of the sale may, upon the order of the appropriate board of supervisors or city council, be paid by the custodian into the treasury of the district and shall be applied by the board, exclusively to the purposes and objects for which the bonds were authorized by the municipal corporation or the county issuing them.

Any additional revenues over and above the amounts required to be deposited in the interest fund and the sinking fund, may be deposited in an operation fund, herein designated as “operation fund,” to be applied to the costs of operation and maintenance, including reasonable repairs, depreciation and capital improvements of the particular revenue-producing harbor improvement acquired, constructed, improved or extended by the issuance and sale of the bonds.



######### 6939.14.  
Surplus revenues in the operation fund may be deposited either in the interest fund or any reserve fund created to secure any bonds or in the sinking fund, but money allocated to the interest fund or the sinking fund shall not be transferred to any other fund or used for any other purpose than the payment of the bonds and the interest thereon so long as the bonds are outstanding.



######### 6939.15.  
The board, in and by the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the bonds, shall hypothecate and allocate all of the revenues to be realized from the revenue-producing harbor improvement to be acquired or constructed, improved or extended from the proceeds of the bonds to the payment of both principal and interest.

The allocation and hypothecation is irrevocable until all bonds and the accrued interest thereon are paid.

The allocation and hypothecation shall be made in each case for the exclusive benefit of the bonds to be issued for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, improving or extending the particular revenue-producing harbor improvement, and as additional security for the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds.

But the allocation and hypothecation do not constitute the exclusive source of payment.  The bonds constitute general obligations of the district and both principal and interest may be paid from any money or sources of revenue of any kind, including taxes, on hand and available for that purpose.



######### 6939.16.  
Whenever the revenues of the district are, or in the opinion of the board will be insufficient to provide for the payment in full of the principal or interest on the bonds, the board may, and if the revenues in the interest fund are insufficient to meet the next ensuing fiscal year’s interest on the bonds issued and then outstanding or if the moneys in the sinking fund are insufficient to pay or provide for the payment of any bonds maturing during the next ensuing fiscal year, or if any reserve fund has been drawn upon and not replenished it shall cause a tax to be levied and collected, upon all of the taxable property in the district, sufficient to meet all sums coming due for principal and interest on the bonds during the next ensuing fiscal year and before the time for fixing the next general tax levy in the county in which the district is located or to replenish such reserve fund.

The tax shall be levied and collected annually in the manner provided by Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 6940) of this part, and shall be in addition to all other taxes authorized to be levied and collected.  When collected, the tax shall not be used for any purpose other than the payment of the bonds and the accruing interest thereon or the replenishment of such reserve fund.



######### 6939.17.  
The Legislature hereby finds and declares that because of the unique, complex problems existing with respect to the Sacramento-Yolo Port District, as a large inland port district, it is necessary that special legislation be enacted to authorize additional, limited financing provisions for said port district, and that a general law cannot be made applicable.
