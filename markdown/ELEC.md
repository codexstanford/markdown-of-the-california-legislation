(A) A presumption exists that the signature on the identification envelope, signature verification statement, unsigned identification envelope statement, or provisional ballot envelope is the voter’s signature.

(B) An exact match is not required for an elections official to determine that a voter’s signature is valid. The fact that signatures share similar characteristics is sufficient to determine that a signature is valid.

(C) Except as provided in subparagraph (D), the elections official shall consider explanations for discrepancies between signatures that are specified in regulations promulgated by the Secretary of State. For purposes of this subparagraph, explanations include a variation in signature style over time and the haste with which a signature is written.

(D) When comparing signatures, an elections official shall not review or consider a voter’s party preference, race, or ethnicity.

(E) The elections official may consider characteristics of the written signature that are specified in regulations promulgated by the Secretary of State. For purposes of this subparagraph, characteristics include the slant of the signature, letter formation, and whether the signature is printed or written in cursive.

(F) The elections official may use facsimiles of voters’ signatures, provided that the method of preparing and displaying the facsimiles complies with the law.

(G) In comparing signatures pursuant to this section, an elections official may use signature verification technology. If signature verification technology determines that the signatures do not compare, the signature is subject to the additional procedures described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (c).

(H) The variation of a signature caused by the substitution of initials for the first or middle name, or both, is not grounds for the elections official to determine that the signatures do not compare.

(I) A signature made using a mark such as an “X”, or made by a signature stamp, shall be presumed valid and shall be accepted if the signature meets the requirements of Section 354.5.

(b) If upon conducting the comparison of signatures pursuant to subdivision (a) the elections official determines that the signatures compare, the elections official shall deposit the ballot, still in the identification envelope, in a ballot container in the elections official’s office.

(c) (1) If upon conducting the comparison of signatures pursuant to subdivision (a) the elections official determines that the signature possesses multiple, significant, and obvious differing characteristics when compared to all signatures in the voter’s registration record, the signature is subject to the additional procedures described in paragraph (2).

(2) If the elections official makes the determination described in paragraph (1), the signature shall be rejected only if two additional elections officials each find beyond a reasonable doubt that the signature differs in multiple, significant, and obvious respects from all signatures in the voter’s registration record. If the officials determine that the signatures do not compare, the identification envelope shall not be opened and the ballot shall not be counted. The elections official shall write the cause of the rejection on the face of the identification envelope only after completing the procedures described in subdivision (d).

(d) (1) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (D), on or before the next business day after a determination that a voter’s signature does not compare pursuant to subdivision (c), but not later than eight days prior to the certification of the election, the elections official shall send by first-class mail notice to the voter of the opportunity to verify the voter’s signature no later than 5 p.m. two days prior to the certification of the election. The notice shall include a return envelope, with postage paid, for the voter to return a signature verification statement.

(B) Unless required pursuant to Section 3026, the elections official may send additional written notices to a voter identified pursuant to subdivision (c), and may also notify the voter in person, by telephone or email, or by other means of the opportunity to verify the voter’s signature.

(C) Unless required pursuant to Section 3026, the elections official may use any information in a county’s election management system, or otherwise in the election official’s possession, for the purpose of notifying the voter of the opportunity to verify the voter’s signature.

(D) If it is impracticable under the circumstances for the elections official to send the notice described in subparagraph (A) on or before the next business day, including in the event of technological failure, the elections official shall send the notice as soon as practicable, but not later than eight days prior to the certification of the election.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a military or overseas voter who qualifies pursuant to this chapter may, by facsimile transmission, register to vote and apply for a ballot pursuant to this section or a vote by mail ballot.

|

(b) Notwithstanding the voter’s waiver of the right to a secret ballot, each elections official shall adopt appropriate procedures to protect the secrecy of ballots returned by facsimile transmission.

(c) Upon receipt of a ballot returned by facsimile transmission, the elections official shall determine the voter’s eligibility to vote by comparing the signature on the return information with the signature on the voter’s affidavit of registration or any signature permitted for comparison under Section 3019. The ballot shall be duplicated and all materials preserved according to procedures set forth in this code.

(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a military or overseas voter who is permitted to return their ballot by facsimile transmission is, nonetheless, encouraged to return their ballot by mail or in person if possible. A military or overseas voter should return a ballot by facsimile transmission only if doing so is necessary for the ballot to be received before the close of polls on election day.



######### 3107.  
When the application is received by an elections official, other than a county elections official, the elections official receiving it shall, after the election, transmit it to the county elections official who, if the application is not subject to rejection, shall file the original. If an application is rejected, it shall be returned to the applicant with the reason for rejection endorsed on it, together with a new blank application.



######### 3108.  
(a) A military or overseas voter who is qualified pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 300 may apply in person to the voter’s elections official for permission to register after the closing date of registration under the following conditions:

(1) The military or overseas voter is released from service after the closing date of registration for an election, returns to the county of his or her residence, and is not a registered voter. To register, the elector shall furnish documentary proof that he or she was released from service after the closing date of registration for the election.

(2) The military or overseas voter is required to move under official active duty military orders after the closing date of registration. To register, the elector shall furnish a copy of his or her official military orders.

(b) On or before the day of election, or the first day a vote center opens, the elections official shall deliver to the precinct board a list of military or overseas voters who registered under this section.



######### 3109.  
If any military or overseas voter to whom a vote by mail ballot has been mailed and which ballot has not been voted by him or her returns to the county in which he or she is registered, or for a military or overseas voter qualified pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of Section 321, to the county in which the applicant’s parent or legal guardian resided when the parent or legal guardian last lived within the territorial limits of the United States or the District of Columbia on or before election day, he or she may apply for a second vote by mail ballot pursuant to Section 3014. The elections official shall then issue another vote by mail ballot to the voter, or the elections official shall certify to the precinct board that the voter is eligible to vote in the election.



######### 3110.  
If any military or overseas voter returns to the county of their residence, or for a military or overseas voter qualified pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of Section 321, to the county in which the applicant’s parent or legal guardian resided when the parent or legal guardian last lived within the territorial limits of the United States or the District of Columbia, after the seventh day prior to the date of the election, they may appear before the elections official and make application for registration. The elections official shall register the voter, if the voter is not registered, and deliver to the voter a vote by mail ballot which may be voted in the elections official’s office or voted outside the elections official’s office on or before the close of the polls on the day of election and returned as are other vote by mail ballots.



######### 3111.  
If a military or overseas voter is unable to appear at their polling place because of being recalled to service after the seventh day prior to the date of the election, but before 5 p.m. on the day before the day of the election, they may appear before the elections official in the county in which the military or overseas voter is registered or, if within the state, in the county in which the voter is recalled to service. The elections official shall deliver to the voter a vote by mail ballot which may be voted in the elections official’s office or voted outside the elections official’s office on or before the close of the polls on the day of election and returned as are other vote by mail ballots. To be counted, the ballot shall be returned to the elections official’s office in person, by facsimile transmission, or by an authorized person on or before the close of the polls on the day of the election. If the military or overseas voter appears in the county in which the voter is recalled to service, rather than the county to which the voter is registered, the elections official shall coordinate with the elections official in the county in which the military or overseas voter is registered to provide the ballot that contains the appropriate measures and races for the precinct in which the military or overseas voter is registered.



######### 3112.  
Whenever by any statute of the United States, provision is made for vote by mail, an application for a vote by mail ballot made under that law may be given the same effect as an application for a vote by mail ballot made under this code.

If, by any federal statute, provision is made for the transmission of applications for vote by mail status to the Secretary of State, he or she shall transmit the applications to the county elections official of the county in which the applicant claims residence, or for a military or overseas voter qualified pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of Section 321, to the county in which the applicant’s parent or legal guardian resided when the parent or legal guardian last lived within the territorial limits of the United States or the District of Columbia.



######### 3113.  
If by any act of Congress which is now or may become effective during the effective period of this section, provision is made for voting by military or overseas voters, that act shall control and be superior to any conflicting provisions of this code, and all state, county, municipal, and district officers who are charged with the performance of duties with reference to the election laws of this state shall perform the duties and discharge the obligations placed upon them by that act of Congress. It is the purpose and intent of this section that full effect shall be given to ballots cast by military or overseas voters under federal statutes in order that no person shall be deprived of his or her vote by virtue of having cast his or her ballot under any federal statute rather than under the laws of this state.



######### 3114.  
(a) For an election for which this state has not received a waiver pursuant to the federal Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act (52 U.S.C. Sec. 20301 et seq.), not sooner than 60 days but not later than 45 days before the election, the elections official shall transmit a ballot and balloting materials to each military or overseas voter who, by that date, submits a valid ballot application pursuant to Section 3102.

(b) If a valid ballot application from a military or overseas voter arrives after the 45th day before the election, the elections official charged with distributing a ballot and balloting materials to that voter shall transmit them to the voter as soon as practicable after the application arrives.



######### 3116.

(b) This section does not apply to a county when conducting an all-mailed ballot election pursuant to Section 4005.

(c) This section shall become operative on January 1, 2020, or one year after the date on which the Secretary of State certifies a remote accessible vote by mail system pursuant to Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 19280) of Division 19, whichever is later.



######### 3117.  
A valid ballot cast shall be counted if it is received by the elections official in accordance with Section 3020.



######### 3118.  
The elections official shall include with the ballot a declaration to be signed by the military or overseas voter that a material misstatement of fact in completing the ballot may be grounds for a conviction of perjury under the laws of this state or the United States.



######### 3119.  
Elections officials shall implement an electronic free access system by which a military or overseas voter may determine by telephone, electronic mail, or Internet whether the military or overseas voter’s ballot has been received.



######### 3120.  
The elections official shall request an electronic mail address from each military or overseas voter who registers to vote. A military or overseas voter who provides an electronic mail address may request that his or her application for a ballot be considered a standing request for electronic delivery of a ballot for all elections conducted in the jurisdiction in which he or she is eligible to vote. An elections official shall provide for electronic delivery of a ballot to a military or overseas voter who makes a standing request for all elections conducted in the jurisdiction in which he or she is eligible to vote.



######### 3121.  
(a) As soon as practicable before an election, each elections official shall publish on his or her Internet Web site a list of all of the ballot measures and federal, state, and local offices that, as of that date, the elections official expects to be on the ballot on the date of the election. The list shall also contain specific instructions for how a voter is to indicate on a federal write-in absentee ballot the voter’s choice for each office to be filled and for each ballot measure to be contested.

(b) A military or overseas voter may request a copy of the list described in subdivision (a). The elections official shall send the list to the voter by facsimile, electronic mail, or regular mail, as the voter requests.

(c) Not later than 60 days before a regularly scheduled election and as soon as practicable before a special election, the elections official shall update on his or her Internet Web site the list described in subdivision (a) with the certified candidates for each office and certified ballot measures and make the updated list publicly available.



######### 3122.  
(a) If a military or overseas voter’s mistake or omission in the completion of a document under this chapter does not prevent determining whether a military or overseas voter is eligible to vote, the mistake or omission does not invalidate the document. In a write-in ballot authorized by this chapter, if the intention of the voter is discernible under this state’s uniform definition of what constitutes a vote and the ballot is eligible to be counted pursuant to Sections 3019 and 3106, an abbreviation, misspelling, or other minor variation in the form of the name of a candidate or a political party shall be accepted as a valid vote.

(b) An authentication, other than the declaration specified in Section 3106 or 3118 or the declaration on the federal postcard application and federal write-in absentee ballot, is not required for execution of a document under this chapter. The declaration and any information in the declaration may be compared with information on file to ascertain the validity of the document.



######### 3123.  
A court may issue an injunction or grant other equitable relief appropriate to ensure substantial compliance with, or enforce, this chapter on application by either of the following:

(a) A military or overseas voter.

(b) An elections official in this state.

(a) If this procedure would result in a total number of delegates being elected greater than the number to which the state is entitled, the calculation outlined above shall be repeated using a total vote cast for all groups of delegates that is sufficiently larger than the actual total vote so as to give a total number of delegates elected equal to the number to which the state is entitled.

(b) If this procedure would result in a total number of delegates being elected smaller than the number to which the state is entitled, the calculation outlined above shall be repeated using a total vote cast for all groups of delegates that is sufficiently smaller than the actual total vote so as to give a total number of delegates elected equal to the number to which the state is entitled.

##### CHAPTER 7. Income Tax Return Disclosure Requirements [6880 - 6884]  

######### 6880.  
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Presidential Tax Transparency and Accountability Act.



######### 6881.  
The Legislature finds and declares that the State of California has a strong interest in ensuring that its voters make informed, educated choices in the voting booth. To this end, the state has mandated that extensive amounts of information be provided to voters, including county and state voter information guides. The Legislature also finds and declares that a Presidential candidate’s income tax returns provide voters with essential information regarding the candidate’s potential conflicts of interest, business dealings, financial status, and charitable donations. The information in tax returns therefore helps voters to make a more informed decision. The Legislature further finds and declares that as one of the largest centers of economic activity in the world, the State of California has a special interest in the President refraining from corrupt or self-enriching behaviors while in office. The people of California can better estimate the risks of any given Presidential candidate engaging in corruption or the appearance of corruption if they have access to candidates’ tax returns. Finally, the State of California has an interest in ensuring that any violations of the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution or statutory prohibitions on behavior such as insider trading are detected and punished. Mandated disclosure of Presidential candidates’ tax returns will enable enforcement of the laws against whichever candidate is elected President. The Legislature finds and declares that compliance costs with this requirement will be trivial.



######### 6882.  
For purposes of this chapter, “income tax return” means any tax or information return, declaration of estimated tax, or claim for refund required by, or provided for or permitted under, the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and that is filed on behalf of, or with respect to any person, and any amendment or supplement thereto, including supporting schedules, attachments, or lists that are supplemental to, or part of, the return so filed.



######### 6883.  
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, the Secretary of State shall not print the name of a candidate for President of the United States on a primary election ballot, unless the candidate, at least 98 days before the presidential primary election, files with the Secretary of State copies of every income tax return the candidate filed with the Internal Revenue Service in the five most recent taxable years, in accordance with the procedure set forth in Section 6884.

(b) If the candidate has not filed the candidate’s income tax return with the Internal Revenue Service for the tax year immediately preceding the primary election, the candidate shall submit a copy of the income tax return to the Secretary of State within five days of filing the return with the Internal Revenue Service.

(c) The requirement in subdivision (a) does not apply to any year in which the candidate was not required to file the candidate’s income tax return with the Internal Revenue Service.



######### 6884.  
(a) The candidate shall submit the following to the Secretary of State:

(1) (A) Two copies of each tax return required by Section 6883. One copy of each tax return shall be identical to the version submitted to the Internal Revenue Service, without redactions. The second copy of each tax return shall be redacted pursuant to this paragraph. The tax returns shall be provided to the Secretary of State in hard-copy form.

(B) The candidate shall redact the following information from the redacted version of each tax return:

(i) Social security numbers.

(ii) Home address.

(iii) Telephone number.

(iv) Email address.

(v) Medical information.

(C) The candidate may also redact the following information from the redacted version of each tax return:

(i) Names of dependent minors.

(ii) Employer identification number.

(iii) Business addresses.

(iv) Preparer tax identification number, address, telephone number, and email address of paid tax return preparers.

(2) A written consent form, signed by the candidate, granting the Secretary of State permission to publicly release a version of the candidate’s tax returns redacted pursuant to this section. The Secretary of State shall prepare a standard consent form consistent with this paragraph.

(b) The Secretary of State shall review the redacted copy of each tax return submitted by the candidate to ensure that the redactions comply with subdivision (a). If the Secretary of State determines that the candidate has redacted information other than that permitted by subdivision (a), the Secretary of State shall prepare a new version of the tax return with only the redactions permitted by that subdivision.

(c) (1) Within five days of receipt of the candidate’s tax returns, the Secretary of State shall make redacted versions of the tax returns available to the public on the Secretary of State’s internet website. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary of State shall make public the redacted versions of the tax returns submitted by the candidate pursuant to subdivision (a).

(2) If the Secretary of State is required to prepare a redacted version of a tax return pursuant to subdivision (b), the Secretary of State shall make public that version.

(3) The public versions of the tax returns shall be continuously posted until the official canvass for the presidential primary election is completed. Upon completion of the official canvass, the Secretary of State shall remove the public versions of the tax returns.

(4) The Secretary of State shall retain the paper copies of the submitted tax returns until the completion of the official canvass of the ensuing general election. Thereafter, the paper copies of the submitted tax returns shall be destroyed as soon as practicable, unless the Secretary of State has received a court order, or a lawful written request from a state or federal governmental agency, directing the Secretary of State to preserve the submitted tax returns.

######### 6903.

######### 6914.

Article 3. Manner of Appointing Presidential Electors in Member States

 

 Prior to the time set by law for the meeting and voting by the presidential electors, the chief election official of each member state shall determine the number of votes for each presidential slate in each state of the United States and in the District of Columbia in which votes have been cast in a statewide popular election and shall add such votes together to produce a “national popular vote total” for each presidential slate.

The chief election official of each member state shall designate the presidential slate with the largest national popular vote total as the “national popular vote winner.”

The presidential elector certifying official of each member state shall certify the appointment in that official’s own state of the elector slate nominated in that state in association with the national popular vote winner.

At least six days before the day fixed by law for the meeting and voting by the presidential electors, each member state shall make a final determination of the number of popular votes cast in the state for each presidential slate and shall communicate an official statement of such determination within 24 hours to the chief election official of each other member state.

The chief election official of each member state shall treat as conclusive an official statement containing the number of popular votes in a state for each presidential slate made by the day established by federal law for making a state’s final determination conclusive as to the counting of electoral votes by Congress.

In event of a tie for the national popular vote winner, the presidential elector certifying official of each member state shall certify the appointment of the elector slate nominated in association with the presidential slate receiving the largest number of popular votes within that official’s own state.

If, for any reason, the number of presidential electors nominated in a member state in association with the national popular vote winner is less than or greater than that state’s number of electoral votes, the presidential candidate on the presidential slate that has been designated as the national popular vote winner shall have the power to nominate the presidential electors for that state and that state’s presidential elector certifying official shall certify the appointment of such nominees.

The chief election official of each member state shall immediately release to the public all vote counts or statements of votes as they are determined or obtained.

This article shall govern the appointment of presidential electors in each member state in any year in which this agreement is, on July 20, in effect in states cumulatively possessing a majority of the electoral votes. 

 

Article 4. Other Provisions

 

This agreement shall take effect when states cumulatively possessing a majority of the electoral votes have enacted this agreement in substantially the same form and the enactments by such states have taken effect in each state.

Any member state may withdraw from this agreement, except that a withdrawal occurring six months or less before the end of a President’s term shall not become effective until a President or Vice President shall have been qualified to serve the next term.

The chief executive of each member state shall promptly notify the chief executive of all other states of when this agreement has been enacted and has taken effect in that official’s state, when the state has withdrawn from this agreement, and when this agreement takes effect generally.

This agreement shall terminate if the electoral college is abolished.

If any provision of this agreement is held invalid, the remaining provisions shall not be affected. 

 

Article 5. Definitions

 

 For purposes of this agreement, “chief executive” shall mean the governor of a state of the United States or the Mayor of the District of Columbia; “elector slate” shall mean a slate of candidates who have been nominated in a state for the position of presidential elector in association with a presidential slate; “chief election official” shall mean the state official or body that is authorized to certify the total number of popular votes for each presidential slate; “presidential elector” shall mean an elector for President and Vice President of the United States; “presidential elector certifying official” shall mean the state official or body that is authorized to certify the appointment of the state’s presidential electors; “presidential slate” shall mean a slate of two persons, the first of whom has been nominated as a candidate for President of the United States and the second of whom has been nominated as a candidate for Vice President of the United States, or any legal successors to such persons, regardless of whether both names appear on the ballot presented to the voter in a particular state; “state” shall mean a state of the United States and the District of Columbia; and “statewide popular election” shall mean a general election in which votes are cast for presidential slates by individual voters and counted on a statewide basis.

#### CHAPTER 4. County Central Committee [7200 - 7244]  


##### ARTICLE 1. Members [7200 - 7216]  

######### 7200.  
(a) In each county containing less than five Assembly districts, a county committee shall be elected by supervisor districts, and the number to be elected from any supervisor district shall be determined as follows: There shall be taken the number of votes cast in the supervisor district at the last gubernatorial election for that party’s candidate for Governor, or, if the party had no candidate for Governor, for the candidate of the party voted on throughout the state who received the greatest number of votes and who was the candidate of that party alone. This number shall be divided by one-twentieth of the number of votes cast in that county for Governor or, where the party had no candidate for Governor, for the candidate mentioned above. The integer next larger than the quotient obtained by that division shall constitute the number of members of the committee to be elected by that party in that supervisor district.

(b) The committees in counties containing less than five Assembly districts shall be composed of not less than 21 members. If the procedure outlined above would result in less than 21 members being elected for any committee, the number of votes cast for this party’s candidate in each supervisor district shall be divided by an amount sufficiently smaller than one-twentieth of the votes cast for Governor in that county as to give a membership in the committee equal to or the nearest amount that is greater than 21 members.



######### 7201.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in a county of the fifth class as defined in Section 28026 of the Government Code, the elected members of the county central committee shall be elected by Assembly districts and shall consist of six members elected from each Assembly district, whether wholly or partly within the county, provided each such member is a resident of the county and of the Assembly district which the member represents. Only a person who is a resident of the county may vote for a candidate for membership to the county central committee and may vote only for candidates seeking to represent the Assembly district in which the voter resides.



######### 7201.1.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the County of Sacramento, the elected members of the county central committee shall be elected by supervisor districts with six members elected from each supervisor district. Each member shall be a resident of the county and of the supervisor district that the member represents. Only a person who is a resident of the county may vote for a candidate for membership to the county central committee and may vote only for candidates seeking to represent the supervisor district in which the voter resides.



######### 7201.2.  
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the County of Alameda, the elected members of the county central committee shall be elected by Assembly districts and the number to be elected from any Assembly district shall be determined as follows: There shall be taken the number of votes cast in that portion of the Assembly district lying within the County of Alameda at the last gubernatorial election for that party’s candidate for Governor, or, if the party had no candidate for Governor, for the candidate of the party voted on throughout the state who received the greatest number of votes and who was the candidate of that party alone. This number shall be divided by one-thirtieth of the number of votes cast in the county for Governor or, where the party had no candidate for Governor, for the candidate mentioned above. The integer next larger than the quotient obtained by that division shall constitute the number of members of the committee to be elected by that party in that Assembly district.

(b) If the procedure described above would result in less than 30 members being elected for any committee, the number of votes cast for this party’s candidate in that portion of each Assembly district lying within the County of Alameda shall be divided by an amount sufficiently smaller than one-thirtieth of the votes cast for Governor in the county as to give a membership in the committee equal to or the nearest amount that is greater than 30 members.

Only a person who is a resident of the county may vote for a candidate for membership to the county central committee and may vote only for candidates seeking to represent the Assembly district in which the voter resides.



######### 7202.  
In each county containing more than four and less than 20 Assembly districts, a county central committee shall be elected from Assembly districts and shall consist of six members elected from each Assembly district.



######### 7203.  
In each county containing 20 or more Assembly districts a county central committee shall consist of seven members elected from each Assembly district contained either wholly or partially within the county. In an Assembly district that lies only partially within a county containing 20 or more Assembly districts, the seven members shall be elected from that portion of the Assembly district contained within the county.



######### 7204.  
(a) In the City and County of San Francisco, the county central committee shall be elected from the two Assembly districts located in the city and county and shall consist of 24 members. Whichever of the two Assembly districts consists of the majority of the registered Democrats in the city and county shall elect 14 members and the Assembly district that consists of the minority of the registered Democrats in the city and county shall elect 10 members.

(b) Both of the following shall apply for purposes of this section:

(1) “Registered Democrat” means any voter in the city and county who has expressed a preference for the Democratic Party on his or her affidavit of registration pursuant to Sections 2150, 2151, and 2152 as of the 154th day prior to the first direct primary election after any redistricting of Assembly district boundaries.

(2) The City and County of San Francisco Department of Elections, or any comparable successor agency, shall calculate the percentage of the total registered Democrats in each Assembly district in the city and county.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for the June 5, 2012, statewide primary election, signers of nomination papers for candidates for the county central committee shall be voters who disclosed a preference, pursuant to Section 2151, for the Democratic Party and who are residents in the County of San Francisco, regardless of whether they are residents of the district in which the candidate is to be voted on.



######### 7205.  
Notwithstanding this article, each county central committee by resolution may provide for the election of all or a portion of central committee members to represent individual central committee districts. The member shall reside in the district he or she represents but shall be elected at large within the Assembly district in which the county central committee district he or she represents is located.

The county central committee shall reapportion itself at least every 10 years, prior to the June primary election of that year. Each district shall be apportioned on the basis of the number of registered Democrats for the June primary in each even-numbered year, with no more than a 10-percent deviation from the average. Each district shall be compact, contiguous, and utilize any natural and neighborhood boundaries. The district boundaries shall not cut across any district lines of a precinct as drawn by the elections official for the last general or consolidated election.



######### 7206.  
In each county the nominee of this party for Senator or the incumbent Senator, the nominees of this party for the Assembly, and any person elected to either the Senate or Assembly at a special election to fill a vacancy in that house, and the nominee of this party for Representative in Congress, and any person elected at a special election to fill a vacancy in the House of Representatives, shall be ex officio members of this committee. If the person elected from one party at the special election for an Assembly or Senate seat, or for the House of Representatives, shall be other than the nominee of that party for the same office at the prior election, the ex officio membership of the nominee shall expire immediately upon certification by the Secretary of State of the election. Ex officio members shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges, including the right to vote, and shall have the same standing in every way as other members of this committee, except they shall not be entitled to a ballot designation of incumbent upon seeking election to this committee in the next presidential primary.

An incumbent Member of the Senate or Assembly at the time of the meeting of the committee may appoint an alternate member without authorization from that committee, if the member desires to appoint an alternate.

That alternate member shall have the right to vote only with the written authorization of the member who appointed him or her. An alternate member of a county central committee shall be subject to the rules and regulations of the committee.

An alternate member must meet the same qualifications as the regular member and may vote only in the absence of the member who appointed him or her.



######### 7209.  
(a) A person is not eligible for election to a committee if the person’s affidavit of registration does not state a political party preference for this party at the time of the person’s election.

(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a) or Section 8001, a person who is not a United States citizen, but who would be eligible to register to vote if the person were a United States citizen, is eligible for election to a committee if all of the following conditions are met:

(1) The bylaws of the committee permit a person who is not a United States citizen, but who would be eligible to register to vote if the person were a United States citizen, to serve as a member of the committee.

(2) The person meets all other eligibility requirements for election to the committee that are imposed by the bylaws of the committee or this code.

In lieu thereof, the board of supervisors shall declare elected the candidates who have been nominated.



######### 7229.

######### 7230.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a county central committee, in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the committee, may select its members at any time by holding a caucus or convention, or by using any other method of selection approved by the committee.

######### 7400.  
In each county containing less than five Assembly districts, a county central committee shall be elected by supervisor districts, and the number to be elected from any supervisor district shall be determined as follows: There shall be taken the number of votes cast in the supervisor district at the last gubernatorial election for that party’s candidate for Governor, or, if the party had no candidate for Governor, for the candidate of the party voted on throughout the state who received the greatest number of votes and who was the candidate of that party alone. This number shall be divided by one-twentieth of the number of votes cast in that county for Governor or, where the party had no candidate for Governor, for the candidate mentioned above. The integer next larger than the quotient obtained by such division shall constitute the number of members of the committee to be elected by that party in that supervisor district.

The committees in counties containing less than five Assembly districts shall be composed of not less than 21 members. If the procedure outlined above would result in less than 21 members being elected for any committee, the number of votes cast for this party’s candidate in each supervisor district shall be divided by an amount sufficiently smaller than one-twentieth of the votes cast for Governor in that county as to give a membership in the committee equal to or the nearest amount which is greater than 21 members.

This number shall be divided by one-thirtieth of the number of votes cast in Sacramento County for Governor or, where the party did not have a candidate for Governor, for the candidate mentioned above. The integer next larger than the quotient obtained by that division shall constitute the number of members of the committee to be elected by that party in that supervisor district.

(b) The Sacramento County Central Committee shall be composed of not less than 31 members. If the procedure outlined above would result in less than 31 members being elected for any committee, the number of votes cast for this party’s candidate in each supervisor district shall be divided by an amount sufficiently smaller than one-thirtieth of the votes cast for Governor in Sacramento County as to give a membership on the committee equal to or the nearest amount that is greater than 31 members.

(2) This number shall be divided by one-twenty-second of the number of votes cast in Santa Clara County for Governor or, where the party did not have a candidate for Governor, for the candidate mentioned above. The integer next larger than the quotient obtained by that division shall constitute the number of members of the committee to be elected by that party in that supervisor district.

(b) The Santa Clara County Central Committee shall be composed of not less than 23 members. If the procedure outlined above would result in less than 23 members being elected to the committee, the number of votes cast for this party’s candidate in each supervisor district shall be divided by an amount sufficiently smaller than one-twenty-second of the votes cast for Governor in Santa Clara County as to give a membership on the committee equal to or the nearest amount that is greater than 23 members.

(2) This number shall be divided by one-thirtieth of the number of votes cast in San Bernardino County for Governor or, where the party did not have a candidate for Governor, for the candidate mentioned above.

(c) If a write-in candidate is entitled to ex officio membership on each affected county central committee pursuant to subdivision (b), each affected county central committee shall designate the party nominee described in subdivision (b) as an additional ex officio member to its committee.

######### 8061.  
(a) If a candidate submits an in-lieu-filing-fee petition pursuant to Section 8106, any or all signatures appearing on the petition, which would be valid under Section 8041, shall be counted towards the number of voters required to sign a nomination paper. If an in-lieu-filing-fee petition contains a requisite number of valid signatures under Section 8062, the candidate shall not be required to file nomination papers.

(b) If an in-lieu-filing-fee petition does not contain the requisite number of valid signatures as set forth in Section 8062, the candidate shall be entitled to file, within the time period allowed for filing nomination papers, a nomination paper in order to obtain the requisite number of valid signatures required to be submitted to the elections official on a nomination paper. A candidate who submits a nomination paper pursuant to this subdivision shall only be required to obtain the number of signatures thereon needed to supplement the in-lieu-filing-fee petition so that the combination of signatures appearing on the in-lieu-filing-fee petition and the nomination paper equals or exceeds the requisite number of signatures set forth in Section 8062.

(a) The filing fees for all candidates shall be paid at the time the candidates obtain their nomination forms from the county elections official. The county elections official shall not accept any papers unless the fees are paid at the time required by this section, or unless satisfactory evidence is given to the county elections official or to the registrar of voters that the fee has been paid at the time of the declaration of candidacy in another county.

The number of forms that the elections official shall furnish a candidate shall be a quantity that provides the candidates with spaces for signatures sufficient in number to equal the number of signatures that the candidate is required to secure pursuant to subdivision (a) if the candidate desires that number of forms. However, the elections official, rather than provide the candidate with the number of forms set forth in the preceding sentence, or upon the request of a candidate, may provide the candidate with a master form that may be duplicated by the candidate at the candidate’s expense for the purpose of circulating additional petitions. The Secretary of State shall provide the master form. The elections official may provide candidates a form other than the master form provided by the Secretary of State.

No other form except the form furnished by the Secretary of State or the elections official or forms duplicated from a master form shall be used to secure signatures.

(1) Any registered voter may sign an in-lieu-filing-fee petition for any candidate for whom the voter is eligible to vote.

(2) If a voter signs more candidates’ petitions than there are offices to be filled, the voter’s signatures shall be valid only on those petitions that, taken in the order they were filed, do not exceed the number of offices to be filled.

(3) In-lieu-filing-fee petitions shall be filed at least 30 days before the close of the nomination period. Within 10 days after receipt of a petition, the elections official shall notify the candidate of any deficiency. The candidate shall then, at the time of obtaining nomination forms, pay a pro rata portion of the filing fee to cover the deficiency.

(4) If the petition is circulated for an office in more than one county, the candidate shall submit the signatures to the elections official in the county for which the petition was circulated. The elections official shall, at least two days after verifying the signatures on the petition, notify the Secretary of State of the total number of valid signatures. If the number of signatures is insufficient, the Secretary of State shall notify the candidate and the elections officials of the fact. The candidate may submit the necessary number of valid signatures at least 30 days before the close of the period for circulating nomination papers. Each circulator shall meet the requirements of Section 102.

(5) Each candidate may submit a greater number of signatures to allow for subsequent losses due to invalidity of some signatures. The elections official shall not be required to determine the validity of a greater number of signatures than that required by this section.

(1) If the nomination period for the special election is 12 days or more, the in-lieu-filing-fee petitions shall be filed at least nine days before the close of the nomination period. Within three days after receipt of a petition, the elections official shall notify the candidate of any deficiency. The candidate shall then, at the time of obtaining nomination forms, pay a pro rata portion of the filing fee to cover the deficiency.

(2) If the nomination period for the special election is 11 days or less, the Secretary of State shall set the time for filing in-lieu-filing-fee petitions and the time by which the elections official shall notify the candidate of any deficiency. If there is a deficiency, the candidate shall, at the time of obtaining nomination forms, pay a pro rata portion of the filing fee to cover the deficiency.

(b) If the number of days for a candidate to collect signatures on a petition in lieu of a filing fee for a special election that is held to fill a vacancy is less than the number of days that a candidate would have to collect signatures on a petition for a regular election for the same office, the elections official shall reduce the required number of signatures for the petition, as specified in subdivision (a) of Section 8106, by the same proportion as the reduction in time for the candidate to collect signatures.

(4) In no case shall the tie be determined by lot.



######### 8143.  
If the number of candidates elected at a primary election to any nonpartisan office is less than the number of persons to be elected to that office, there shall be printed on the ballot, in a group, only the names of the other candidates receiving the next highest number of votes for nomination to that office as may equal twice the number of persons remaining to be elected to that office, or a smaller number if the list of candidates is exhausted.

#### PART 2. INDEPENDENT NOMINATIONS [8300 - 8550]  


##### CHAPTER 1. General Provisions [8300 - 8304]  

######### 8300.  
A candidate for a partisan office, including that of presidential elector, may be nominated subsequent to, or by other means than, a primary election pursuant to this chapter. A candidate for nonpartisan office or for voter-nominated office may be nominated subsequent to, or by other means than, a primary election pursuant to this chapter only if a candidate was not nominated or elected at the primary election for that office.



######### 8301.  
A candidate for whom a nomination paper has been filed as a partisan candidate at a primary election, and who is defeated for his or her party nomination at the primary election, is ineligible for nomination as an independent candidate.



######### 8302.  
For the purposes of this chapter, Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 8000) of Part 1, and Part 4 (commencing with Section 8800), so far as consistent with this chapter, shall apply to all offices for which nominations are made at the presidential primary and direct primary elections, as well as to elections for any other office to which those provisions would not ordinarily apply.

######### 8304.  
When a group of candidates for presidential electors designates the presidential and vice presidential candidates for whom all of the group pledge themselves to vote, the names of the presidential candidate and vice presidential candidate designated by that group shall be printed on the ballot pursuant to Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 13100) of Division 13.








##### CHAPTER 3. Nomination Papers [8400 - 8409]  

######### 8400.  
Nomination papers for a statewide office for which the candidate is to be nominated shall be signed by voters of the state equal to not less in number than 1 percent of the entire number of registered voters of the state at the time of the close of registration prior to the preceding general election. Nomination papers for an office, other than a statewide office, shall be signed by the voters of the area for which the candidate is to be nominated, not less in number than 3 percent of the entire number of registered voters in the area at the time of the close of registration prior to the preceding general election. Nomination papers for Representative in Congress, State Senator or Assembly Member, to be voted for at a special election to fill a vacancy, shall be signed by voters in the district not less in number than 500 or 1 percent of the entire vote cast in the area at the preceding general election, whichever is less, nor more than 1,000.



######### 8401.  
(a) Upon receiving the nomination paper if, from the examination of such pursuant to Section 8400, more than 500 signatures have been signed on the nomination paper petition, the elections official may use a random sampling technique for verification of signatures. The random sample of signatures to be verified shall be drawn in such a manner that every signature filed with the elections official shall be given an equal opportunity to be included in the sample. The random sampling shall include an examination of at least 500 or 5 percent of the signatures, whichever is greater.

(b) If the statistical sampling shows that the number of valid signatures is within 90 to 110 percent of the number of signatures of qualified voters needed to declare the nomination paper sufficient, the elections official shall examine and verify each signature filed.

(c) In determining from the records of registration, what number of valid signatures are signed on the nomination paper, the elections official may check the signatures against facsimiles of voters’ signatures, provided that the method of preparing and displaying the facsimiles is permitted by law.

(d) The elections official shall attach to the nomination paper, a certificate showing the result of this examination, and shall notify the candidate of either the sufficiency or insufficiency of the nomination paper.

(e) If the nomination paper is found insufficient, no action shall be taken on the nomination paper. However, the failure to secure sufficient signatures, shall not preclude the submission later of an entirely new nomination paper to the same effect.

(f) If the nomination paper is found to be sufficient, the elections official shall certify the results of the examination.



######### 8402.  
When a nomination paper or sections of a nomination paper have been received which contain the number of valid signatures required in Section 8400, the officer with whom those papers are required to be left shall not accept additional sections of the nomination paper for the candidate named in it.



######### 8403.

(b) All nomination documents that are required to be filed in the office of the Secretary of State shall, within 24 days after being left with the county elections official in compliance with paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a), be forwarded by the county elections official to the Secretary of State, who shall receive and file them.

(c) If the total number of signatures submitted to a county elections official for an office entirely within that county does not equal the number of signatures needed to qualify the candidate, the county elections official shall declare the petition void and is not required to verify the signatures. If the district falls within two or more counties, the county elections official shall within two working days report in writing to the Secretary of State the total number of signatures submitted.

(d) If the Secretary of State finds that the total number of signatures submitted in the district or state is less than the minimum number required to qualify the candidate he or she shall within one working day notify in writing the counties involved that they need not verify the signatures.



######### 8404.  
Each signer of a nomination paper shall sign but one paper for the same office, except that in case two or more persons are to be elected to the same office at the same election, an elector may sign the nomination papers of as many persons as there are persons to be elected to the office, and that act on the part of an elector shall not be deemed in conflict with the signer’s statement prescribed in this chapter.

The signer shall state his or her place of residence, giving his or her street and number, if any.



######### 8405.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if an independent candidate submits an in-lieu-filing-fee petition pursuant to Section 8106, the county elections official, upon the request of the candidate, shall accept all valid signatures appearing on the candidate’s in-lieu-filing-fee petition toward the number of signatures required to be submitted on an in-lieu-filing-fee petition and on a nomination paper.

If the in-lieu-filing-fee petition does not contain the requisite number of signatures required under Section 8400, the candidate shall be entitled to file, within the time period allowed for filing nomination papers, a nomination paper in order to obtain the requisite number of valid signatures required to be submitted to the elections official pursuant to this chapter.



######### 8406.  
Any nomination paper may be presented in sections, but each section shall contain the name of the candidate and the name of the office for which the candidate is proposed for nomination. Each section shall bear the name of the county for which it is circulated.



######### 8407.  
The affidavit of any circulator obtaining signatures under this chapter shall be verified free of charge by any officer authorized to administer oaths.



######### 8408.  
A verified nomination paper is prima facie evidence that the signatures to it are genuine and that the persons signing it are voters unless it is otherwise proven by comparison of the signatures with the affidavits of registration in the office of the county elections official.



######### 8409.  
Each candidate or group of candidates shall submit a nomination paper that shall be substantially in the following form:

##### PART 5. INCOME TAX RETURN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS [8900 - 8903]  

######### 8900.  
The Legislature finds and declares that the State of California has a strong interest in ensuring that its voters make informed, educated choices in the voting booth. To this end, the state has mandated that extensive amounts of information be provided to voters, including county and state voter information guides. The Legislature also finds and declares that the income tax returns of candidates for Governor provide voters with essential information regarding the candidate’s potential conflicts of interest, business dealings, financial status, and charitable donations. The information in tax returns therefore helps voters to make a more informed decision. The Legislature further finds and declares that as one of the largest centers of economic activity in the world, the State of California has a special interest in state elected officials refraining from corrupt or self-enriching behaviors while in office. The people of California can better estimate the risks of any given candidate for Governor engaging in corruption or the appearance of corruption if they have access to candidates’ tax returns. Finally, the State of California has an interest in ensuring that any violations of statutory prohibitions on behavior such as insider trading are detected and punished. Mandated disclosure of the tax returns of candidates for Governor will enable enforcement of the laws against whichever candidates are elected to those offices. The Legislature finds and declares that compliance costs with this requirement will be trivial.



######### 8901.  
For the purposes of this part, “income tax return” has the same meaning as in Section 6882.



######### 8902.  
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, the name of a candidate for Governor shall not be printed on a direct primary election ballot, unless the candidate, at least 88 days before the direct primary election, files with the Secretary of State copies of every income tax return the candidate filed with the Internal Revenue Service in the five most recent taxable years, in accordance with the procedure set forth in Section 8903.

(b) If the candidate has not filed the candidate’s income tax return with the Internal Revenue Service for the tax year immediately preceding the primary election, the candidate shall submit a copy of the income tax return to the Secretary of State within five days of filing the return with the Internal Revenue Service.

(c) The requirement in subdivision (a) does not apply to any year in which the candidate was not required to file the candidate’s income tax return with the Internal Revenue Service.



######### 8903.  
(a) The candidate shall submit the following to the Secretary of State:

(1) (A) Two copies of each tax return required by Section 8902. One copy of each tax return shall be identical to the version submitted to the Internal Revenue Service, without redactions. The second copy of each tax return shall be redacted pursuant to this paragraph. The tax returns shall be provided to the Secretary of State in hard-copy form.

(B) The candidate shall redact the following information from the redacted version of each tax return:

(i) Social security numbers.

(ii) Home address.

(iii) Telephone number.

(iv) Email address.

(v) Medical information.

(C) The candidate may also redact the following information from the redacted version of each tax return:

(i) Names of dependent minors.

(ii) Employer identification number.

(iii) Business addresses.

(iv) Preparer tax identification number, address, telephone number, and email address of paid tax return preparers.

(2) A written consent form, signed by the candidate, granting the Secretary of State permission to publically release a version of the candidate’s tax returns redacted pursuant to this section. The Secretary of State shall prepare a standard consent form consistent with this paragraph.

(b) The Secretary of State shall review the redacted copy of each tax return submitted by the candidate to ensure that the redactions comply with subdivision (a). If the Secretary of State determines that the candidate has redacted information other than that permitted by subdivision (a), or failed to redact information required to be redacted by subdivision (a), the Secretary of State shall notify the candidate of any deficiencies. The candidate shall submit corrected hard copies of the tax return no later than 5:00 p.m. on the 78th day prior to the direct primary election. If the corrected hard copies are not timely submitted, the candidate shall not be qualified to have their name placed on the ballot of the direct primary election.

(c) (1) Within five days of receipt of the candidate’s tax returns, the Secretary of State shall make redacted versions of the tax returns available to the public on the Secretary of State’s internet website. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary of State shall make public the redacted versions of the tax returns submitted by the candidate pursuant to subdivision (a).

(2) If the candidate is required to submit a corrected redacted version of a tax return pursuant to subdivision (b), the Secretary of State shall make public that version.

(3) The public versions of the tax returns shall be continuously posted until the official canvass for the direct primary election is completed. Upon completion of the official canvass, the Secretary of State shall remove the public versions of the tax returns.

(4) The Secretary of State shall retain the paper copies of the submitted tax returns until the completion of the official canvass of the ensuing general election. Thereafter, the paper copies of the submitted tax returns shall be destroyed as soon as practicable, unless the Secretary of State has received a court order, or a lawful written request from a state or federal governmental agency, directing the Secretary of State to preserve the submitted tax returns.

######### 9030.  
(a) Each section of the petition shall be filed with the elections official of the county or city and county for which it was circulated, but all sections circulated in any county or city and county shall be filed at the same time. Once filed, no petition section shall be amended except by order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

(b) Within eight days after the filing of the petition, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, the elections official shall determine the total number of signatures affixed to the petition and shall transmit this information to the Secretary of State. If the total number of signatures filed with all elections officials is less than 100 percent of the number of qualified voters required to find the petition sufficient, the Secretary of State shall so notify the proponents and the elections officials, and no further action shall be taken with regard to the petition.

(c) If the number of signatures filed with all elections officials is 100 percent or more of the number of qualified voters needed to declare the petition sufficient, the Secretary of State shall immediately so notify the elections officials.

(d) Within 30 days after this notification, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, the elections official shall determine the number of qualified voters who have signed the petition. If more than 500 names have been signed on sections of the petition filed with an elections official, the elections official shall use a random sampling technique for verification of signatures, as determined by the Secretary of State. The random sample of signatures to be verified shall be drawn in such a manner that every signature filed with the elections official shall be given an equal opportunity to be included in the sample. The random sampling shall include an examination of at least 500 or 3 percent of the signatures, whichever is greater. In determining from the records of registration what number of qualified voters have signed the petition, the elections official may use any facsimiles of voters’ signatures provided that the method of preparing and displaying the facsimiles complies with law. A signature shall not be invalidated because of a variation of the signature caused by the substitution of initials for the first or middle name, or both, of the person signing the petition.

(e) The elections official, upon the completion of the examination, shall immediately attach to the petition, except the signatures thereto appended, a properly dated certificate, showing the result of the examination, and shall immediately transmit the petition and the certificate to the Secretary of State. A copy of this certificate shall be filed in the elections official’s office.

(g) If the certificates received from all elections officials by the Secretary of State total more than 110 percent of the number of qualified voters needed to find the petition sufficient, the Secretary of State shall certify that the measure is qualified for the ballot as provided in Section 9033.



######### 9031.  
(a) If the statistical sampling shows that the number of valid signatures is within 95 to 110 percent of the number of signatures of qualified voters needed to declare the petition sufficient, the Secretary of State shall order the examination and verification of the signatures filed, and shall so notify the elections officials. A signature shall not be invalidated because of a variation of the signature caused by the substitution of initials for the first or middle name, or both, of the person signing the petition.

(b) Within 30 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, after receipt of the order, the elections official or registrar of voters shall determine from the records of registration what number of qualified voters have signed the petition and if necessary the board of supervisors shall allow the elections official or registrar additional assistance for the purpose of examining the petition and provide for their compensation. In determining from the records of registration what number of qualified voters have signed the petition, the elections official or registrar of voters may use any file or list of registered voters maintained by their office, or the facsimiles of voters’ signatures, provided that the method of preparing and displaying the facsimiles complies with law.

(c) (1) During the examination and verification of the signatures filed, the elections official or registrar of voters shall submit one or more reports to the Secretary of State showing the number of signatures of qualified voters that have been verified as of that date. The Secretary of State shall determine the number of reports required to be submitted and the manner of their submission.

(2) The Secretary of State shall maintain a list indicating the number of verified signatures of qualified voters who have signed the petition based on the most recent reports submitted pursuant to paragraph (1). If the Secretary of State determines, prior to each county’s completing the examination of each signature filed, that based on the list the petition is signed by the requisite number of voters needed to declare the petition sufficient, the Secretary of State shall immediately notify the elections official or registrar of voters of every county or city and county in the state of this fact. Immediately after receipt of this notification, the elections official or registrar of voters may suspend signature verification until receipt of a certificate pursuant to Section 9033 or until otherwise instructed by the Secretary of State.

(d) The elections official or registrar, upon the completion of the examination or notification pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (c), shall immediately attach to the petition, except the signatures thereto appended, an amended certificate properly dated, showing the result of the examination and shall immediately transmit the petition, together with the amended certificate, to the Secretary of State. A copy of the amended certificate shall be filed in the elections official’s office.

(e) (1) If the amended certificates establish the petition’s sufficiency, the Secretary of State shall certify that the measure is qualified for the ballot as provided in Section 9033.

(2) If the amended certificates received from all elections officials by the Secretary of State establish that the petition has still been found insufficient, the Secretary of State shall immediately so notify the proponents and the elections officials.



######### 9032.  
The right to file the petition shall be reserved to its proponents, and any section thereof presented for filing by any person or persons other than the proponents of a measure or by persons duly authorized in writing by one or more of the proponents shall be disregarded by the elections official.



######### 9033.

An initiative measure may be proposed by presenting to the Secretary of State a petition that sets forth the text of the proposed statute or amendment to the Constitution and is certified to have been signed by registered voters equal in number to 5 percent in the case of a statute, and 8 percent in the case of an amendment to the Constitution, of the voters for all candidates for Governor at the last gubernatorial election preceding the issuance of the circulating title and summary for the initiative measure by the Attorney General.








##### ARTICLE 4. Measures Proposed by the Legislature [9040 - 9044]  

######### 9040.  
Every constitutional amendment, bond measure, or other legislative measure submitted to the people by the Legislature shall appear on the ballot of the first statewide election occurring at least 131 days after the adoption of the proposal by the Legislature.

If the ballot contains a question as to the confirmation of a justice of the Supreme Court or a court of appeal, the Secretary of State shall include in the state voter information guide a written explanation of the electoral procedure for justices of the Supreme Court and the courts of appeal. The explanation shall state the following:

“Under the California Constitution, justices of the Supreme Court and the courts of appeal are subject to confirmation by the voters. The public votes “yes” or “no” on whether to retain each justice.

“These judicial offices are nonpartisan.

“Before a person can become an appellate justice, the Governor must submit the candidate’s name to the Judicial Nominees Evaluation Commission, which is comprised of public members and lawyers. The commission conducts a thorough review of the candidate’s background and qualifications, with community input, and then forwards its evaluation of the candidate to the Governor.

“The Governor then reviews the commission’s evaluation and officially nominates the candidate, whose qualifications are subject to public comment before examination and review by the Commission on Judicial Appointments. That commission consists of the Chief Justice of California, the Attorney General of California, and a senior Presiding Justice of the Courts of Appeal. The Commission on Judicial Appointments must then confirm or reject the nomination. Only if confirmed does the nominee become a justice.

“Following confirmation, the justice is sworn into office and is subject to voter approval at the next gubernatorial election, and thereafter at the conclusion of each term. The term prescribed by the California Constitution for justices of the Supreme Court and courts of appeal is 12 years. Justices are confirmed by the Commission on Judicial Appointments only until the next gubernatorial election, at which time they run for retention of the remainder of the term, if any, of their predecessor, which will be either four or eight years.”



######### 9083.5.  
(a) If a candidate for nomination or election to a partisan office will appear on the ballot, the Secretary of State shall include in the state voter information guide a written explanation of the election procedure for such offices. The explanation shall read substantially similar to the following:

PARTY-NOMINATED/PARTISAN OFFICES

Under the California Constitution, political parties may formally nominate candidates for party-nominated/partisan offices at the primary election. A candidate so nominated will then represent that party as its official candidate for the office in question at the ensuing general election and the ballot will reflect an official designation to that effect. The top votegetter for each party at the primary election is entitled to participate in the general election. Parties also elect officers of official party committees at a partisan primary.

No voter may vote in the primary election of any political party other than the party he or she has disclosed a preference for upon registering to vote. However, a political party may authorize a person who has declined to disclose a party preference to vote in that party’s primary election.

(b) If any candidate for nomination or election to a voter-nominated office will appear on the ballot, the Secretary of State shall include in the state voter information guide a written explanation of the election procedure for such offices. The explanation shall read substantially similar to the following:

VOTER-NOMINATED OFFICES

Under the California Constitution, political parties are not entitled to formally nominate candidates for voter-nominated offices at the primary election. A candidate nominated for a voter-nominated office at the primary election is the nominee of the people and not the official nominee of any party at the following general election. A candidate for nomination or election to a voter-nominated office shall have his or her party preference, or lack of party preference, reflected on the primary and general election ballot, but the party preference designation is selected solely by the candidate and is shown for the information of the voters only. It does not constitute or imply an endorsement of the candidate by the party designated, or affiliation between the party and candidate, and no candidate nominated by the qualified voters for any voter-nominated office shall be deemed to be the officially nominated candidate of any political party. The parties may list the candidates for voter-nominated offices who have received the official endorsement of the party in the county voter information guide.

All voters may vote for any candidate for a voter-nominated office, provided they meet the other qualifications required to vote for that office. The top two votegetters at the primary election advance to the general election for the voter-nominated office, even if both candidates have specified the same party preference designation. A party is not entitled to have a candidate with its party preference designation participate in the general election unless such candidate is one of the two highest votegetters at the primary election.

(c) If any candidate for nomination or election to a nonpartisan office, other than judicial office, shall appear on the ballot, the Secretary of State shall include in the state voter information guide a written explanation of the election procedure for such offices. The explanation shall read substantially similar to the following:

NONPARTISAN OFFICES

Under the California Constitution, political parties are not entitled to nominate candidates for nonpartisan offices at the primary election, and a candidate nominated for a nonpartisan office at the primary election is not the official nominee of any party for the office in question at the ensuing general election. A candidate for nomination or election to a nonpartisan office may NOT designate his or her party preference, or lack of party preference, on the primary and general election ballot. The top two votegetters at the primary election advance to the general election for the nonpartisan office.

(d) Posters or other printed materials containing the notices specified in subdivisions (a) to (c), inclusive, shall be included in the precinct supplies pursuant to Section 14105.

(g) A written explanation of the judicial retention procedure as required by Section 9083.

The statement shall be submitted in accordance with timeframes and procedures set forth by the Secretary of State for the preparation of the state voter information guide.

(j) If the ballot contains a question on the confirmation or retention of a justice of the Supreme Court, information on justices of the Supreme Court who are subject to confirmation or retention.

(k) If the ballot contains an election for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States, a notice that refers voters to the Secretary of State’s internet website for information about candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States.

Any sections of the petition not so filed shall be void for all purposes.  Once filed, no petition section shall be amended except by order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

When the petition is filed, the county elections official shall determine the total number of signatures affixed to the petition.  If, from this examination, the county elections official determines that the number of signatures, prima facie, equals or is in excess of the minimum number of signatures required, the county elections official shall examine the petition in accordance with Section 9114 or 9115.  If, from this examination, the county elections official determines that the number of signatures, prima facie, does not equal or exceed the minimum number of signatures required, no further action shall be taken.

A certificate showing the results of this examination shall be attached to the petition.

In determining the number of valid signatures, the elections official may check the signatures against facsimiles of voters’ signatures provided that the method of preparing and displaying the facsimiles complies with law. A signature shall not be invalidated because of a variation of the signature caused by the substitution of initials for the first or middle name, or both, of the person signing the petition.

The elections official shall notify the proponents of the petition as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the petition.

If the petition is found insufficient, no further action shall be taken. However, the failure to secure sufficient signatures, shall not preclude the filing of a new petition on the same subject, at a later date.

(a) Within 30 days from the date of filing of the petition, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, if, from the examination of petitions pursuant to Section 9114 shows that more than 500 signatures have been signed on the petition, the elections official may use a random sampling technique for verification of signatures. The random sample of signatures to be verified shall be drawn so that every signature filed with the elections official shall be given an equal opportunity to be included in the sample. The random sampling shall include an examination of at least 500, or 3 percent of the signatures, whichever is greater. A signature shall not be invalidated because of a variation of the signature caused by the substitution of initials for the first or middle name, or both, of the person signing the petition.

(b) If the statistical sampling shows that the number of valid signatures is within 95 to 110 percent of the number of signatures of qualified voters needed to declare the petition sufficient, the elections official shall, within 60 days from the date of the filing of the petition, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, examine and verify the signatures filed. If the elections official determines, prior to completing the examination of each signature filed, that the petition is signed by the requisite number of qualified voters to declare the petition sufficient, the elections official may terminate the verification of the remaining unverified signatures.

(c) In determining from the records of registration, what number of valid signatures are signed on the petition, the elections official may check the signatures against facsimiles of voters’ signatures, provided that the method of preparing and displaying the facsimiles complies with law.

(d) The elections official shall attach to the petition a certificate showing the result of this examination and shall notify the proponents of either the sufficiency or insufficiency of the petition.

(e) If the petition is found insufficient, no action shall be taken on the petition. However, the failure to secure sufficient signatures shall not preclude the filing later of an entirely new petition to the same effect.

(f) If the petition is found to be sufficient, the elections official shall certify the results of the examination to the board of supervisors at the next regular meeting of the board.



######### 9118.  
If the initiative petition is signed by voters not less in number than 10 percent of the entire vote cast in the county for all candidates for Governor at the last gubernatorial election preceding the publication of the notice of intention to circulate an initiative petition, the board of supervisors shall do one of the following:

These titles may be shortened (e.g. “Senator” or “Sen.” for “State Senator” or “Asm.” for “Assembly Member”).

(C) An individual who is not a current or former elected official may be listed only with the individual’s first and last name and an honorific (e.g., “Dr.,” “M.D.,” “Ph.D.,” or “Esquire”), with no other title or designation, unless it is a title representing an association, nonprofit organization, or business that meets the requirements of subparagraph (A) or (B) and that is eligible to be listed under paragraph (1) if the individual supports the measure or under paragraph (2) if the individual opposes the measure.

(4) Spaces, commas, semicolons, and other characters count towards the 125-character limit in paragraphs (1) and (2).

If that text is not emphasized, then each letter of that text shall be capitalized.

(9) If including the list of Supporters and Opponents in the ballot labels as required by this section would necessitate the printing of an extra ballot card compared to the ballot labels not including them, the type size of the part of all of the ballot labels starting with “Supporters:” may be reduced by the minimal amount needed to stop them from necessitating an extra ballot card, as long as the type size is no smaller than 8-point and as long as the type size is reduced by the same amount for all ballot measures.

(1)  A county shall not include a list of supporters or opponents for any county, city, district, or school measure if the county does not include a list of supporters or opponents for all measures for which the county receives a list that meets the requirements of this section. If the county elects not to list supporters and opponents for county, city, district, or school measures on the county ballot, the requirements of subdivisions (a) through (c) do not apply.

(2) A district measure or school measure on a county ballot shall not include a list of supporters or opponents if the same district or school measure appears on the ballot of another county that does not include a list of supporters or opponents for the measure, in which case the requirements of subdivisions (a) through (c), inclusive, do not apply for the measure.

The random sampling shall include an examination of at least 500 or 5 percent of the signatures, whichever is greater.

Thereafter, for each succeeding Assembly district in which the candidates are to be voted on, the names appearing first in the last preceding Assembly district shall be placed last, the order of the other names remaining unchanged.

(e) If the office is that of State Senator or Member of the Assembly, the county elections official shall arrange the names of the candidates for the office in accordance with the randomized alphabet as provided for in Section 13112, unless the district encompasses more than one county, in which case the arrangement shall be made pursuant to subdivision (i).

However, the names of the judicial candidates shall not be rotated among the applicable districts.



######### 13112.  
The Secretary of State shall conduct a drawing of the letters of the alphabet, the result of which shall be known as a randomized alphabet. The procedure shall be as follows:

(a) Each letter of the alphabet shall be written on a separate slip of paper, each of which shall be folded and inserted into a capsule. Each capsule shall be opaque and of uniform weight, color, size, shape, and texture. The capsules shall be placed in a container, which shall be shaken vigorously in order to mix the capsules thoroughly. The container then shall be opened and the capsules removed at random one at a time. As each is removed, it shall be opened and the letter on the slip of paper read aloud and written down. The resulting random order of letters constitutes the randomized alphabet, which is to be used in the same manner as the conventional alphabet in determining the order of all candidates in all elections. For example, if two candidates with the surnames Campbell and Carlson are running for the same office, their order on the ballot will depend on the order in which the letters M and R were drawn in the randomized alphabet drawing.

(b) (1) There shall be six drawings, three in each even-numbered year and three in each odd-numbered year. Each drawing shall be held at 11 a.m. on the date specified in this subdivision. The results of each drawing shall be mailed immediately to each county elections official responsible for conducting an election to which the drawing is applicable, who shall use it in determining the order on the ballot of the names of the candidates for office.

(A) The first drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the April general law city elections of an even-numbered year, and shall apply to those elections and any other elections held at the same time.

(B) The second drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the direct primary of an even-numbered year, and shall apply to all candidates on the ballot in that election.

(C) (i) The third drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the November general election of an even-numbered year, and shall apply to all candidates on the ballot in the November general election.

(ii) In the case of the primary election and the November general election, the Secretary of State shall certify and transmit to each county elections official the order in which the names of federal and state candidates, with the exception of candidates for State Senate and Assembly, shall appear on the ballot. The elections official shall determine the order on the ballot of all other candidates using the appropriate randomized alphabet for that purpose.

(D) The fourth drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the March general law city elections of each odd-numbered year, and shall apply to those elections and any other elections held at the same time.

(E) The fifth drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the first Tuesday after the first Monday in June of each odd-numbered year, and shall apply to all candidates on the ballot in the elections held on that date.

(F) The sixth drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of the odd-numbered year, and shall apply to all candidates on the ballot in the elections held on that date.

(2) In the event there is to be an election of candidates to a special district, school district, charter city, or other local government body at the same time as one of the five major election dates specified in subparagraphs (A) to (F), inclusive, and the last possible day to file nomination papers for the local election would occur after the date of the drawing for the major election date, the procedure set forth in Section 13113 shall apply.

(c) Each randomized alphabet drawing shall be open to the public. At least 10 days prior to a drawing, the Secretary of State shall notify the news media and other interested parties of the date, time, and place of the drawing. The president of each statewide association of local officials with responsibilities for conducting elections shall be invited by the Secretary of State to attend each drawing or send a representative. The state chairman of each qualified political party shall be invited to attend or send a representative in the case of drawings held to determine the order of candidates on the primary election ballot, the November general election ballot, or a special election ballot as provided for in subdivision (d).

(d) In the case of any special election for State Assembly, State Senate, or Representative in Congress, on the first weekday after the close of filing of nomination papers for the office, the Secretary of State shall conduct a public drawing to produce a randomized alphabet in the same manner as provided for in subdivisions (a) and (c). The resulting randomized alphabet shall be used for determining the order on the ballot of the candidates in both the primary election for the special election and in the special election.



######### 13113.  
(a) In the case of an election of candidates in a special district, school district, charter city (whose charter does not provide to the contrary), or other local government body, occurring on other than one of the election dates specified in subdivision (b) of Section 13112, the official responsible for conducting the election shall, at the same time that the election is called, notify the Secretary of State by registered mail of the date of the election, the date of the close of filing, and the last possible date for filing in the event there is an extension of filing due to an incumbent failing to file. The Secretary of State shall conduct a randomized alphabet drawing pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 13112 on the first weekday following the last possible day of filing in the event there is an extension for the election.

(b) Except as provided for runoff elections in subdivision (d), if two or more drawings for local government elections would occur on the same date, the Secretary of State may use a single randomized alphabet drawing for all of these elections. The Secretary of State shall communicate the results of the drawing by registered mail to each respective official responsible for conducting the election who shall use it to determine the order on the ballot of all candidates’ names.

(c) All drawings held pursuant to this section shall be open to the public.

(d) If a charter city conducts a runoff election, it shall use the results of a randomized alphabet drawing separate from the results of the randomized alphabet drawing used for the initial election for that runoff election. The city shall, within three days following the initial election, notify the Secretary of State by registered mail of the date of the election and request that he or she conduct a randomized alphabet drawing for the runoff election. The Secretary of State shall immediately conduct a randomized alphabet drawing for the runoff election and communicate the results of the drawing to the elections official responsible for conducting the runoff election who shall use the results to determine the order of all the candidates’ names on the ballot. The results of the randomized alphabet drawing shall be clearly labeled “FOR USE IN A RUNOFF ELECTION ONLY.”



######### 13114.  
(a) At any regular meeting of a city council held prior to the date on which the Secretary of State conducts the randomized alphabet drawing applicable to the regular municipal election under Section 13112, or, under Section 13113, applicable to a special election called to fill a vacancy on the city council, the city council may, by resolution, provide for the rotation on the ballot of the names of candidates for any elective city office.

(b) A resolution adopted pursuant to subdivision (a) shall specify which regular statewide election precincts or, if precincts have been consolidated for purposes of the city election, which consolidated precincts, shall constitute each cluster of precincts for purposes of the rotation of candidates’ names on the ballot.

(c) (1) As used in this section, a “cluster” shall consist of one or more precincts which need not be contiguous. The clusters of precincts shall be numbered in consecutive order for purposes of ballot rotation of candidates’ names, and the resolution shall list the clusters by number and identify which precincts are in each cluster.

(2) No cluster of precincts shall contain a number of registered voters which is more than 10 percent greater or lesser than the average number of registered voters for a cluster as of the most recent estimate by the county elections official of the number of registered voters in each regular precinct in the city prior to the adoption of the resolution. The resolution shall set forth the total number of registered voters in each cluster.

(d) A resolution adopted pursuant to subdivision (a) shall specify that, in the cluster designated as cluster number one, the names shall appear on the ballot in the order determined by the Secretary of State’s randomized alphabet drawing. For each successive cluster, the resolution shall specify the manner of determining the order of the candidates’ names by applying the following:

(1) If the number of candidates for an office is equal to or less than the number of clusters, in cluster number two and each successive cluster, the name appearing first in the last preceding cluster shall be placed last, the order of the other names remaining unchanged.

(2) If the number of candidates for an office is greater than the number of clusters, the former shall be divided by the latter. If the resulting quotient is a mixed number and the fractional part of the mixed number is less than one-half, the fraction shall be discarded. If the fractional part of the mixed number is one-half or greater, the quotient shall be raised to the next largest whole number. The whole number that results from this process shall be the number of candidates that, in cluster number two and each successive cluster, shall be taken from the beginning of the list and placed at the end of the list, the order of the other names remaining unchanged.

(e) (1) No city may provide for rotation of candidates’ names on the ballot for a particular election unless the resolution authorizing it, in accordance with this section, is adopted by the city council at a regular meeting, at which the city elections official has provided cost estimates of this rotation, prior to the date of the randomized alphabet drawing applicable to the election.

(2) A city council resolution that provides for rotation of candidates’ names pursuant to this section for any election which is consolidated with any county or state election shall also provide for the payment of computer programming, formatting, preparation, and all similar related administrative costs associated with development of the ballot on which those names appear.

(b) An elections official may commence designating local measures with any letter of the alphabet following the letter “A,” and continuing in alphabetical order, in order to avoid voter confusion that might result from different local measures carrying the same letter designation in successive elections.

(c) Where two or more counties or cities submitting measures to the voters are in close proximity, the elections officials of those counties or cities may mutually agree to use letter designation for ballot measures that will not conflict or confuse the voter.



######### 13117.  
(a) Commencing with the November 3, 1998, general election, all state measures in all elections at which state measures are submitted to a vote of the voters shall be numbered in a continuous sequence, commencing with the number “1” and continuing in numerical sequence for a period of 10 years from the year of commencement.

(b) At the completion of a 10-year cycle, the numbering sequence shall recommence with the number “1” at the next election at which state measures are submitted to a vote of the voters.

(a) The candidate may, at the time of filing the candidate’s nomination paper, or within five days after the time for filing nomination papers has expired, file with the elections official a statement that shall be in substance as follows:

“I ____, believe that another person, whose name is so similar to mine that it may be confused with mine, has filed or will file a nomination paper for the same office for which I have filed a nomination paper, and I therefore request and direct that the elections official assign a number to each candidate with a similar name to be printed on the ballot as a distinguishing mark.


|
 _____ 
|
 _____ Name
|
||
Candidate for the office

of  ”
|
(b) The distinguishing mark shall be a number, commencing with the number “1” and continuing in numerical sequence until each candidate with a similar name has been assigned a distinguishing number, and shall be printed at the right of the name on the ballot.

(c) The first candidate who filed the candidate’s nomination papers shall have the number “1” and each subsequent candidate, based on the time of filing the candidate’s nomination papers, shall be assigned the next number in numerical sequence.

(d) In addition to the designated numbers that the elections official shall place on the ballot when the above conditions are met, the elections official shall place on the ballot, immediately preceding the names of the candidates to be voted upon, or on the contest header if there is not sufficient space immediately preceding the name, the following warning:

“Warning!   There are two (or applicable number) candidates for this office with identical names.”

This warning shall also be included, in a prominent manner, on any state voter information guide, county voter information guide, or other mailing sent by the elections official, before the election, to persons eligible to vote for this office.

If a voter marks the voting target next to the printed word “Yes,” the voter’s vote shall be counted in favor of the adoption of the measure. If the voter marks the voting target next to the printed word “No,” the voter’s vote shall be counted against its adoption.

(b) If the proposed measure imposes a tax or raises the rate of a tax, the ballot shall include in the statement of the measure to be voted on the amount of money to be raised annually and the rate and duration of the tax to be levied.

(c) The statement of the measure shall be a true and impartial synopsis of the purpose of the proposed measure, and shall be in language that is neither argumentative nor likely to create prejudice for or against the measure.

A mark of the voting target next to the name of a party and its presidential and vice presidential candidate, is a vote for all of the electors of that party, but for no other candidates.”

(c) If a group of candidates for electors has been nominated under Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 8400) of Division 8, and has under Chapter 1 (commencing at Section 8300) of Division 8 designated the names of the candidates for President and Vice President of the United States for whom those candidates have pledged themselves to vote, the instructions to voters shall also contain the following:

The ballots may contain printed and distinguishing marks if secrecy in voting is protected.



######### 13217.  
(a) The number on each ballot shall be the same as that on the corresponding stub, and the ballots and stubs shall be numbered consecutively in each county, or the ballots and stubs may be numbered consecutively within each combination of congressional, senatorial, and Assembly districts in each county.

(c) The names of the candidates, including the blank space or spaces necessary to permit the voter to write in the names of persons not printed on the ballot, shall be apportioned as equally as possible between the two columns.  The odd space, if any, shall be included in the left-hand column.

(d) The double column shall be used for no more than one office and for no more than one term for any office.

Vote by mail voter ballots so prepared shall be counted by the counting device.



######### 13267.

If the candidate is running in a multicounty district, the elections official of each county shall accept the form from the candidate’s county of residence; however, the candidate shall provide a hard copy of the candidate statement form and payment of the requisite fee to each county.

######### 13309.  
(a) Notwithstanding Section 13307, if a candidate alleges to be indigent and unable to pay in advance the requisite fee for submitting a candidate statement, the candidate shall submit to the local agency a statement of financial worth to be used in determining whether or not he or she is eligible to submit a candidate statement without payment of the fee in advance.

(b) The statement of financial worth required by this section shall be submitted by the candidate together with his or her candidate statement in accordance with the deadline specified in Section 13307.

######### 14000.  
(a) If a voter does not have sufficient time outside of working hours to vote at a statewide election, the voter may, without loss of pay, take off enough working time that, when added to the voting time available outside of working hours, will enable the voter to vote.

(b) No more than two hours of the time taken off for voting shall be without loss of pay.  The time off for voting shall be only at the beginning or end of the regular working shift, whichever allows the most free time for voting and the least time off from the regular working shift, unless otherwise mutually agreed.

(c) If the employee on the third working day prior to the day of election, knows or has reason to believe that time off will be necessary to be able to vote on election day, the employee shall give the employer at least two working days’ notice that time off for voting is desired, in accordance with this section.



######### 14001.  
Not less than 10 days before every statewide election, every employer shall keep posted conspicuously at the place of work, if practicable, or elsewhere where it can be seen as employees come or go to their place of work, a notice setting forth the provisions of Section 14000.

(b) This section does not prohibit an employer from encouraging an employee to vote.







##### CHAPTER 1.5. Rights of Voters [14025 - 14032]  

######### 14025.  
This act shall be known and may be cited as the California Voting Rights Act of 2001.



######### 14026.  
As used in this chapter:

(a) “At-large method of election” means any of the following methods of electing members to the governing body of a political subdivision:

(1) One in which the voters of the entire jurisdiction elect the members to the governing body.

(2) One in which the candidates are required to reside within given areas of the jurisdiction and the voters of the entire jurisdiction elect the members to the governing body.

(3) One that combines at-large elections with district-based elections.

(b) “District-based elections” means a method of electing members to the governing body of a political subdivision in which the candidate must reside within an election district that is a divisible part of the political subdivision and is elected only by voters residing within that election district.

(c) “Political subdivision” means a geographic area of representation created for the provision of government services, including, but not limited to, a general law city, general law county, charter city, charter county, charter city and county, school district, community college district, or other district organized pursuant to state law.

(d) “Protected class” means a class of voters who are members of a race, color, or language minority group, as this class is referenced and defined in the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. Sec. 10301 et seq.).

(e) “Racially polarized voting” means voting in which there is a difference, as defined in case law regarding enforcement of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. Sec. 10301 et seq.), in the choice of candidates or other electoral choices that are preferred by voters in a protected class, and in the choice of candidates and electoral choices that are preferred by voters in the rest of the electorate. The methodologies for estimating group voting behavior as approved in applicable federal cases to enforce the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. Sec. 10301 et seq.) to establish racially polarized voting may be used for purposes of this section to prove that elections are characterized by racially polarized voting.



######### 14027.  
An at-large method of election may not be imposed or applied in a manner that impairs the ability of a protected class to elect candidates of its choice or its ability to influence the outcome of an election, as a result of the dilution or the abridgment of the rights of voters who are members of a protected class, as defined pursuant to Section 14026.



######### 14028.  
(a) A violation of Section 14027 is established if it is shown that racially polarized voting occurs in elections for members of the governing body of the political subdivision or in elections incorporating other electoral choices by the voters of the political subdivision.  Elections conducted prior to the filing of an action pursuant to Section 14027 and this section are more probative to establish the existence of racially polarized voting than elections conducted after the filing of the action.

(b) The occurrence of racially polarized voting shall be determined from examining results of elections in which at least one candidate is a member of a protected class or elections involving ballot measures, or other electoral choices that affect the rights and privileges of members of a protected class.  One circumstance that may be considered in determining a violation of Section 14027 and this section is the extent to which candidates who are members of a protected class and who are preferred by voters of the protected class, as determined by an analysis of voting behavior, have been elected to the governing body of a political subdivision that is the subject of an action based on Section 14027 and this section. In multiseat at-large election districts, where the number of candidates who are members of a protected class is fewer than the number of seats available, the relative groupwide support received by candidates from members of a protected class shall be the basis for the racial polarization analysis.

(c) The fact that members of a protected class are not geographically compact or concentrated may not preclude a finding of racially polarized voting, or a violation of Section 14027 and this section, but may be a factor in determining an appropriate remedy.

(d) Proof of an intent on the part of the voters or elected officials to discriminate against a protected class is not required.

(e) Other factors such as the history of discrimination, the use of electoral devices or other voting practices or procedures that may enhance the dilutive effects of at-large elections, denial of access to those processes determining which groups of candidates will receive financial or other support in a given election, the extent to which members of a protected class bear the effects of past discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process, and the use of overt or subtle racial appeals in political campaigns are probative, but not necessary factors to establish a violation of Section 14027 and this section.



######### 14029.  
Upon a finding of a violation of Section 14027 and Section 14028, the court shall implement appropriate remedies, including the imposition of district-based elections, that are tailored to remedy the violation.



######### 14030.  
In any action to enforce Section 14027 and Section 14028, the court shall allow the prevailing plaintiff party, other than the state or political subdivision thereof, a reasonable attorney’s fee consistent with the standards established in Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48-49, and litigation expenses including, but not limited to, expert witness fees and expenses as part of the costs.  Prevailing defendant parties shall not recover any costs, unless the court finds the action to be frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.



######### 14031.  
This chapter is enacted to implement the guarantees of Section 7 of Article I and of Section 2 of Article II of the California Constitution.



######### 14032.  
Any voter who is a member of a protected class and who resides in a political subdivision where a violation of Sections 14027 and 14028 is alleged may file an action pursuant to those sections in the superior court of the county in which the political subdivision is located.







##### CHAPTER 1.7. Voter Participation [14050 - 14057]  

######### 14050.  
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the California Voter Participation Rights Act.



######### 14051.  
As used in this chapter:

(a) “Political subdivision” means a geographic area of representation created for the provision of government services, including, but not limited to, a city, a school district, a community college district, or other district organized pursuant to state law.

(b) “Significant decrease in voter turnout” means the voter turnout for a regularly scheduled election in a political subdivision is at least 25 percent less than the average voter turnout within that political subdivision for the previous four statewide general elections.

(c) “Voter turnout” means the percentage of voters who are eligible to cast ballots within a given political subdivision who voted.



######### 14052.  
(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), a political subdivision shall not hold an election other than on a statewide election date if holding an election on a nonconcurrent date has previously resulted in a significant decrease in voter turnout.

(b) A political subdivision may hold an election other than on a statewide election date if, by January 1, 2018, the political subdivision has adopted a plan to consolidate a future election with a statewide election not later than the November 8, 2022, statewide general election.



######### 14053.  
Upon a finding of a violation of subdivision (a) of Section 14052, the court shall implement appropriate remedies, including the imposition of concurrent election dates for future elections and the upgrade of voting equipment or systems to do so. In imposing remedies pursuant to this section, a court may also require a county board of supervisors to approve consolidation pursuant to Section 10402.5.



######### 14054.  
In an action to enforce subdivision (a) of Section 14052, the court shall allow the prevailing plaintiff other than the state or political subdivision of the state, a reasonable attorney’s fee consistent with the standards established in Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48-49, and litigation expenses including, but not limited to, expert witness fees and expenses as part of the costs. A prevailing defendant shall not recover any costs, unless the court finds the action to be frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.



######### 14055.  
A voter who resides in a political subdivision where a violation of subdivision (a) of Section 14052 is alleged may file an action pursuant to that section in the superior court of the county in which the political subdivision is located.



######### 14056.  
This chapter does not apply to special elections.



######### 14057.  
This chapter shall become operative on January 1, 2018.

(2) The number of party ballots to be furnished to any precinct for a primary election shall be computed from the number of voters registered in that precinct as intending to affiliate with a party, and the number of nonpartisan ballots to be furnished to any precinct shall be computed from the number of voters registered in that precinct without statement of intention to affiliate with any of the parties participating in the primary election.

(b) For all other elections, the elections official shall provide a sufficient number of official ballots in each precinct to reasonably meet the needs of the voters in that precinct on election day, using the precinct’s voter turnout history as the criterion, but in no case shall this number be less than 75 percent of the number of registered voters in the precinct, and for vote by mail and emergency purposes shall provide the additional number of ballots that may be necessary.

(c) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), in elections conducted using voter centers, the elections official shall provide sufficient materials for voting.



######### 14103.

######### 14201.  
(a) In counties and precincts where the Secretary of State has determined that it is appropriate, the county elections official shall provide facsimile copies of the ballot, as described in subdivision (b), with the ballot measures and ballot instructions printed in Spanish, one of which shall be posted in a conspicuous location in the polling place and at least one of which shall be made available for voters at the polling place to use as a reference when casting a private ballot. Facsimile ballots shall also be printed in other languages and provided in the same manner if a significant and substantial need is found by the Secretary of State. A facsimile copy of the ballot available for voters to use in casting a private ballot shall be sufficiently distinct in appearance from a regular ballot to prevent voters from attempting to vote on the facsimile copy.

(b) (1) In determining if it is appropriate to provide the election materials in Spanish or other languages, the Secretary of State shall determine the number of residents of voting age in each county and precinct who are members of a single language minority, and who lack sufficient skills in English to vote without assistance. If the number of these residents equals 3 percent or more of the voting-age residents of a particular county or precinct, or if interested citizens or organizations provide the Secretary of State with information that gives the Secretary of State sufficient reason to believe a need for the furnishing of facsimile ballots, the Secretary of State shall find a need to provide at least two facsimile copies with the ballot measures and ballot instructions printed in Spanish or other applicable language in the affected polling places.

(2) If the Secretary of State determines that the number of voting-age residents in a precinct who are members of a single language minority and who lack sufficient skills in English to vote without assistance exceeds 20 percent of the voting-age residents in that precinct, the county elections official shall provide at least four facsimile copies of the ballot in the language of that language minority, one of which shall be posted in a conspicuous location in the polling place and at least three of which shall be made available for voters at the polling place to use as a reference when casting a private ballot.

(c) (1) In polling places where facsimile copies of the ballot are necessary, members of the precinct boards shall be trained on the purpose and proper handling of the facsimile copies of the ballot and shall be prepared to inform voters of the existence of the facsimile copies of the ballot, as appropriate.

(2) If a voter requests a facsimile copy of a ballot that is available in the voter’s language of preference pursuant to subdivision (a), a member of the precinct board shall provide the facsimile copy of the ballot to the voter.

(3) In polling places where facsimile copies of the ballot are necessary, a sign near the roster shall inform voters of the existence of the facsimile copies of the ballot. The sign shall be in English and in the language or languages of the facsimile copies available in that polling place.

(d) At least 14 days before an election, the county elections official shall provide information on the county elections internet website identifying all polling places in the county and the languages of facsimile copies of the ballot that will be available to voters at each polling place. Explanatory information pertaining to the list of polling places, but not the list itself, shall be available in all languages in which the county provides facsimile copies of the ballot.

(e) The county elections official shall include text in the county voter information guide that refers voters with language needs to the portion of the county elections internet website containing the information specified in subdivision (d). The text shall be in all languages in which the county provides facsimile copies of the ballot.

Sec. 10101 et seq.).

(2) In a polling place where a county elections official is required pursuant to subdivision (a) to provide a facsimile copy of the ballot in a language other than English, the county elections official may instead provide voters with a ballot translated into that language. A county elections official who provides and publicizes translated ballots in the same manner as translated ballots provided and publicized pursuant to Section 203 of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. Sec. 10101 et seq.), in lieu of providing facsimile copies of the ballot in any language required under subdivision (a), need not comply with subdivisions (c), (d), and (e) as pertaining to that language.

(h) It is the intent of the Legislature that non-English-speaking citizens, like all other citizens, should be encouraged to vote. Therefore, appropriate efforts should be made on a statewide basis to minimize obstacles to voting by citizens who lack sufficient skill in English to vote without assistance.



######### 14202.  
(a) Before opening the polls, the precinct board shall post in separate, convenient places at or near the polling place, and of easy access to the voters, at least one printed copy of the voter list for that polling place. The copies of the voter list shall be by street address in numerical order.

The elections official shall transmit for processing any ballot cast, including any materials necessary to process the ballot, pursuant to this section to the elections official in the county where the voter is registered to vote.

(b) To be counted, a ballot cast pursuant to this section shall satisfy both of the following requirements:

(d) Consistent with Section 2025, the Citizens Redistricting Commission shall deem each incarcerated person as residing at that person’s last known place of residence, rather than at the institution of that person’s incarceration, and shall use the information furnished to it pursuant to subdivision (a) in carrying out its redistricting responsibilities under Article XXI of the California Constitution. The Citizens Redistricting Commission shall also do all of the following when it uses information regarding inmates that is furnished pursuant to this section:

(1) Deem an inmate incarcerated in a state correctional facility for whom the last known place of residence is either outside California or cannot be determined, or an inmate in federal custody in a facility within California, to reside at an unknown geographical location in the state and exclude the inmate from the population count for any district, ward, or precinct.

(2) Adjust race and ethnicity data in districts, wards, and precincts that contain prisons in a manner that reflects reductions in the local population as inmates are included in the population count of the district, ward, or precinct of their last known place of residence and, to the extent practicable, those deemed to reside at an unknown geographic location.

(e) (1) For purposes of this section, “last known place of residence” means the most recent residential address of an inmate before the inmate’s most current term of incarceration that is sufficiently specific to be assigned to a census block, as determined from information furnished by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation in accordance with this section. In the case of an inmate for whom residential address information is available but is not sufficiently specific to allow the address to be assigned to a census block, the “last known place of residence” means a randomly determined census block located within the smallest geographical area that can be identified based on the residential address information furnished by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

 (2) For purposes of this section, “state correctional facility” means a facility under the control of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.







##### CHAPTER 6. Supervisorial Districts [21500 - 21509]  

######### 21500.  
(a) Following a county’s decision to elect its board using district-based elections, or following each federal decennial census for a county whose board is already elected using district-based elections, the board shall, by ordinance or resolution, adopt boundaries for all of the supervisorial districts of the county so that the supervisorial districts shall be substantially equal in population as required by the United States Constitution.

(1) Population equality shall be based on the total population of residents of the county as determined by the most recent federal decennial census for which the redistricting data described in Public Law 94-171 are available.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an incarcerated person, as that term is used in Section 21003, shall not be counted towards a county’s population, except for an incarcerated person whose last known place of residence may be assigned to a census block in the county, if information about the last known place of residence for incarcerated persons is included in the computerized database for redistricting that is developed in accordance with subdivision (b) of Section 8253 of the Government Code, and that database is made publicly available.

Communities of interest do not include relationships with political parties, incumbents, or political candidates.

(3) To the extent practicable, the geographic integrity of a city or census designated place shall be respected in a manner that minimizes its division.

(b) This section does not prohibit a board from adopting supervisorial districts between federal decennial censuses if the board is adopting supervisorial districts for the first time, including when a board adopts supervisorial districts for the purpose of transitioning from electing its supervisors in at-large elections to elections by districts or from districts.



######### 21506.  
(a) The term of office of any supervisor who has been elected and whose term of office has not expired shall not be affected by any change in the boundaries of the district from which the supervisor was elected.

The time of the public hearing shall be noticed to the public.

(e) The board may have county staff or a consultant conduct one or more public workshops in lieu of holding one of the public hearings required by paragraph (1) of subdivision (a).

##### ARTICLE 2. Chartered Cities [21620 - 21630]  

######### 21620.  
(a) This article applies to a charter city that elects members of the city’s legislative body by districts or from districts, as defined in Section 34871 of the Government Code.

(b) This article shall not be interpreted to limit the discretionary remedial authority of any federal or state court.



######### 21621.  
(a) Following a city’s decision to elect its council using district-based elections, or following each federal decennial census for a city whose council is already elected using district-based elections, the council shall, by ordinance or resolution, adopt boundaries for all of the council districts of the city so that the council districts shall be substantially equal in population as required by the United States Constitution.

(1) Population equality shall be based on the total population of residents of the city as determined by the most recent federal decennial census for which the redistricting data described in Public Law 94-171 are available.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an incarcerated person, as that term is used in Section 21003, shall not be counted towards a city’s population, except for an incarcerated person whose last known place of residence may be assigned to a census block in the city, if information about the last known place of residence for incarcerated persons is included in the computerized database for redistricting that is developed in accordance with subdivision (b) of Section 8253 of the Government Code, and that database is made publicly available.

(b) The council shall adopt council district boundaries that comply with the United States Constitution, the California Constitution, and the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. Sec. 10301 et seq.).

(c) The council shall adopt district boundaries using the following criteria as set forth in the following order of priority:

(1) To the extent practicable, council districts shall be geographically contiguous. Areas that meet only at the points of adjoining corners are not contiguous. Areas that are separated by water and not connected by a bridge, tunnel, or regular ferry service are not contiguous.

(2) To the extent practicable, the geographic integrity of any local neighborhood or local community of interest shall be respected in a manner that minimizes its division. A “community of interest” is a population that shares common social or economic interests that should be included within a single district for purposes of its effective and fair representation. Communities of interest do not include relationships with political parties, incumbents, or political candidates.

(3) Council district boundaries should be easily identifiable and understandable by residents. To the extent practicable, council districts shall be bounded by natural and artificial barriers, by streets, or by the boundaries of the city.

(4) To the extent practicable, and where it does not conflict with the preceding criteria in this subdivision, council districts shall be drawn to encourage geographical compactness in a manner that nearby areas of population are not bypassed in favor of more distant populations.

(d) The council shall not adopt council district boundaries for the purpose of favoring or discriminating against a political party.

(e) Subdivision (c) does not apply to a charter city that has adopted comprehensive or exclusive redistricting criteria in its city charter. For purposes of this subdivision, “comprehensive or exclusive” means either that the city’s charter excludes consideration of redistricting criteria other than those that are identified in the city charter or that the city’s charter provides two or more traditional criteria for redistricting other than the requirement that districts be equal in population.

(f) For purposes of this article, “adopt” or “adoption” in regard to council district boundaries means the passage of an ordinance or resolution specifying those boundaries.



######### 21622.  
(a) (1) For redistricting occurring in 2031 and thereafter, the boundaries of the council districts shall be adopted by the council not later than 205 days before the city’s next regular election occurring after January 1 in each year ending in the number two.

(2) For redistricting occurring before 2031 and where a city has a regular election occurring after January 1, 2022 and before July 1, 2022, the boundaries of the council districts shall be adopted by the council not later than 174 days before that election. For cities that charge candidates a filing fee, notwithstanding subdivision (b) of Section 8106, the forms required under that subdivision shall not be made available until at least 28 days after the adoption of a final map. The elections official shall reduce the required number of signatures for the in-lieu-filing-fee petition, as specified in subdivision (a) of Section 8106, by the same proportion as the reduction in time for the candidate to collect signatures.

(3) For redistricting occurring before 2031 and where a city does not have a regular election occurring after January 1, 2022 and before July 1, 2022, the boundaries of the council districts shall be adopted by the council not later than 205 days before the city’s next regular election occurring on or after July 1, 2022.

(2) The population of the new territory being annexed or consolidated is greater than 25 percent of the city’s population as determined by the most recent federal decennial census.

(c) This section does not apply to a charter city that has adopted, by ordinance or in its city charter, a different standard for adding new territory to existing council districts.



######### 21625.  
(a) After redistricting or districting pursuant to Section 21621 or 21623, a council shall not adopt new council district boundaries until after the next federal decennial census, except under the following circumstances:

(1) A court orders the council to redistrict.

(2) The council is settling a legal claim that its council district boundaries violate the United States Constitution, the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. Sec. 10301 et seq.), or this article.

(3) The boundaries of the city change by the addition of territory pursuant to Section 21623 or by the subtraction of territory.

(b) This section does not prohibit a council from adopting council districts between federal decennial censuses if the council is adopting council districts for the first time, including when a city adopts council districts for the purpose of transitioning from electing its council members in at-large elections to elections by districts or from districts.

(c) This section does not apply to a charter city that has adopted different rules for mid-cycle redistricting in its city charter.



######### 21626.

(b) At the first election for council members in each city following adoption of the boundaries of council districts, excluding a special election to fill a vacancy or a recall election, a council member shall be elected for each district under the new district plan that has the same district number as a district whose incumbent’s term is due to expire. This subdivision does not apply when a city transitions from at-large to district-based elections.

(c) For a city employing both a primary and a general election, a change in the boundaries of a council district shall not be made between the direct primary election and the general election. 

(d) Except as provided in subdivision (a), a person is not eligible to hold office as a member of a city council unless that person meets the requirements of Section 201 of the Elections Code and Section 34882 of the Government Code.

Before adopting the boundaries of a council district pursuant to Section 21621 or 21623, or for any other reason, the council shall hold public hearings on the proposal in accordance with Section 21627.1. This section does not apply when a city transitions from at-large to district-based elections.

(f) The council may establish an advisory redistricting commission to hold the public hearings required by paragraph (1) of subdivision (a).



######### 21628.  
(a) The council shall take steps to encourage residents, including those in underrepresented communities and non-English speaking communities, to participate in the redistricting public review process. These steps shall include a good faith effort to do all of the following:

(1) Providing information to media organizations that provide city news coverage, including media organizations that serve language minority communities.

(2) Providing information through good government, civil rights, civic engagement, and community groups or organizations that are active in the city, including those active in language minority communities, and those that have requested to be notified concerning city redistricting.

(b) The council shall arrange for the live translation in an applicable language of a public hearing or workshop held pursuant to this article if a request for translation is made at least 72 hours before the hearing or workshop, unless less than five days’ notice are provided for the hearing or workshop, in which case the request shall be made at least 48 hours before the hearing or workshop.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 54954.2 of the Government Code, the council shall publish the date, time, and location for any public hearing or workshop on the internet at least five days before the hearing or workshop. However, if there are fewer than 28 days until the deadline to adopt boundaries, the council may publish the agenda on the internet for at least three days before the hearing or workshop.

(d) (1) A draft map shall be published on the internet for at least seven days before being adopted as a final map by the council provided that, if there are fewer than 28 days until the deadline to adopt boundaries, the draft map may instead be published on the internet for at least three days.

(B) If the period of time between the date that the redistricting database is made publicly available and the map adoption deadline is fewer than 90 days and more than 59 days, then the waiting period required by subparagraph (A) is reduced to one week. If the period of time between the date that the redistricting database is made publicly available and the map adoption deadline is fewer than 60 days, then the waiting period required by subparagraph (A) is waived.
